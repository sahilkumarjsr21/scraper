Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.529 accounts are most popular because they offer excellent tax advantages. But irrevocable trusts provide the greatest flexibility. What’s right for your family?In the United States, even if you’re wealthy, you may fret about how best to fund your children’s education. That’s unsurprising, given that costs can run as high as $85,000 a year per child at some of the nation’s most expensive high schools and colleges.
Fortunately, there are several ways U.S. taxpayers might organize their finances to most economically foot these hefty bills.
1
The simplest and, as it happens, most tax-efficient way to provide for your children’s education is to pay as you go. Unfortunately, this approach is also the riskiest: No one can say what obstacles might arise before you’re finished paying for schooling.
However, there are three ways to set aside money to help you better ensure funds will be available to support your children’s education: a 529 account, an irrevocable trust for the benefit of the child
2
and a Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) account. All three are a form of forced savings—a parent, grandparent or another relative creates an account for a child’s benefit and contributes to it, whether all at once or over the years. That fund, and its earnings, can grow over time and become a pool of wealth that the family draws on to pay the educational expenses.
Which option is right for you and your family? This article can help you decide.
What others are doing
We find that Private Bank clients favor trusts and 529 accounts over UTMA accounts. Many dislike the potential for UTMA assets to wind up in the hands of a young adult. With UTMA accounts, the child generally gains complete control of all the assets at age 21.
As for 529 accounts and irrevocable trusts, we find that clients with the largest fortunes tend to choose trusts to fund their children’s education, while those with slightly less tend to rely on 529s. Some (at all wealth levels) use both. Here’s why:
Irrevocable trusts
An irrevocable trust is costly but also the most flexible. To set up and manage a trust properly, you should have an estate planning lawyer draft the trust document, then hire a trustee to administer and invest the trust assets.
The reasons people go through the effort and expense of irrevocable trusts are clear:
Trusts may grow and last
—Trusts can grow to whatever size their investment performance allows. By contrast, legal constraints limit how much can be contributed to a 529 account, thus limiting an account’s growth potential. An irrevocable trust also can continue to benefit the child for years, even for the child’s entire life (as long as the trust agreement so provides). Trust assets will be excluded from the donor’s estate
Trust assets might be used for many purposes
—Trust assets can be used for any purpose, even those having nothing to do with education (as long as the trust agreement so provides)
Trusts can help you transfer wealth to the next generation
—The income generated by an irrevocable trust is subject to income tax, but your trust agreement could stipulate that you (as the grantor) will pay those taxes as long as you live. That way, the trust assets grow free of income taxes, and you transfer more money out of your estate free of estate taxes
529 accounts
Given all the advantages of a trust, why would a parent with great wealth opt for a 529 when the funds in those accounts can only be used for education?
The answer is that 529 accounts can be easily established and managed, and—most importantly—they offer superior tax advantages:
They’re tax-free
—So long as its funds are used for educational expenses, no taxes are paid on either 529 account funds’ earnings or distributions for the child’s benefit, and the assets are excluded from the grantor’s estate (as long as the grantor outlives any “superfunded” period)
Contributions are potentially deductible
—Many states allow donors to deduct, against their state income taxes, contributions made to 529 accounts administered by the state of which there are a resident
They offer “superfundability”
—Donors can, if they like, contribute five years’ worth of their annual exclusion gifts to as many 529 accounts for different children as they like without using any of their lifetime gift tax exclusion (which in 2023 is $12.92 million)
In 2023, that would be five times the $17,000 annual gift exclusion, for a total of $85,000 (or $170,000 for a married couple) to each 529 account. Say, for example, you have three children: You could contribute a total of $255,000 (or $510,000, if married) to your children’s education free of gift taxes this year.
The 529’s super funding ability—unique in U.S. tax law—is evidence of Congress’s desire to make it easier for parents to save for their children’s education, and a recent legislative development underscores Congress’s bias in favor of 529 accounts. The so-called SECURE Act 2.0
3
has a measure designed to fix a problem that has been growing since the law creating 529s was enacted in 1997. Many families
overfunded
529 accounts and were left with tax problems after the beneficiaries (and other family members) had completed their educations.
Before the SECURE Act 2.0, there would be either income or gift tax consequences, perhaps to the parents or perhaps to the children, once any funds not used for the children’s education left the account. But now, thanks to the SECURE Act 2.0, the beneficiary of an overfunded 529 account can, without tax consequences, put up to $35,000 during their lifetime of the extra funds into a Roth IRA.

We can help
What’s best for you and your family depends on many factors, including your balance sheet, the nature of your income stream and portfolio, other family members’ potential contributions—and your children’s aspirations.
Whether your child is newborn or about to enter college, or even graduate school, your J.P. Morgan advisor can help you and your tax advisors select the education funding solution that suits you.1

The trust must be “irrevocable”—meaning that the grantor has given the funds away and cannot reclaim them—to maximize the estate and gift tax benefits of the trust, as well as to prevent the grantor from being tempted to reclaim the funds.

To help you target the right approach to leaving your legacy, Adam Clark provides insights on 4 commonly asked questions and concerns he has addressed over the years while working with wealthy families.
How do I build a sound estate plan?
My distribution process with my trustee is cumbersome.
Is my trust invested in the best way?
Have I outgrown my current situation?Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.
Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.TrusteesLegacyEstate PlanningJPMorgan Chase & Co.Trusts & EstatesPlease tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Thank you for taking a few minutes to listen to this audiocast. My name is Adam Clark and I’m the Global Head of Trusts & Estates at JP Morgan. Today I’m going to cover four common topics that I’ve seen families frequently ask about in my 25+ year career in Trusts & Estates.
First topic that is often discussed is how to build a sound estate plan? I hear people say that the fear of mortality is the biggest reason why people don’t engage in effective estate planning, but that’s not my experience. I think the two biggest challenges are the dread of going through the exercise and making some tough decisions about one’s family and legacy. Whilst also true that most people aren’t too excited about writing a check to attorneys to draft the documents, most families would happily pay the fees if the finished estate plan miraculously appeared in their inbox. It can be intimidating to find and engage the right attorney, enter the complex world of trusts and estates, review pages and pages of draft documents and to decide how to distribute assets to your descendants. Most clients want to leave assets to their children and grandchildren but are terrified of spoiling them and disincentivizing them. Paralysis of making a bad decision is usually worse than doing nothing. Many estate plans can be changed or completely revoked and restarted, so don’t get too focused on making it perfect. There is no such thing as a perfect estate plan.
I think the best way to start creating an estate plan is to bite off small pieces at a time. It’s not unusual for some of our larger families, over time, to have dozens of trusts for different purposes, such as charity, children, grandchildren as well as trusts for different strategies, such as mitigating estate tax exposure, or protection from creditors. The number of trusts can also accumulate over time as one’s balance sheet, family dynamics and outlook changes. It will become too overwhelming to undertake a lifetime of estate planning in one go, so start small with a will and revocable trust. If you have a young family make sure guardians are appointed (and make sure you tell them!). You can build over time, adding complexity and incorporating tax planning strategies, but biting off too much too soon will put you off finishing anything. Choosing the right attorney is also important. He or she obviously needs to be a competent estate planning attorney, but also make sure you connect well. If you build a good relationship with your attorney, you’re more likely to go back and enhance the plan over time.
The second topic is that beneficiaries are frustrated with their existing trustee and the distribution process is cumbersome. A trustee’s duty requires him or her to objectively follow the terms of the trust. That could include making mandatory distributions, for example if the trust requires all income to be paid to Sally annually, or $1m to be paid to Doris on her 30th birthday. More common is the discretionary decision to make distributions, where the trustee must balance the terms of the trust with the desires of the beneficiary making the ask, along with the duty to future beneficiaries who might not even be born yet. It’s a delicate balance and needs to be consistent, process-driven and be well documented. Where I see trustees getting themselves into trouble is when they listen to the loudest voice but forget their duty to other beneficiaries. When choosing a trustee, it’s important to understand what their process looks like. What information will they ask from the beneficiary, how quickly can they make a decision, how many people are in the decision making, how do they maintain consistency and avoid playing favorites, and do they have a dreaded committee that meets only monthly with approved and denied stamps. But the beneficiary also has to play his or her part. The trustee might require information from the beneficiary in order to make the right decision. A trust is not an ATM machine, so when the trustee asks for information it’s likely so they can perform their duties and not because they’re looking for reasons to deny distributions.
In addition, clients often also wonder if their trust is invested in the best way. I’m fortunate to carry out our trustee duties in a large financial institution with talented investment professionals, which certainly makes my job easier. Even the best investors would struggle to invest trust assets without really understanding the terms of the trust, its purpose, duration, and the needs of the beneficiary. By default, a trustee is held to a high standard of prudent investing. That usually means avoiding concentrations, diversifying assets, and thinking about both current and future beneficiaries. Families often create wealth with large, concentrated interests that have significantly increased in value. A trustee’s role is not to replicate that with trust assets; it’s to preserve it and grow it reasonably for the needs of the beneficiaries. A family that became wealthy in manufacturing widgets might be comfortable with 90% of their net worth being in widget factories, but a prudent trustee should not. Investing for trusts also requires a fundamental question of whom am I investing for. If a trust has an eternal duration, such as modern dynasty trusts, the trustee needs to think way beyond the current beneficiaries. That might mean that taking more risk is appropriate than for a trust that needs to cover education cost for beneficiaries currently in their early teens.
Lastly, you should consider if you have outgrown your current situation. I don’t have an Uncle Joe, but I often reference a proverbial Uncle Joe to represent a smart family member who acts with integrity and understands your values. Uncle Joe might be a great fit as a trustee in some cases. The same can be said for small, regional corporate trust companies. As you and your family’s lives get more complex, however, it’s possible that you outgrow Uncle Joe’s capacity or comfort zone. Does he really want the fiduciary risk, can he handle complex legal and tax issues, produce trust accountings, manage the trust assets, objectively decide on distributions and build a framework for recording and tracking decision making. With the best will in the world, that’s a lot for Uncle Joe. Especially if he has a day job and his own family. Even if Uncle Joe takes all of this responsibility without charging a fee, he might need to hire accountants, attorneys, investment managers which adds up to more than the fees for a corporate trustee who undertake all of these duties. Let’s say Uncle Joe doesn’t do a stellar job, despite the best intentions. Do you want your children to sue him and go after his personal assets? Choosing the right trustee is about relationships, but it’s also about choosing a trustee with the right resources, experience and commitment to carry out your estate plan effectively.
Thank you very much for listening. I hope you found this helpful. We’d welcome the opportunity to discuss how JP Morgan might be helpful in a trustee or executor capacity for your estate plan.",,,"

https://privatebank.jpmorgan.com/gl/en/insights/investing/how-to-invest-in-alternative-assets,"Investment StrategyAlternatives: Do you want to invest? Here's how to start.authors:- Mark HempsteadContact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.
Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.More and more people are now looking to add alternative investments to their portfolios—and it’s easy to see why.
It’s increasingly obvious to us that, alone, publicly traded stocks and bonds may not provide the results investors seek. At the same time, individuals are gaining greater access to private markets that help them diversify holdings and may lead to higher returns.
Unfortunately,
why
to invest in alternatives is far more obvious than
how
to invest in them. Incorporating alternatives into portfolios can be challenging for even the most experienced institutional investors.
The alternatives universe has become so broad, offering an enormous array of asset classes, styles, combinations, frameworks, models and vehicles. Indeed, there are now more than 18,000 private investment funds and 9,000+ hedge funds alone
1
—and performance can vary widely.
2
We have decades of experience helping our clients navigate the complexity of alternatives to create meaningful portfolios that help meet their goals. Here are some key ideas to help you get started.
Our recommended approach to investing in alternatives
We believe the wisest way to invest in alternatives is to:
Start by articulating the goals you have for your portfolio
Assess how much illiquidity you’re comfortable with
Plan to invest over multiple years
Build your diversified portfolio—with our assistance (or we can do it for you)
Your objectives
The first step is always to determine what job you would like the alternative investment to do for you. So, what is your objective: Portfolio diversification? Mitigating volatility? Generating higher yield? Inflation protection? Return enhancement? All of the above?
Your objectives might make the choice of alternative investments clear, as some alternatives have a distinct, primary function in a portfolio and others have multiple functions. For example, private equity may enhance returns; real estate can help reduce volatility and provide inflation protection.However, our view is that most investors are likely to benefit from a diversified alternatives portfolio (here, the sum of the parts can often be greater than the whole).
Your tolerance for illiquidity
Alternatives are by definition less liquid than public market investments; alternatives investors trade liquidity for return potential.
Unfortunately, fear of illiquidity may be keeping some from reaping the potential benefits of alternatives. They  may not realize that a private investor’s commitment is phased in over time—and returns typically come back over time. In other words, your money is not gone at all once nor completely tied up for the length of the investment.
Some private bank clients are now typically allocating 15% to 30% of their overall portfolio to alternatives. But how much might be right for you depends entirely on your goals.
For example, clients who are investing primarily for future generations and don’t need much current liquidity might allocate even more. We see some clients who allocate as much as 50% to alternatives. But others who need more flexibility, perhaps to keep investing in their business, might allocate considerably less.
Your multi-year plan
We recommend that clients diversify across all key factors. That includes sectors, geographies, managers’ skill sets—and time.
That’s right, time is a critical factor we think you should diversify. Private investments are often referred to as “vintages,” like wine. A fund that starts in 2015 and invests capital over the next three to four years would be called a “2015 vintage fund.” And just like wine, there are vintages that are better than others (investing all your capital in 2007, right before the Financial Crisis, versus starting in 2009.)
We generally recommend investors strive for an even commitment pace over four to five years and recycle capital (and potential profits) thereafter.
Your choice
We recommend starting in one of two ways:
Select opportunities from a wide set we make available
. Investors typically can pick from a range of themes they find compelling, such as technology, infrastructure, energy or healthcare. Or they choose based on geography or managers they like. We can help you identify those and work with you to reassess regularly
Invest in a diversified portfolio that we build for you
( our “model portfolio”) that allocates to a variety of underlying funds that we vet and manage. Our goal is to find the most favorable opportunities and the most suitable people investing in those opportunities
We can help
Even the most experienced investors can easily be overpowered by the array of alternative classes, strategies and vehicles now on offer. But you never have to go it alone.
Your J.P. Morgan team and our experienced alternatives specialists are here for you. We are committed to helping you ensure that your selections, no matter where they are sourced, work to help you achieve your long-term financial goals.

This democratization of information and tools provides individuals with new ways to manage finances and investments on their own.
A “private bank” is at the other end of the spectrum. A real private bank is where you should have a one-on-one relationship with an unbiased banker who can help you organize, manage and enhance your financial affairs. A private bank should offer you special access to all the classic services offered by banks and financial planners—planning, investing, borrowing and banking—all in one place. Then it should do more. Connect you to unique opportunities and people. Help you identify and reach the goals you set.
When is a “private bank” right for you?
The more money you have, the more likely you and your family would benefit from the level of service a true private bank can offer. Your finances are more complex; your opportunities and risks, potentially greater. Even if you are a sophisticated investor, you want the access and insights a good private bank should provide.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Despite a temporary slowdown in growth companies, we have strong conviction in select areas of technology.Ian Schaeffer, Global Investment Strategist
Tech stocks suffered over the past year, but that doesn’t mean the end of long-term opportunities. Exciting technological breakthroughs that may generate strong investment returns are still possible: Look at ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence (AI) language chatbot that launched in November 2022 and attracted over one billion visits just during February 2023.
1
Many (if not most) of the fast-growing disruptors we think will drive innovation in the coming years are early-stage private companies. To access such opportunities means turning to private market investing.
We believe private markets are likely to offer higher long-term returns than the public equity market benchmark, and the past few months’ tough macro environment hasn’t dimmed our excitement. Recent technical dynamics lean in private funds’ favor.
2
And we have strong a conviction in the fundamental timeliness and necessity of many emerging innovations.
Growth equity does come with risks. Return dispersion among fund managers should rise, as loss ratios likely do. Plus, growth investing inherently comes with a higher loss ratio than the broad equity markets.
The six areas of growth and innovation in which we have the strongest conviction are
artificial intelligence (AI), automation and robotics, cybersecurity, ecommerce, cloud software
and
electrification
. Here’s why—and some best use cases, starting with those lately generating the most interest:
1. Artificial intelligence: With recent advances, poised for a surge in investment
AI’s science and engineering have the potential to spur massive change in how many industries, professions—indeed how we all—carry out daily tasks. Virtual assistants and chatbots can already reply to written queries with language that seems eerily human. AI’s real impact, though, will be felt over the long term. ChatGPT’s generative AI (AI trained on a vast dataset that can respond to user inputs with creative new text, images and other media) should particularly impact our daily lives.
Industry leaders using these breakthroughs have already launched more accurate iterations with greater sensitivity to users’ tones and contexts, and the ability to respond to images. This allows generative AI to describe visual environments in real time. For example, a mobile app that helps visually impaired people is unveiling an AI-powered tool that can take a photo someone uploads of the contents of their refrigerator, and tell the user what’s there and dinner recipes using those ingredients. The steady cadence of innovation helped investment in AI to rise sharply in 2021.AI aligns closely with reshoring (of offshore facilities) and deglobalization. Companies moving plants closer to home may turn to AI to ease higher labor costs. That could help drive a surge in private sector AI investment in the coming years.
Additional AI use cases include:
Medicine—To help read radiological imaging to detect diseases
Consumer applications—For real-time pricing of goods and services (such as ride hailing)
Drug discovery—To aid pharmaceutical companies in combing through vast datasets
2. Automation and robotics: Critical for companies to remain competitive
Meanwhile, amid today’s tight U.S. labor market, companies have a pressing need to improve efficiency and reduce the time staff spend on redundant tasks. Like AI, automation
3
technologies may come to the rescue. Global automation and robotics markets are projected to quadruple in size from 2023 to 2030, from about $39 billion to $160 billion.
4
Advanced automation and robotics are also related to “smart security,” an investing area that’s come to the fore since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
5
Defense companies producing advanced drones (and other autonomous surveillance technologies) consider it a priority. Many manufacturers have already deployed advanced automation as part of these devices.
Other use cases for automation and robotics include:
Mining and manufacturing—To handle dangerous materials and processes
Supply chain automation—For simple tasks such as physical delivery
Restaurants and dining—To take orders and bring out food
Security automation—With software playing an increasingly important role in conflicts, security and physical defense automation will likely become critical
3. Cybersecurity: Anticipating continued demand as threats multiply
Cybersecurity
6
has become crucial to defending government, corporate and even consumers’ infrastructure, particularly now that cloud computing offers bad actors an even greater attack surface to infiltrate.
Cybersecurity also enables all the technological advancements we’ve described. Without it, companies couldn’t invent or invest in innovation, and governments could not keep secrets.
That it is so essential helps explain why the value of cybersecurity private equity (PE) deals appeared to remain relatively resilient during the volatile market environment of 2022. Cybersecurity deals in the first three quarters of 2022 roughly equaled all of 2021.
7
Cybersecurity use cases include:
Tech, financial and other firms—To enhance cyber defense, facilitate remote work particularly in the cloud, and to allow safe storage, secure management and easy retrieval of sensitive data
Social media companies—To safeguard online users’ data
Energy companies—To protect critical infrastructure
4. E-commerce: Declining valuations may offer an attractive entry point
E-commerce has increasingly permeated our lives. Of course, the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated its growth as a percentage of retail sales, and the trend is likely to continue rising.
Like PE, venture capital (VC) funding flows into e-commerce were relatively resilient during a tough year: Median and average valuations of VC firms’ holdings in late-stage, e-commerce startups climbed in 2022, even after surging in 2021. Recently, some signs point to a decline in these extraordinarily high valuations, which could open the door for new investors seeking an attractive entry point.
Promising e-commerce use cases include:
Traditional businesses—For transitioning to a hybrid model (brick-and-mortar and online sales), opening new marketplaces
Social media—To provide a livestreaming platform for influencers promoting and selling goods and services
Commerce—For business-to-consumer, business-to-business and consumer-to-consumer transactions
5. Cloud software: Corporate storage, analytics may propel growth
The use of cloud software
8
has become ubiquitous across industries and central to how many large enterprises function. (Some cloud applications also target and serve consumers.) The global cloud computing market is expected to grow rapidly—from under $500 billion today to almost $1.4 trillion by 2030.
9
Use cases in which we have strong conviction include:
Data storage and access—To allow corporations, individuals and social media platforms to store files (including vast photo and video files) and collaborate from any device, anywhere
Analytics—To analyze data stored on cloud platforms for business insights
Crisis resiliency—For backup strategies to store and recover critical files in an emergency
6. Electrification: Energy storage and battery recycling could be key
The transition to renewable energy will require decades of innovation across industries. Electrifying transportation will likely be key. The rising popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) has produced an urgent need for battery (and parts) recycling—a new circular supply chain.
We see promise in several companies pioneering recycling processes and technologies, and forging partnerships across EV and energy storage industries, since collection will be a costly challenge. Also exciting is remanufacturing lithium-ion batteries using recycled content.
Partnerships with automakers will be important to achieve economies of scale and create a robust closed-loop battery ecosystem. In the future, we anticipate an industry that will help solve environmental challenges and unlock a new source of raw materials at a time of material shortages.
10
Electrification use cases include:
Properties—For lower-emission electricity to power appliances (e.g., heat pumps) in place of natural gas
Mass transit—The electrification of public transport
Semiconductors and other component makers—Sales should rise for manufacturers of solar panels, wind turbines and other infrastructure crucial to the energy transition
Recycling—To reduce pollution and increase supply of rare, critical materials during the energy transition
Where does growth fit into your portfolio?
Your allocation to growth will vary based on your risk tolerance. We generally think many investors should maintain a 10%–20% allocation to growth within the venture capital portion of their portfolios in order to access long-term growth opportunities that may not be available in public markets.
Notable risks of growth equity investing include managers’ return dispersion (which is dramatic compared to the broad market) and a higher loss ratio than other investments. With the
end of the easy money era
, we expect loss ratios
11
to normalize around 15%–20%.
VC funding for technology has retreated to pre-pandemic levels after an unusual period in 2021 when deals and valuations soared. This decline isn’t unexpected because of tight financial conditions, and since private markets typically follow public market downturns, with a lag.An economic slowdown may help identify the best managers. More competitive dynamics, in the absence of easy money, tend to favor more tenured growth investors with experience picking winning companies in different economic environments. Indeed, recent history has shown that funds with experienced managers tend to retain their values during volatile markets, while newer managers have seen their aggregate fund values fall.
As conditions tighten, managers will also become more selective, and VC firms should have the power to negotiate better deals with companies that need cash, even with higher funding costs.In sum, we think this is an attractive entry point—particularly with experienced managers—into the private market, as well as early-stage growth and innovation.
If you’d like to discuss your portfolio’s allocation to growth and whether you have the right level of exposure to innovation, ask your J.P. Morgan team about the growth managers on our platform whose niche specialties target various sectors, stages and areas of innovation.1

The loss ratio is the ratio of the number of investments that end up going toward defaulted deals (worth zero) relative to the total number of investments made in a fund.This chart shows annual investment in artificial intelligence by companies from 2013 through 2021. The data is shown for the globe, with specific regions, including the United States, China and the European Union, also shown. The world data began in 2013 at 3 billion dollars invested, then gradually climbed to reach 48 billion dollars in 2020. Global investment in artificial intelligence then spiked to 93.5 billion dollars in 2021. For the United States, investment in AI stood at 2 billion dollars in 2013 and gradually climbed each year to reach 52.8 billion dollars in 2021. For the European Union, investment in AI in 2013 was 0.55 billion dollars and gradually climbed each year to reach 2.1 billion dollars in 2020. Investment then spiked to 6.4 billion dollars in 2021. For China, AI investment in 2013 stood at 0.15 billion dollars in 2013 and then steadily climbed until 2019 to reach 13.5 billion dollars. Investment then dropped in 2020 to 10 billion dollars, before rebounding in 2021 to reach 17.2 billion dollars.This chart shows venture capital technology deals by count and dollar value on a quarterly basis from Q1 2012 through Q4 2022. In Q1 2012, the deal value for VC tech deals stood at 8 billion dollars. The value of deals gradually climbed to reach 24 billion dollars in Q2 2016 before sharply falling to 14 billion in Q4 2016. The value of deals then steadily climbed again to reach 30 billion dollars in Q3 2018 and 44 billion dollars in Q4 2018. The value of deals between Q1 2019 through Q2 2020 stayed relatively consistent at around 30 billion dollars. The value then spiked to 84 billion dollars in Q4 2021 before falling through 2022 to fall to 66 in Q2 2022 and 30 billion dollars in Q4 2022. In terms of the number of deals, the number of deals in Q1 2012 was 1,732. This number very gradually rose to reach 3,050 in Q4 2020. The number of deals surged higher across 2021 to peak at 4,264 in Q1 2022 before falling for the remaining quarters of the dataset to hit 2,413 in Q4 2022.This chart shows the fund value of U.S. venture capital funds from 2013 through 2022 on an annual basis. The data is shown in two categories based on the experience level of fund managers: (1) the “emerging” category is firms that have fewer than four funds launched; and (2) the “experienced” category includes firms that have launched four or more funds. The emerging category fund value was 10.16 billion dollars in 2013. This figure gradually climbed until 2021, when it reached a peak of 54.34 billion dollars. Emerging fund value then dropped sharply to fall to 34.38 billion in 2022. Experienced funds started in 2013 at 12.27 billion dollars. This figure climbed consistently, and generally more quickly than that of the emerging fund category, through the entire dataset. The one exception was a slight drop from 2016 to 2017. By 2021, experienced fund value reached 99.80 billion dollars and peaked in 2022 at 128.27 billion dollars.Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.CIO Richard Madigan assesses the current state of the economy and markets—and shares how we are positioning portfolios now.Market Thoughts: A glimmer of hope
Central banks continue to reinforce their commitment to taming inflation. They can’t afford to sound dovish; they don’t want markets melting up. Doing their job gets harder ahead.
Markets reflect a softish landing, a hard landing is not priced in. While a hard landing isn’t our base case, it’s not a zero probability. It isn’t time to be chasing after markets.
Investors are looking through higher policy rates. We’re close to central banks readying to pause rate hikes. We still have quantitative tightening to get through.
Policymakers are attempting to slow demand, and by extension growth, to regain control of still too high inflation. It’s working.
A glimmer of hope
is the narrative currently seized by markets. We continue to see positive news both on inflation as it trends lower and global growth, which remains better than feared. That’s good news for the soft landing crowd, bad news for recessionists.
China’s move away from zero-Covid is adding to confidence. Their reopening lends support to global growth, which continues to slow. It’s constructive for Asia from an economic perspective. It’s also beneficial for global trading partners as well as multinationals that source demand from the region.
A reawakened China makes the job of central banks a bit more challenging. They’re ramping up demand, with commodity markets the first to react. That may keep headline inflation higher for longer than policymakers like. The re-opening of supply chains can help balance out that reflationary pulse, specifically as it relates to global input costs and trade.
With labor markets and wages stable, consumption will likely see support from lower inflationary pressure and savings rates returning to trend (Figure 1). While excess pandemic savings are being spent down, they’re at levels that remain supportive of a slowing, not breaking, economic backdrop.“I want to take you higher”
is the song playing in the background for central banks as they push rates higher. Their challenge remains guidance about what comes next. Both the Federal Reserve (Fed) and European Central Bank (ECB) continue to reinforce their commitment to taming inflation. They also need to acknowledge inflation is moving in the right direction without sounding dovish. They don’t want markets melting up.
In a January interview, Larry Summers emphasized policymakers need to maintain maximum flexibility. The phrase he used I found particularly grounding was to acknowledge central banks are “driving on a very, very foggy night.” I couldn’t agree more; they still are.
I continue to take both the Fed and ECB at their word. I’m anchoring on a terminal policy rate target for the Fed of around 5-5.25% by the end of the second-quarter. For the ECB, those numbers are 3-3.25% (Figure 2). Each central bank will continue to maximize policy optionality. Doing their job gets harder from here. Policymakers will soon pause rate hikes. That doesn’t mean they’re done hiking.The fact that the difference between 10-year and 3-month U.S. government bond yields turned negative last October was noteworthy. I keep a close eye on that part of the bond curve to signal increasing market concern of recession. So does the Fed.
Term structure inversion has only deepened since. The tea leaf reading of that inversion falls squarely under the umbrella of choose your own adventure. Investors remain spilt on whether it’s signaling good or bad news. That tug of war is likely to continue.
For optimists, bond curve inversion indicates a Fed artfully walking the line of tightening policy rates while avoiding a hard landing. I share that view as a base case. It feeds into why we are neutral equities. Also, why we hold positions in high yield and investment grade credit.
If the U.S. Treasury curve inverts further, markets will likely anticipate the Fed is pushing the economy into a hard landing. While the difference between 10-year and 3-month interest rates may be the best predictor of a recession, historically it has told us very little about how soon a recession will happen or how severe it will be.
On average (note my qualifier), once term structure inverts a recession tends to follow about a year later. The size of the inversion provides an indication of how worried investors are about the economic outlook. It’s a good read on sentiment but its neither predictive of the severity of a recession, nor as important as the inversion itself.
A failure to communicate.
“What we’ve got here is failure to communicate.” That line is from the movie
Cool Hand Luke
. It was said by Captain as Luke is given a hiding. I thought of it as I continue to watch investors battle the Fed and ECB on their “we’re all in” on tightening narrative. The key question… is the market Luke or Captain?
“Don’t fight the Fed” is a truism on Wall Street. And yet, the reality is an artful central bank wants the market to do the heavy lifting for it, especially when it comes to rate hikes. Investors are having none of it, they’re pushing back.
Markets want to be done with last year, quickly moving on to a more normal environment. “Buy the dip” was fun and simple, especially with easy money acting as the foundation for risk taking. Easy money is over. The cost of capital is rising and in my mind, risk premia don’t reflect the challenges ahead.
That is unless you believe the Fed is getting ready to pause
and
that they will cut rates this year. Investors hope the Fed believes—as they reach +5% on policy rates in the coming months—they’ve overshot. Maybe, but labor market strength and lessons learned from the 1970s give them the impetus to hike further. Then, to hold policy rates higher for longer. Hope is never a good investment strategy.
Valuations across risk assets reflect a softish landing. A hard landing isn’t in current market pricing. And while a hard landing isn’t our base case, it’s not a zero probability. That leaves us not wanting to over-reach for risk. Markets have run fast and furious, we’re due a breather.
Ultimately, a market is worth what someone is willing to pay for it. With some of the worst fears coming into this year ostensibly abating, investors are hungry to embrace risk. I chalk that up to human nature. Greed may be good, but it can prove short-lived.
I’m looking through you.
The Beatles’ “I’m looking through you” is the current market theme song. If there’s a surprise ahead it may be that the current inflation, tightening and risk asset repricing cycles run longer than imagined, not breaking the global economy. We seem to be heading in that direction.
Markets, reinvigorated by risk-on sentiment, are looking past higher policy rates. The basic view is we’re closer to central banks being done with raising rates. Improvements in supply chain bottlenecks, a continued decline in both headline and core inflation and a slowdown in housing, retail sales and production are contributing to the feel good sentiment.
It’s interesting to watch the push and pull on sentiment. As it relates to central banks having to pivot sooner, we’ve gone from bad news being good news to bad news being bad. Inflation continues to roll over. That should only accelerate as the lag in rents and housing begin to weigh more directly on the pace of disinflation. That’s good news.
The bad news? Investors are rightfully reacting cautiously to falling growth. In the current environment, you can’t have disinflation without a decline in growth, as well as weaker wages and labor markets. Central banks are attempting to slow demand, and by extension growth, to regain control of inflation. It’s working. Hopefully what we’re seeing doesn’t prove to be transitory disinflation. Markets suffered enough last year at the hands of transitory inflation.
Slower economic growth begets slower top-line revenue growth. Margins in the U.S. remain above long-term trend levels (Figure 3). I expect we will see margins mean revert, moving lower. Layoffs are likely to continue. In aggregate, they’ve not yet been alarming. As headlines, they make for bad news.Staying the course.
I’d characterize the earnings season we’ve just come through as good enough for equity markets to remain supported. That said, valuations in the U.S. are moving farther away from concern of recession. U.S. equity markets may be well below peak, but they’re not cheap.
We’ve been adding to European equities, funded from the U.S. I view that shift as defensive repositioning with upside. Europe is attractively valued both to its own history as well as relative to the U.S. In a broad market pullback, I expect Europe’s lower valuation to provide lower down-capture relative to the U.S. Should the global economy continue to surprise positively, Europe offers an opportunity for further re-rating.
European top-line and earnings growth are outperforming U.S. companies. Sectors in Europe we are focusing on include consumer discretionary, specifically luxury where consensus still seems to be underestimating earnings growth thanks to China’s reopening. In addition, we favor consumer staples with a focus on beverages. European banks continue to surprise positively as well.
We retain an overweight in portfolios to extended and investment grade credit, including European companies. We added to longer maturity bonds last year as rates pressed higher. We’re currently neutral duration. With yields higher, bonds can again serve as a diversifier of portfolio risk. They’re also adding carry, via higher interest rates.
I want to ensure portfolios are in a position that allows us to stay in the game if markets continue to press higher. Should we see a sell-off, we’ll quickly pivot, leaning into the pockets hardest hit. We’re staying the course in the overall level of risk we’re taking. We’ll undoubtedly see opportunities ahead, we always do. They tend to appear when least expected.
INDEX DEFINITIONS
The S&P 500® is widely regarded as the best single gauge of large-cap U.S. equities. The index includes 500 leading companies and covers approximately 80% of available market capitalization.
The MSCI Europe Index captures large and mid cap representation across 15 Developed Markets (DM) countries in Europe. With 426 constituents as of December 2022, the index covers approximately 85% of the free float-adjusted market capitalization across the European Developed Markets equity universe.
The MSCI Japan Index is designed to measure the performance of the large and mid cap segments of the Japanese market. With 237 constituents as of December 2022, the index covers approximately 85% of the free float-adjusted market capitalization in Japan.
Indices are not investment products and may not be considered for investment.Line chart of Advanced Economies (AE) headline and core consumer price indices (CPI) shown on a year-over-year (yoy) percentage change basis (y-axis) through December 2022. Monthly data points are displayed since 2011 (x-axis). Headline and core CPI are calculated by averaging the relevant CPIs of 22 advanced economies, weighted by each country's share of total nominal GDP in 2015. Prior to 2021, core inflation as shown was hovering around or below 2%; but starting in 2021, a marked inflation increase occurred, with both headline CPI reaching a high of 8% and core CPI at around 5% in October 2022. However, over most recent couple of months both headline and core CPI declined from peak levels, which may indicate a downward inflation trajectory.Line chart of U.S. and Euro area central bank policy rates since 2011 through February 2023. Policy rates for the euro area hovered around or below 0% for the better part of the time period shown except for starting in late 2022, where policy rates began increasing markedly to 2.5% most recently. In the U.S., policy rates were around 0% from 2011 to 2016, increased to almost 2.5% by mid-2019, and returned to 0% from 2020 to 2021. Similarly, starting in 2022, U.S. policy rates began to increase significantly – reaching slightly above 4.5% most recently.Line chart of S&P 500, MSCI Europe and MSCI Japan trailing twelve month net income margins time series shown in percentage terms on the y-axis and displayed on a quarterly basis since 2003 through Q4 2022 on the x-axis. While divergent in level terms with the S&P 500 highest at around 13.5% in Q1 of 2022 and Japan at below 7%, all regions show significant margin growth from 2020 levels, most notably in Europe which increased by over 5% to almost 11%. However, in the most recent few quarters the chart portrays a modest decline in margins. Still, though, margins remain elevated relative to history as shown across regions. The chart denotes that past performance is not indicative of future returns, and that it is not possible to invest in an index.Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Taking advantage of the highest yields in a decade was smart,  but long term, being underweight equities could hurt your chances of meeting your goalsDid you shift some capital to short-term fixed income, to take advantage of a historical yield opportunity?
Many people did. In this period of heightened market volatility and consecutive Federal Reserve rate hikes, adding to short-term fixed income holdings made sense.
1
But pan out to a long-term perspective and it has been a different story.
A portfolio that relies too heavily on fixed income can limit your ability to grow your capital over time, and could keep you from meeting your most essential goals. For example, someone who invested just in Treasury bills (maturing in less than one year) for the last 30 years would have barely preserved their purchasing power.
Fixed income is not historically a source of long-term growth—it just about allows an investor to keep up with inflation, which is still running high at about 5%
.
2
Without enough equities, history tells us, your portfolio lacks a growth engine. Not enough growth means possibly hindering your ability to meet your long-term return objectives. That could force you to take more risk later on, or force you to lower your lifetime financial goals.
That’s why we believe if you overweighted your fixed income allocation at the expense of equities, it may be a time for a rethink.
Equities fuel a core portfolio’s long-term growth
To grow your wealth over time, fixed income is not a substitute for equities. Your “core” portfolio— typically stocks and bonds—is designed to meet your lifelong needs (a traditional core is often a 60/40 stock-bond mix but yours may look different, based on your risk appetite and objectives). In that 60/40 portfolio, for example, two-thirds of returns historically have come from the equity portion.
3For 25 years, our annual forecasts for long-term investment returns have helped guide our investors’ core portfolios. In the 27th annual edition of our Long-Term Capital Market Assumptions (LTCMAs), published in November 2022, we forecast a sharp rise in long-term stock and bond market returns, the best we’ve forecast since 2010
.
4
Plus, we believe valuation declines in stocks in 2022 have created an attractive entry point in 2023 to help build the equity side of portfolios.
How we define a core portfolio: 3 things it needs
We believe that a good core portfolio needs to include equities, your growth engine, and fixed income, your stability, so it can serve as an anchor to meet your long-term goals. Your core portfolio should be three things:
reliable, rebalanced,
and
always fully invested
. Here’s why.
1
. Reliable.
We believe the historical performance of 60/40 portfolios can give investors long-term confidence
It is difficult (if not impossible) to predict the direction of markets on any given day, week or month. But as you extend to multiple years or decades, historical evidence suggests market forecasts can be made with a degree of confidence. Economic cycles have come and gone but historically, economic growth has trended upward over the long-term, lifting the value of equities.
As shown in the chart below, the annualized return of a 60/40 stock-bond allocation, for example, has outperformed cash during every rolling 20-year period since 1975. The future is unknowable, of course, but this historical “beta” (market performance unaided by manager actions or “alpha”) underlies our confidence in well-constructed, diversified multi-asset core portfolios.In the worst 20-year period for a 60/40 portfolio, when it returned 4.3% annualized, it still outperformed (the average) cash return. Eighty percent of the time, 20-year rolling annualized returns for a 60/40 were between 5.7% and 12.5%. Eighty percent of the time, returns of a 60/40 portfolio over cash were between 3.3% and 5.6%.
2
.
Disciplined
rebalancing
is important to manage “drift” in your core portfolio’s asset allocations.
In addition to adding 20 bps to your average return, rebalancing is important because it potentially reduces risk, meaningfully. Rebalancing a 60/40 portfolio has minimized annual volatility by 90 basis points, on average historically.
5
Consider
:
The equity portion of a 60/40, without rebalancing, would have grown from 60% in 1993 to 80% in 2021 because of the equities’ relatively larger appreciation. That overweighting would have made for an even more painful 2022, especially if you were expecting your risk was well balanced.
5
3. Trying to time the market, rather than
staying fully invested
, will likely cost you.
Based on our LTCMAs, for every year you aren’t fully invested in a traditional 60/40 core portfolio (and sit in cash instead), you’ll likely receive about 3% to 4% less in returns than if you had been fully invested.
6
Staying invested may be uncomfortable sometimes, but we think it’s how to be best positioned to reach your long-term goals.
What makes a good core portfolio
Once your long-term core portfolio is reliable, rebalanced and fully invested, it’s meeting the job description. But most of us want to level up. So here’s a checklist for getting your core portfolio to work harder for you and potentially deliver even more:
Make it tax sensitive
: For taxable clients, core portfolios should be managed with tax efficiency as a priority. Systematically and actively doing something called
tax loss harvesting
can provide a silver lining when markets are down and allow you take losses in your portfolio, potentially turning them into a tax benefit and off-setting gains made elsewhere in your investments.
Using a tax loss harvesting strategy for equities could potentially add 100 to 150 basis points of tax alpha to your equity returns.
7
Make sure it’s cost efficient
: Core portfolios should be thoughtful about preserving returns. Seeking to utilize low-cost investment vehicles for implementation, within your broader investment portfolio, can prevent underlying fees from eating away at your returns every year.
Customize:
A core portfolio is not one-size-fits-all. It can incorporate your preferences around risk tolerance, implementation, geographical regions and more (perhaps you want to include alternatives such as hedge funds, for example).
Allow tactical adjustments, for the opportunity to earn more
: Active managers can seek to add alpha (returns exceeding the market index) by finding and seizing opportunities as they arise, and tactically adjust the core portfolio accordingly.
If you’ve drifted too far toward fixed income, remember that your core portfolio is designed for long-term growth. Equities will likely play a crucial role in driving that growth. Consider adding the elements that make a core truly great (tax efficiency, cost efficiency, customization and the opportunity for alpha) and you will likely be in a better position to meet your long-term goals.

The line chart shows the growth of $100 through the period for all aforementioned data sets. Both the 1-3 Month Treasury Bills and Headline Inflation are growing at a more stagnant rate relative to the other 3 data sets included; only reaching ~$200 in 2023. The U.S. Aggregate Bond Index grows at a fast rate than both 1-3 Month Treasury Bills and Headline Inflation reaching a level of ~$400, however, the MSCI World Index (~$900 in 2023) and the 60/40 Multi-Asset Portfolio (~$700 in 2023) have grown at a much faster rate vs. other indices listed despite peaking in the latter half of 2021. At their peak in 2021 , the MSCI World and 60/40 Multi-Asset Portfolio were up ~$1000 and ~$800, respectively. Finally, although the MSCI World Index and 60/40 Multi-Asset Portfolio drew down through most of 2022, there has been a reversal in 2023 through March, indicated by an upward trajectory for both the MSCI World Index and 60/40 Multi-Asset Portfolio.Stacked column chart showing the range of 20 year rolling returns in percentage terms on the y-axis with two columns on the x-axis.

Some others like to think beyond that. For most people, though, multigenerational estate planning raises important questions around objectives and assets: Should wealth be used for specific purposes only, such as education or entrepreneurial projects? What about emergencies? How to draw an effective plan without even knowing how many descendants there will be in the future? What does it take to ensure wealth can be sustained beyond the next generation?

Felicia:
Welcome to the newest episode of the Life & Legacy Podcast Series. My name is Felicia Law, and I am based in Hong Kong running the North Asia Wealth Advisory Team for the Private Bank. Today, with my colleague Daniel Fleming, a Senior Wealth Advisor based in Geneva, Switzerland, covering our clients in the Middle East and Turkey, we will be discussing issues to consider when setting aside assets for future generations beyond the next. Hi, Daniel!
Daniel:
Hi, Felicia, and thank you all for joining this podcast! In previous episodes of this series, our Wealth Advisory colleagues discussed topics covering when families should start thinking about putting in place an estate plan, and how does one go about doing that, and this very much focused on the very next generation. What about generations beyond that? What sort of planning could be done to ensure wealth can be sustained beyond the next generation?
Felicia:
Yes, this is indeed a great topic! I once had a client who shared with me that “
this is too complicated. Let’s focus on my children and let them deal with the rest. I am confident that they know what’s best for their own children.
”
That’s certainly one way of looking at it! However, what if after his passing, one of his children goes through a nasty divorce and ends up losing half of what she inherited to her ex-husband? Would she still have enough to adequately provide for her children and grandchildren? Wouldn’t it be better if some assets were left in a perpetual fund, just in case a family member loses their inherited wealth due to unexpected events?
Daniel:
I’ve had the same type of conversations! However, for those that do commit to plan for generations beyond the next, I find that they put in much more thought and passion in providing for their grandchildren and beyond in comparison to how they approach planning for the very next generation. Perhaps this is because in most cultures the transfer of wealth to the next generation is expected, whereas it is not at the level of grandchildren, and thus there is a real sense of gifting to beneficiaries not expecting anything at all!
Felicia
: That’s absolutely true, Daniel! So how could we help those clients that want to plan beyond the next generation?
Daniel:
First of all, it is important for the client to try and define his/her objectives and answer as best as possible the following simple questions:
·         In what way do you want to assist future generations? Is it for education, health and entrepreneurship? Emergencies?
·         Should certain criteria or rules be applicable in order for future generation family members to benefit?
·         How far down the generations does he/she want to provide for?
Felicia:
…and answering those questions will drive how much he/she should set aside for this!
Daniel:
I was hoping you were going to say that! It is very much a “chicken and egg” situation. Does defining the objectives first define the amount that you want to set aside, or does defining the size first give you a better way to focus on clear objectives? To be frank, there is no right answer as to which end to tackle first.
Felicia:
Yes, I agree!
One question that I often get asked by clients is: “How do you plan if you don’t even know how many descendants there will be in the future?” We certainly do not have a crystal ball that gives us the answer to this question. But I imagine that we as Wealth Advisors are naturally going to get the client to speak about objectives first, and then ask the “how much” question after. Following that, we can go through some financial projections with the client so that he/she can decide whether he/she needs to top up the pot or dial down the objectives.
Daniel:
And these financial projections will not just include outflows to beneficiaries, but will also take into consideration investment returns. The investment profile will need to be considered carefully, and it will change over time. I imagine that at the beginning, the focus will be more on growing the initial pot, and as time goes by and as we get into the future generations, the focus will be more around producing steady income.
Felicia:
So, Daniel, let’s discuss one of the potential objectives the client might want to meet for future generations. Let’s pick a straightforward one like “education.” Can it simply be “to pay for all the education for my descendants until the money runs out?” Or should there be some rules/criteria?
Daniel:
I think there should be some rules to keep it fair and sustainable. The term “education” needs to be defined, for example. We mostly see funding for university or post–high school education as the primary focus.
Felicia:
And I guess we want to avoid the serial student!
Daniel:
Yes, and I would even go as far as capping the contribution as a percentage of total tuition fees, and having the remainder paid by the parents, who themselves would have benefited from the same education fund. This puts a little pressure on both the student and the parent.
Felicia:
That is a very interesting way to look at it. Wouldn’t some of the family members view this as unfair? There could be a huge disparity between different schools when it comes to tuition.
Daniel:
It is true that there may be some inequalities in monetary terms, but the opportunity to benefit is the same for everyone.
Felicia:
I remember a family that had four children in the third generation. One of them left school at the age of 15 to start his own business, and his startup was doing really well. Another one is visually impaired. The remaining two are twins and they were both accepted into Harvard Business School. The younger twin earned a full scholarship, so all her tuition fees were paid for. This is just one example to highlight that each child is different:
·         What the first child really needs might be seed capital for his next startup.
·         The second child may need more support on top of funds to pay for tuition fees.
·         The older twin may need to draw more funds to pay for tuition fees at Harvard Business School.
It is important that families recognize this and take this into consideration when planning for future generations. For this family, I worked with the family’s legal counsel on the design of an education fund, an entrepreneurial fund, a special needs fund and an emergency fund. For each fund, the working group drafted very detailed terms of reference, setting out guidelines and circumstances where the advisory committee should exercise discretion in utilizing the assets and income generated from those assets to support the family. The members of the advisory committee are also carefully chosen to ensure that each branch of the family participates in the decision-making process.
Daniel:
Indeed! The establishment of these sub-funds encourages certain behavior amongst the family members. Some even set up charitable foundations to encourage family members to think about how to give back to the society and to leave a legacy for the whole family. Another example would be the entrepreneurial fund that encourages future generations to start their own business.
Felicia:
This is so true. I also remember working with a patriarch who wants to encourage all his descendants to have more children. He set aside a special “new baby fund” in his family trust, and each time a family gave birth to a child, he/she would receive a cash reward of US$1 million.
Daniel:
I don’t know how effective this incentive scheme has been, but this is certainly an interesting one. Felicia, let me ask you this question: “What if we got this wrong?” How do we deal with a situation where a family needs to recalibrate either the amounts or the objectives?
Felicia:
Families do this all the time. The key is to ensure that whatever system or framework that families put in place are flexible enough to allow adjustments to be made. In fact, I often remind our clients to conduct regular reviews to gather the most up-to-date information about the family, track usage of funds, revisit or challenge assumptions that were used in calculating the portions allocated to each sub-funds, and make appropriate adjustments to ensure the family’s objectives are met.
Daniel:
I cannot agree more. Flexibility is key, and planning is certainly a continuing process.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Specialty assets, such as private businesses, real estate and/or mineral asset holdings, are distinctive, complex and emotionally laden, and deserve extra care and consideration in your trust and estate planning.Unique assets privately owned by you—private businesses, real estate and/or mineral asset holdings for example—may have a special place in your heart as well as your portfolio.
Think about that property you bought years ago—the oil, gas or other mineral assets that have been in your family for generations or the family business or private partnerships you have nurtured through good times and bad.
We refer to these as “specialty assets” because they are distinct from the more broadly held stocks, bonds and other financial assets in your portfolio. Their unique and complex nature requires specialized skill and attention to ensure they accomplish the wealth goals you have set for them.
These assets often require ongoing management, day-to-day administration, continuous monitoring, risk mitigation and capital improvements. Active, informed decision making drives their growth and protects their value. Such decision making relies on an intimate knowledge of the individual business or asset, as well as the developments (economic, regulatory, tax, environmental and more, at the macro, industry, regional and community levels) that can enhance or detract from the contributions of these assets to your wealth and that of your beneficiaries.
Specialty assets—distinctive, complex and emotionally laden—deserve extra care and consideration in your trust and estate planning.
What kind of plan do you have in place for your specialty assets?
Do you have the right successors to manage and protect the long-term value of your specialty assets—in line with your financial planning and wealth transfer objectives?
Perhaps you have been managing the family business and looking after these non-financial assets with great success for years.  But who will assume those responsibilities if you choose to step back or are no longer at the helm? Does the next generation aspire to this responsibility; is it prepared? Are you confident there will be a smooth transition with minimal conflict among beneficiaries—or is there potential for disruptive family dynamics?
These assets often come with extraordinary challenges that last beyond any one generation. That’s why many owners of such unique assets provide for their management and transition of ownership through a trust administered by corporate fiduciaries.
Servicing specialty assets requires a highly specialized team
Specialty assets require a level of experience, knowledge and resources that no one individual trustee or executor can possess. You need a trusted corporate fiduciary and asset manager supported by a team of seasoned professionals that includes specialists with deep expertise. The right team is one positioned not merely to estimate and track the value of these assets, but also to help with hands-on management, structure a long-term plan, and work with you to protect and potentially enhance their value—in line with your goals and across generations.
The following case studies are drawn from the experiences of our own specialty assets teams, a dedicated part of the corporate trust and estate services we provide. Examples highlight different specialty assets, the challenges that accompanied them and what we did to help achieve our clients’ desired outcomes.
Real estate: Resolving a longstanding, complex issue
J.P. Morgan served as a co-executor for a multimillion-dollar estate with an existing trust that subsequently funded six continuing trusts for the benefit of family members, with J.P. Morgan as co-trustee. The estate contained significant real property assets, including more than 12 parcels of vacant land.
Challenge:
One sizeable property had been contaminated by a gasoline spill prior to J.P. Morgan’s involvement, an issue which would impact the sale, transfer or retention of the property.
Resolution:
Our Real Property Assets Management Team worked for more than two decades with a state Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) as well as consultants and contractors to remediate the environmental issues. Upon obtaining DEP clearance, the team marketed the property and, by addressing the potential buyer’s perception of possible residual risks with the contaminated property, sold the property at a premium in excess of the appraised value.
Mineral assets: Maintaining and enhancing value
A family with a ranching legacy dating back to the mid-19th century amassed a 400,000 acre estate that contained mineral interests. The family engaged J.P. Morgan’s Mineral Asset Management Team to manage and preserve these specialty assets.
Challenge:
The family's wish was to maximize the value of these mineral interests while ensuring they were part of their legacy plan.
Resolution:
Our Mineral Asset Management Team used its experience and market knowledge to evaluate trends and leverage the concentrated ownership of these mineral assets to increase negotiation capabilities. This resulted in favorable terms, and a windfall of lease bonus income and subsequent flows of royalty revenues. To this day, J.P. Morgan continues to manage this legacy, working closely with the co-trustee and beneficiaries to secure this wealth engine for future generations.
Private business interests: Educating the next generation
J.P. Morgan served as trustee of several trusts that owned a portion of a well-known vacation resort business based in the United States, an asset that had been transferred into the trusts by the company’s founder for the benefit of his children and grandchildren.
Challenge:
When the grantor died, one of the second-generation siblings assumed management responsibility of the vacation resort business. It was important to maintain family harmony while helping to ensure the long-term success of the enterprise.
Resolution:
Our Closely Held Asset Management Team helped educate the sibling who was not involved in the management of the business and also the next generation. The team regularly presented detailed performance updates and recommendations on the business to the beneficiaries. This knowledgeable, objective view and high level of transparency helped assure all beneficiaries that the business was being managed with utmost care and with their best interests in mind.

Stewardship can be expressed in many ways…and its meaning will vary from one family to another. The concept of stewardship can evolve over time and, of course, within a family there are often different approaches, expectations and behaviors.
So, Alfonso, let’s begin with some of your observations: how do families approach stewardship?
Alfonso
: What stewardship means to a particular stakeholder is to a great extent defined by who they are.  Think about the different types of stakeholders in a family’s enterprise or who participate in the family’s wealth.  You may have one who is a leader and may be the CEO or CFO, vested economically and also having dedicated his professional life to the enterprise or the management of the family´s wealth. On the other side of the spectrum you may have a passive investor, for whom the family enterprise is simply another investment and who may see the enterprise or the wealth held jointly with other family members as just another asset of a larger portfolio. All stakeholders will be vested in the business, or in the wealth the family may hold jointly, quite differently.  Professionally, emotionally, and even financially.   And these factors will shape how they see the role they play, what are they stewards of.
MT
: Absolutely, and of course we’re talking about people here -- full of emotions, beliefs, worries, doubts, instincts, dreams, goals and so forth.  Also, the next generation may have radically different aspirations than those their parents had.  Understanding this is essential for families to effectively help shape the habits and discipline to make the next generation good caretakers of the family’s business or wealth.
Alfonso
: Families often position their conversations on stewardship by telling stories, for example, about how it all started, who came from where in the family, how grandfather started a business to support his young growing family, and grandmother raised the family and was the carrier of values.   I remember a family bringing the original cobbler tool box with the tools to a meeting to help the younger members of the family visualize how the founder started making shoes!  As true as the precept that work builds character, learning about your family, your business, your wealth, and those who created it and enjoyed it before you, will prepare the children to adopt a contemporary version, their version, of those core family values.
MT
: I would add to that and say that stewardship is also about a spirit of care and commitment to yourself and the rest of the family.  In this sense, the opposite of stewardship is entitlement.
Alfonso
: I completely agree Marie Therese.  I remember a family from which we learned how a strong sense of stewardship could help a business survive. What happened here was that at the time of transition from a strong father CEO to his children, the successor son ceded his position to his much better prepared sister.  This was a very difficult decision, because of the strong resistance from the father who even considered not retiring after learning of the change of plans! But she did manage to grow the business and actually retired early to make way for a nextgen successor.
MT
:  Education is key.  It is important to engage with young adults in an appropriate manner so that they may learn not only about financial matters but also what role they have to play.  “Stewardship” is a lifelong learning experience.
Alfonso
: Something I regularly hear from clients is that their children are not interested in financial markets. As Wealth Advisors, something we really strive to do is to give the “NextGen” a seat at the table…to make sure that they have the necessary knowledge to engage with and challenge their advisors when it will be their turn to review financial performance or to make other decisions regarding the family’s assets. A basic understanding of any structures through which family wealth is held is also essential, as is knowing the family’s advisors themselves.
MT
: Alfonso, are there any key questions we can share with our listeners? Certain things they should ask themselves as stakeholders?
Alfonso
: As a stakeholder, you should ask yourself “what am I a steward of?”  Stewardship is not about holding on to a particular business or keeping an investment long-held by the family.  Sometimes strong stewardship means selling the business you own jointly and maybe finding new ways of sticking together --maybe through philanthropy or establishing a family office, for instance.
For a family governance plan to work long term, it is extremely helpful to have owners and employees who fully understand their role, who have the right skillset needed to perform that particular role, and who have a mindset aiming to balance the current generation’s interests with those of the future generations.
MT
: This is indeed a delicate balancing act. One of my clients once said: “What you inherit from your parents you are actually borrowing from your children.”
Alfonso
: That’s a very good line…
MT
: Right? [And] Speaking of children, new challenges arise as families grow.  Something we have seen over and over again is that new generations are more likely to thrive as a family when there is a strong relationship between the family members, its internal or external advisors, trustees and financial advisors.  Keeping the family and the working group engaged is a great way to raise and discuss those issues that matter to all stakeholders and ensures a stable and supportive ecosystem of advisors who know the family and can provide continuity for future generations.
MT
: Alfonso, we’re almost out of time … what are some methods we have learned from other families on the relevance of good stewardship?
Alfonso
: One of my favorite techniques that I have seen families implement is running a “mock business” exercise.  An “on-the-job” training allows a stakeholder to test the skillset she thought she needed to perform her role in the enterprise or in the management of the family’s wealth-all in a safe environment.
MT
: Regular family meetings or retreats are [also] a great way to help the younger members of the family develop a strong sense of stewardship by understanding the technical aspects of their family’s wealth plan and the values driving it.
Alfonso
: You and I often talk about how engaging in goals-based planning driven by a family’s objectives is a great way to promote stewardship- if making wealth management decisions is an emotional experience, articulating goals can help reveal values, purpose and identity, and makes a person think about wealth in the more practical terms of liquidity, lifestyle, growth, legacy, spending, etc.
MT

Managing Director, Head of Private Business Advisory, J.P. Morgan Private Bank
Ken DiCairano,
Executive Director, Private Business Advisory, J.P. Morgan Private Bank
Andrew Oshman,
Executive Director, Private Business Advisory, J.P. Morgan Private BankBusiness owners are increasingly considering their timelines and options for a business transition. Consistent with prior years, that transition event is frequently a sale due to supply and demand factors.
The majority of businesses are owned by baby boomers who are rapidly approaching the age of retirement. A financial crisis and pandemic in the last 15 years have taken their toll.
On the demand side, record levels of cash on corporate balance sheets and the unprecedented amount of debt and equity capital needing to be invested have resulted in an attractive environment for many businesses in which to evaluate their alternatives.
If you’re thinking of selling your business—either now or in the future—be prepared to show buyers the synergistic fit with your company. Make it clear that there is more to offer than the expense reductions achieved by running two businesses as one.
It will further help you to make your case by understanding how the current environment is dramatically changing market conditions—forcing many buyers to search for ways to improve the sustainability of their business models and overcome new disruptions, whether in the form of new technology, competition or other forces.
Carefully position your sale with these factors in mind—or risk leaving value on the deal table.
The synergies challenge
Often, if M&A synergies are negotiated, the focus is on cost synergies: how the sale will save money/reduce operating expenses for the new entity. The value of revenue synergies usually doesn’t get structured into the deal price. Here’s why:
Cost synergies,
such as reducing headcount or eliminating duplicate facilities, are easier to anticipate and quantify. Such actions are also within management’s control, so there’s a greater probability of achieving results, and in a shorter timeframe after the deal closes. This is especially true when the buyer is publicly traded and must justify the value of a merger or acquisition to shareholders. To calculate future financial performance (i.e., the run rate), companies typically project the value of expense-saving synergies and give less attention to those that build sales or enhance market position.
Revenue synergies
are more difficult to quantify, in part because success is heavily dependent on others: the buyer (i.e., post-merger integration success) and various third parties (customers, resellers, competitors). Also, the value of revenue synergies, such as entering new markets, enhancing technological capabilities and adding complementary product sets, typically takes longer to realize. And the longer it takes and the more challenging to achieve, the less likely the seller will receive a share of the potential value.Synergies don’t just appear
Careful analysis is required, but it’s well worth the effort. It’s incumbent upon you as a seller to:
Analyze your company: A sell-side quality of earnings analysis performed by a third-party accounting firm, for example, can help you understand your company’s financial picture and profile, and help demonstrate the incremental value of an acquisition to potential strategic buyers.
Understand your buyer base: Your deal’s success depends on your knowing what a potential buyer is looking for and demonstrating how your company fits within its strategy.
Assemble your team to focus on post-merger integration (PMI), and work with a buyer to achieve PMI success before a deal closes. Keep in mind: The speed of integration is critical to successful M&A deals. Establishing an integration timeline and developing key performance indicators to monitor PMI ahead of time allow all parties to focus on these objectives on day one.
Working with your advisory team
Identifying synergies and finding buyers able to extract them are only half the battle. You will also want your advisory team to help:
Negotiate a deal that compensates you for the value of your business’s synergies and that sets the stage for them to be realized post-transaction.
Anticipate valuation gaps between you and the buyer. This is where earn-outs with defined, achievable metrics over a set time period after closing can be critical. Properly constructed, earn-outs provide sellers with the potential for increased proceeds, and buyers with the certainty of paying a premium for realized synergistic value.
Worth noting: Buyers received two-thirds or more of expected synergistic benefits in the immediate aftermath of the Great Recession. More recently, however, sellers have been able to capture a higher share of the total synergistic value, as synergies have become more commonplace in the case of an acquisition by buyers.Case study: How doing the homework pays off
Kathryn Joy, owner of a mid-sized U.S. manufacturer and distributor of consumer staples, believed potential synergies would make her business more attractive to select buyers, allowing for a higher sale price.
Two buyers came forward: Buyer One, a direct competitor, saw the acquisition as a way to leverage its expense structure and operational efficiency. Buyer Two, not a direct competitor, was positioned to benefit from the enhanced revenue opportunities through:
Complementary products: Ms. Joy’s company had 10 products, most with strong sales growth potential, to complement Buyer Two’s portfolio of 100 products.
International distribution: Buyer Two wanted to expand internationally, and a significant portion of Ms. Joy’s sales were in overseas markets.
Ms. Joy quickly realized Buyer Two saw her business as a better strategic fit than Buyer One: Buyer Two could leverage her global distribution network to quickly expand overseas and potentially minimize some of the cultural, regulatory and legislative obstacles inherent in international expansion.
As a result, Ms. Joy and her advisory team were able to negotiate a substantially higher acquisition premium than Buyer One offered to pay. In addition, she and her team negotiated an earn-out payment based on incremental international sales.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.We’ve put together this handy checklist with key considerations as you approach the sale of your business.The transition is a major shift in identity and day-to-day routine.We’ve been busy partnering with business owners to help them prepare for the most important transaction of their lives. Our experience suggests that many entrepreneurs are so focused on running their organisations that preparing their personal affairs before a sale often takes a back seat.
We recommend you start planning as far in advance as two years before a potential sale. But if that isn’t possible, it’s still important to address some of the key considerations before transaction day – however soon it might be.
Prepare to sell your business and for life beyond
We know you’re busy. So we’ve put together two handy checklists to help make sure you’re on top of the key issues as you approach the sale of your business. We’ve also highlighted some important things to think about for your
future.Secure independent tax and legal advice
Am I receiving the right independent tax and legal advice in relation to my personal affairs well in advance of selling my business?
Review my family’s shareholding
Have I reviewed my and (where relevant) my family’s shareholding in the business to ensure it is held optimally?
Check if I’m eligible for any business relief
Does my interest in the business qualify for any tax reliefs and how do they apply?
Assess my estate and inheritance tax position
Will my estate or inheritance tax position change when we sell our shares in the business?
Review wills and powers of attorney
Have I and the rest of my family put in place wills and lasting powers of attorney?
Calculate my family’s liquidity needs
Does my family need liquidity between now and when we sell the business?
Consider the impact on your family
How will this financially transformational event impact my family?  Do I need to have a conversation with them in
advance?Assess my family’s liquidity needs
How much liquidity do I and my family need in the short and medium term?
Set my financial goals
What are my short-, medium- and longer-term goals and aspirations for using our new wealth?
Consider my family’s lifestyle choices
What are the lifestyle choices we want to make? Where do we want to live?
Plan for my wealth and future investments
How should we hold the wealth and any future investments?
Protect my family’s assets
How do I protect the family’s assets from the risk of divorce?
Prepare for my first investment outside the business
I am not an investment specialist. How should I prepare to make my first investment outside the business?
Review my estate and inheritance tax position
How much estate/inheritance tax will be due when I die? Is there anything I could do about that?
Explore the meaning and purpose of the wealth
Do I want to give wealth to my wider family? Should I do it now or later? Are there causes we care about we would like to give to?
Consider how to structure my wealth
Are there ways to structure my wealth so I can retain control over the assets while giving it away to the next generation?
Think about philanthropy
Is our family philanthropic? What kind of an impact do we want to make in the world? Could philanthropy be an effective way to involve the next generation in our family wealth in the future and how should we effect and structure our giving?
Don’t underestimate the emotional side of selling your business
In addition to the tax and financial considerations of selling your business, the transition from being a CEO to a private investor is a major shift in identity, not to mention your day-to-day routine.While there can be exciting new opportunities for your family to explore together, you may also feel a sense of loss and the additional weight of responsibility that can come with a sudden increase in wealth.
Many of our clients have told us that they were surprised by the intensity of the emotions they experienced when they were selling their businesses. Yet as with all aspects of this process, forewarned is forearmed.
Whatever the dynamics of your sale, your ongoing involvement with the business and the aspirations of you and your family, it’s important to be aware of the challenges and opportunities involved with these phases. By understanding what the process could involve, you will be better placed not just to recognise the different stages as they unfold, but to take control and respond to them in positive ways.
How we can help you
Your J.P. Morgan team is here to guide you through the opportunities and pitfalls as you approach selling your business.
Our focus is to ensure you have the insight and guidance you need to understand the key issues involved. We want you to be equipped to act quickly and efficiently, while approaching all the important decisions with confidence.
Once you have realised the benefits of your hard work, we can help you invest, protect and grow your assets. The J.P. Morgan Private Bank team is here to support your decisions at every stage – from providing accurate forecasts of the returns you can expect through to advising on how to most effectively achieve your family’s philanthropic goals.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Your path to that future starts here.Many of our clients have assets they hope will grow in perpetuity. These assets may be an operating business, pool of investments, commercial real estate, something else or some combination. Whatever form it takes—the owner wants the asset not only to live beyond them, but also to thrive for generations to come.
While this is an admirable intent, time often takes a toll on wealth as it moves across generations. Corrosive complexities can develop: There can be challenges with the legal structure holding the asset. Family dynamics and communication can get tangled. There’s also Malthus’ Law: The sheer number of family members is likely to grow exponentially, which can create a burden unless the asset grows in tandem.
These challenges can be met, and the fruits of getting it right can be sweet. Here are some ways to get started on the path to perpetual growth for your assets. It all starts with the proper set up—which, if you are the wealth owner, is in your hands.
Four key questions to ask yourself now
In our approach to managing wealth, our
goals based advice framework
, we talk about buckets for liquidity, lifestyle, legacy—and perpetual growth. The purpose of the “perpetual growth bucket” is unique in that, unlike the others, you do not want its assets to be consumed during either your lifetime or your heirs’.
First, you should consider funding the two “buckets” to be used during your lifetime: liquidity and lifestyle. Next, you will want to decide whether you want a separate “legacy bucket” — to set aside some assets that can be used by the next generation.
Then you can turn your attention to “growing your forever money.” Before taking concrete actions, we recommend you ask yourself four questions that are critical to shaping your plans and helping them succeed:
Purpose—
What do you want the wealth to be used for?
Stewards—
Who will be tasked with owning and monitoring the assets beyond your lifetime?
Form—
How will the assets be held?
Horizon—
How long do you want these assets to grow?
How to find the answers that are right for you
Answering these questions is a process. You can jot down your best ideas right away, then revise and update them as your vision develops, circumstances change and you’ve spoken with family and trusted advisors. Your J.P. Morgan team can help inform your decisions by sharing best practices as well as our observations of what other clients in your circumstances have done and why.
Purpose
Perhaps you want, most of all, for your wealth to create a safety net or opportunities for generations well into the future. Maybe you’d like to create an enduring family business that provides career options for your progeny and community. Additionally, some wealth owners want to advance medical knowledge, support their communities or save the environment.
Whatever your vision may be, perpetual wealth can give you the opportunity to influence the destinies of the people you love and everything you’ve built. Involving family members in these discuss will help encourage a shared family vision and purpose. This can help enhance the likelihood of long-term success for your perpetual growth plans.
Stewards
You should also decide want to decide who will be responsible for the assets over time. Do you have family members who’ll be capable of fulfilling your vision? Or might your family be better served by outsourcing wealth management responsibilities to professionals?
Many families opt for a co-stewardship arrangement: a mix of family and professional management. But whenever you choose family stewards, we encourage you to consider how you might engage them to fully live up to this responsibility. Research finds that people tend to feel, and act, differently about money they’ve earned versus money they were given.
You’ll also want to consider what systems you can put in place to facilitate family stewards’ effective collaboration. How are family members staying engaged, particularly if professional stewards are helping manage the wealth? How are they agreeing on risk? Studies have shown that appetite for risk normally declines as the level of wealth increases, so how is the family going to be intentional about risk taken to fulfill the purpose of the wealth?
Before you make a final decision, though, we recommend speaking with your family members to find out whether each agrees with your vision, and can help you make it a reality.
Form
Do you intend for your assets’ current form to remain the same, or similar, forever? That is, do you want to keep your family business intact, in perpetuity? Or is it your desire to maintain a concentration in real estate generally or certain properties in particular?
And do you envision allowing that form to shift over time? If you do want to permit change, what triggers do you wish to allow? Consider circumstances, such as investment environment or consumer demand, or lack of family members capable or desirous of running and operating business.
Horizon
How long do you want these assets to grow? Is it truly forever? Or are there natural decision points (transitioning between generations, for example) when a different path might be more beneficial to your family?
Also, consider: some wealth owners want their beneficiaries to take the reins at some point, and to take complete ownership —free to redefine the wealth’s mission based on their own values or choices.
3 areas where you can make a difference
Once you’ve found your answers, it’ll be easier for you to prepare for this future-taking action in three key areas where some concrete plans can help ensure your plan’s success:
Investments
Because the “perpetual growth bucket” has such a long time horizon, wealth owners tend to allow these assets to have a heavier exposure to private/opportunistic investments, business ventures, concentrated holdings and leveraged strategies..
Also, with more stakeholders, it’s critical to be explicit about how investment decisions will be made over time.
Estate Planning
A “forever plan” for wealth often entails careful use of entities to help ensure coordinated management of the assets and smooth succession of wealth through generations. It can also enable funds to be set aside for liabilities that might arise for payments for emergency family and business needs, including possible transfer taxes depending on your jurisdiction.
For example: Putting the assets in trust and other wealth transfer techniques can help ensure continuity of ownership for many decades. Also, if the core asset is illiquid (business, real estate), ensuring adequate liquidity for emergency needs through another source (perhaps, a life insurance policy) might be key to allowing the family enterprise to continue over multiple generations.
Family Governance
Good decision making and communication will be essential for your plan to succeed —and you can get these started now by establishing periodic family meetings, guidelines about what information is shared by whom and when, and/or a family council, for instance. A collaborative approach to setting up the family governance framework can encourage the likelihood of family buy-in to the processes over the longer term.
Fair processes can help create a positive family culture that supports wealth. Once you decide how decisions on charitable distribution, investments and distributions to family members are to be made, communicating this ahead of time can go a long way to instill a sense of procedural fairness and reduce family conflict.
While it can be challenging to keep family members engaged, there is much you can do to set the stage for subsequent generations if you invest now in your family’s human capital, intellectual capital, and social capital—offering leadership tracks according to members’ skills and interests.
Your family’s future is being built now
Planning for what will happen when we are gone gives us a glimpse at mortality that most of us would rather not have. No wonder many wealth owners wait so long to develop their plans that some fail to do what’s needed in their lifetimes to assure the success of their visions beyond it.
Instead, we recommend taking charge now and focusing on the clarity and peace of mind that can come with knowing you are working to make your vision a reality.
It also can be good to know that you are not alone in this endeavor. Your J.P. Morgan team is here to help you build the future that you envision for generations to come.

https://privatebank.jpmorgan.com/gl/en/insights/giving/families-and-philanthropy-three-ways-to-get-everyone-involved,"PhilanthropyFamilies and philanthropy: Three ways to get everyone involvedauthors:- Amanda Lottauthors:- Sarah Bergpublished Date:- Oct 25, 2021Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.
Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.But first, think through the outcome you want!Why are you interested in family philanthropy?
Some families believe that having wealth engenders social responsibility, and encourage family members to embrace this ethos. Others want to establish or continue traditions that bring family members together, while burnishing individual and/or the family’s legacy. Still others view philanthropy as a way to help younger family members become more financially savvy—as well as generous. And many believe philanthropy is an essential ingredient in creating a joy-filled life, and want children and grandchildren to benefit from what they themselves have learned by giving back.
Moreover, families and individuals cite these same motivating factors as the impetus for their philanthropy regardless of their level of wealth.
The rationale for family philanthropy tends to be deeply personal and is often shaped by a parent or grandparent (or mentor) and/or your own lifetime experiences.
The questions below can help you refine your own motivations—and focus on the actions most likely to engage other family members.
1. Do you want to instill your core values in younger children?
A 30-something couple wanted their young children to learn to value education as much as they themselves do. So, they established a family tradition: Together with their children, they select an end-of-term gift for each child’s classroom as a way for the children to say “thank you” to the school and educators for all they’d learned that year—and to make the learning environment better for the next year’s class of children.
Perhaps in your experience:
You inherited certain principles and values from your parents or grandparents or other family members that you want your children to embrace. Or, an important family story shaped your approach to giving and you want to share it with the next generation(s).
You made a charitable gift and it had lasting results. Now, you’d like family members to have that experience. Similarly, over time, your giving has evolved and you want to pass on to family members the lessons you have learned.
Keep in mind: Values are often caught—not taught
Don’t wait for special occasions. Incorporate discussions about philanthropy and giving into your family’s daily life. For example:
Talk about the gifts you’ve given—monetary and otherwise—and needs you see within your community. Try to identify opportunities you think will be of interest to your family. While older children may not share your world view, focusing on the values you have in common (not the differences of your views) can help guide you forward as a family.
Volunteer! It’s one of the best ways to build a child’s character and self-esteem. Acquiring new skills, developing confidence and maturity, can help children put their problems in perspective—and learn civic responsibility at the same time. Volunteering is also a great way for the family to spend quality time together, share experiences and develop family traditions. For teens and young adults, it’s also a chance to identify their personal passions and areas of philanthropic interest.
2. Do you want to inspire the next generation(s) to be a wise financial steward?
The matriarch of a national family business regularly meets with her children and grandchildren over dinner to share insights about her life, philanthropy and business interests. She focuses on what’s going well, and what’s not working. Recently, she set aside a pool of money for her grandchildren to fund their own charitable interests. As a condition, they must collectively determine how they will use the money, (formally presenting their ideas to the matriarch) then regularly report back on results. Importantly, the youngsters are using this experience to guide their respective families’ philanthropy efforts—which also satisfies the matriarch’s aim: that her grandchildren learn to put their money to good purpose.
Be intentional:
What is the message around family and philanthropy that you want to convey to younger generations now and in the future? And how would you define success as a family over multiple generations?
How do you want to educate the next generation to steward wealth and grow into confident and capable adults? Inform your roadmap by taking the time to learn from the emerging generation: What are they passionate about?
It’s not (just) about sharing your balance sheet:
The story of your family’s founding matriarch and patriarch (and/or the business they built) can be meaningful when brought to life with examples of their successes and failures and the wisdom that they gained. For example, find a way to share these stories with younger family members; perhaps at a holiday dinner or during a family celebration or in a video interview.
Family philanthropy can be part of a broader process of teaching children about money, from learning how to spend and save responsibly; to evaluating the financial health of non-profit grantees; to managing an investment portfolio.
Hands-on experience is the best way for younger family members to learn. Consider creating discretionary pools through which they can support their own causes. Start small and increase funding slowly. Or, encourage personal giving. Some families match family members’ donations with a 1:1 or higher match. Setting up a donor-advised fund (DAF) for a generation or for individual family members can also provide a powerful learning experience—while allowing legal controls to remain in place.
3. Do you want your wealth to add meaning to your life and the lives of others?
After decades of growing the business he founded into an international success, an entrepreneur sold the company, in part so that he could explore other interests. Most particularly, he wanted to devote time and energy to helping his community thrive. Through a newly created foundation, he is doing just that: helping people and organizations connect with each other to tackle local issues and make the most of opportunities. In the process, the once driven entrepreneur is finding a broader purpose for his wealth and experience.
What does a meaningful, joy-filled life look like?
Families and individuals alike find that wealth enables, empowers and sometimes encumbers them in their pursuit of a meaningful life. Giving and being generous can help deepen an individual’s sense of purpose.
The families that most successfully help younger family members live their values are the ones who give rising generations as much responsibility as they can handle as soon as they can handle it. They believe that the best way to learn is to do.
Celebrate what you and your family have accomplished:
Often, a good place to start is to appreciate your family’s many strengths—not just its financial resources, but also its
human capital
(core values, communication skills, leadership capacity);
intellectual capital
(education and knowledge gleaned from experience); and
social capital
(social networks, community standing, family influence).
Then learn than by doing:
Be a student of your own motivations, passions and interests—and also those of your family. Have fun and enjoy each other! If you don’t have an extensive family, focus on the people you are close to: How might you influence their joy and drive impact?
Consider creating a mission statement that can be a reminder of what is driving your giving and the outcome you’re seeking with your and your family’s assets. This can be particularly helpful during periods of uncertainty, transition—or as the family gets larger, and the wealth moves further away from the wealth creator.
There are as many ways to engage as there are families!

https://privatebank.jpmorgan.com/gl/en/insights/planning/how-to-host-meaningful-family-meetings-throughout-the-year,"FamilyHow to host meaningful family meetings throughout the yearauthors:- Jamie Hacklemanpublished Date:- Jan 18, 2022Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.
Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Despite the challenges of the continued global pandemic, you can plan future family gatherings to sustain healthy connections.Family meetings often coincide with holidays and/or vacation, when people traditionally travel to be together. If your family members are staying home these days because of the global pandemic—or are worried about gathering at this time—there are other ways to have a productive conversation and maintain healthy connections.
While meeting virtually has become common in the workplace, doing so with family members can help build a sense of unity and shared purpose in responding to external challenges. This, in turn, can help family members look beyond individual views and opinions that may have grown more divergent, or help ease tensions heightened by the stress of the pandemic.
Whether you meet in person or virtually, the effective practices and suggestions below, developed over decades of our working with families, can help you and yours successfully gather to celebrate milestones, gain new insights and information, enhance communication skills and discuss important financial matters.
Define success for your family meeting
Articulating in advance what you would like to accomplish by convening the family can help you steer the meeting and set expectations for all family members. For example, you might use the meeting as an opportunity to:
Communicate
and share important updates about the health and well-being of family members, celebrate important milestones or report on the status of the family’s assets
Educate
family members on strategies that help steward the family’s wealth, including financial and investment principles, cybersecurity practices and basic estate planning techniques
Decide
the future direction of family assets, philanthropic commitments, investments or banking activities
Suggestion:
Set realistic goals to increase the likelihood of family members being satisfied with the outcome(s) of the meeting. For instance, sharing ways to effectively manage stress is more likely to engage family members and create goodwill than trying to get everyone to agree on matters of government policy.
Set the stage
Whether your family meeting is a formally structured event, hosted by an advisor, or an informal gathering, to help make your discussion successful:
Determine what communication tools and/or materials you’ll need. For videoconferences, select a platform everyone can (and knows how to) access, and have a backup plan for connectivity issues
Invite a facilitator or guest speaker who can aid discussion on certain topics; keep the meeting on track; and make sure everyone is heard
Designate a note taker to capture important details and agreed-upon follow-up steps
Involve the attendees. To optimize their engagement, consider polling family members in advance for topics they want to see addressed
Suggestion:
Ask younger family members for agenda topics. You might say: “We’re planning to review our family business results for the year. What topics would you like us to cover so we don’t miss anything?”
Create an agenda
Clarify what will be discussed during the meeting. Sample topics to consider discussing:
General risks to sustaining family wealth, including asset concentration, spending, leverage, taxes, family dynamics, liability and government actions; identify the challenges that most concern the family
Family values and core principles that family members want to adhere to as they conduct family matters and set priorities
The family’s philanthropic intent, strategy and goals, especially during giving season
Suggestion:
Say to the group: “To help us all recharge and reconnect during what has been a challenging year, let’s each share: 1) what we’re grateful for; 2) risks that we need to prepare for together (e.g., lack of estate planning); and 3) charitable causes you’d like to support now or in the new year.”
Establish ground rules
Let everyone know ahead of time how the meeting will be conducted:
Outline simple ground rules for the meeting (e.g., no cell phone usage during the meeting, listen respectfully, limit interruptions, avoid personal attacks, end on time)
Clarify which subjects will and won’t be addressed during the meeting
Engage family members by sharing the hosting, asking them to lead conversations, and encouraging everyone’s voice to be heard
Suggestion:
Begin your family meeting with this introduction: “Thanks for your time today. I know we all want to talk about [our beloved sports team/other favorite family topic]—but let’s wait until later in our meeting. For the next hour, let’s devote our full attention and listening skills to covering our agenda. Before I turn the meeting over to [name] to kick off our discussion, can we agree to place our phones aside so we’re not tempted by them?”
Guide the meeting
Keep the discussion focused on key topics:
Note which if any issues will be deferred to the end of the session or future gatherings and follow-up communications
Be prepared for difficult conversations, and plan in advance how to handle conflict and defuse a situation; for example, by offering to address certain topics in a separate conversation, or restating a family rule to avoid hurtful statements
If feasible, make a recreational activity, such as a family hike, part of the gathering to strengthen family bonds. If the meeting is virtual, consider an online game or round-robin sharing of favorite movies, television shows and books
Choose your battles
A family meeting is unlikely to change anyone’s personal views or opinions. For those families with divergent views, consider these points:
Pick topics carefully. It may not be worth trying to discuss issues the family is unlikely to agree on. If there is a compelling reason to discuss a sensitive issue, consider inviting an outside specialist to moderate the conversation
Be curious. If family members are willing to bring up a potentially divisive topic, encourage all participants to approach the conversation from a place of curiosity, and be willing to listen and learn
Don’t feel compelled to complete a debate. Agreeing to disagree may help to advance the conversation to other topics
Emphasize common values
A family’s shared values and principles can serve as a powerful North star in acknowledging what the family has in common, and they can guide the decisions and conversations of a family. Questions to help identify values include:
What core beliefs does the family affirm and represent?
What qualities do you wish to convey to future generations?
What do you care about most?
Suggestion:
Acknowledge the political differences of your family’s multigenerational members, then work together to articulate your common values and define your philanthropy goals. For example, one family (committed to education) defined success as identifying organizations that aligned with their mission and vision. Separately, family members used donor-advised funds to support causes that synched with their individual ideologies.
Share stories and insights
Family meetings can be a wonderful venue for learning about each other’s passions, hopes and interests. Consider using questions such as these to guide conversations:
What is the best advice you have ever received?
What is your life’s dream?
What do you look forward to most when the pandemic ends?
Learn from the experience of other families
Family meetings can help participants develop their communication skills, and build trust so they can meet challenges together down the road. Learning about the family’s wide-ranging activities can also help individual members find new ways to become involved. Speak with your J.P. Morgan team on potential topics for productive family conversations.Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.There are advantages for business owners who qualify—but also risks and an uncertain future.The $10,000 U.S. federal cap on deductions for state and local taxes (SALT) is, understandably, on the minds of many taxpayers in high-tax states.
You may have heard about the “SALT cap workaround,” and wondered what it involves and whether you are eligible.
The short answer is: For some owners of pass-through entities (PTEs)—including partnerships, S corporations and certain LLCs—this strategy may enable you to deduct, indirectly, state and local taxes paid by the PTE, beyond the SALT cap.
Below, we answer a number of the other important and frequently asked questions about the SALT cap workaround. As you consider its potential usefulness, keep in mind that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) plans to issue more guidance and that the future of the SALT cap in Congress is unclear.
What is the $10,000 SALT cap?
The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act temporarily capped the deduction for aggregate state and local taxes, including income and property taxes (or sales taxes in lieu of income taxes), at $10,000. The SALT cap is set to expire after 2025. For now, it mainly affects high-income earners who live in high-tax states and itemize deductions.
What is the SALT cap workaround?
The SALT cap is applicable to individuals—but not entities. Armed with this distinction, more than half of the 41 states with a state income tax have enacted laws giving PTEs the option (or even the requirement) to pay state and local taxes at the entity level. This so-called “workaround” benefits individual taxpayers for federal tax purposes in two ways:
Individual PTE owners, who would have been subject to the $10,000 SALT deduction cap if they had paid state and local taxes directly, see the benefit of taxes paid by the PTE reflected in a reduction of their shares of PTE income
For some PTE owners, the workaround may offer a greater net benefit than an itemized tax deduction, which might be offset by the alternative minimum tax and net investment income tax
Other benefits may be available, depending on facts and circumstances, particularly at the state level.
How does the IRS view this strategy?
In late 2020, the IRS expressly authorized the SALT cap workaround and announced its intention to issue further regulations.
1
PTEs in states that have enacted entity-level tax laws can use the workaround for “Specified Income Tax Payments” made on or after November 9, 2020 (the date of the IRS Notice), or in certain circumstances, for taxes previously paid pursuant to a law enacted by a state or local jurisdiction (including the District of Columbia) prior to this date.
Which states have enacted this PTE tax legislation?
So far, more than 30 states have passed laws offering an entity-level tax on PTEs, giving individual owners complete or partial SALT cap relief. These laws have a variety of effective dates and other differences.
View infoCan any business organized as a PTE use the SALT cap workaround?
Generally, the workaround is available to operating businesses. Unfortunately, the extent to which a pure investment partnership can use it is less certain.
There is limited precedent, and current IRS guidance does not clearly distinguish between PTE taxes paid on different types of income (e.g., trade or business income versus investment income).
Without more clarity on this issue, investment partnerships or family offices organized as PTEs may be reluctant to take an approach that could attract scrutiny from the IRS.
How does a PTE election work?
Most states that permit the PTE tax deduction allow PTEs to make an annual election by a deadline, with some form of notice to, or consent from, the PTE owners. PTEs need to plan ahead to give themselves time to contact all the owners and obtain consent, or wait out a notice period.
A PTE also may want to consider the jurisdiction of its owners and its source of income to determine the overall impact of making the election. The election could help some owners and harm others. PTEs with many partners or members in different jurisdictions might consider using separate feeder vehicles, if the tax savings justify the effort.
What is the outlook for the SALT cap workaround?
There are several potentially significant developments on the horizon.
The Treasury Department has committed to issuing further guidance on the SALT cap,
2
but the timing is uncertain
Without action by Congress, the SALT cap is set to expire after 2025, but nonetheless we expect the PTE tax election may continue to have value regardless of what Congress does
What should you do now?
If you are an equity owner in a pass-through entity that operates in a state that has enacted this legislation, you should review these provisions to determine if such selections are advantageous to all individual owners. Reach out to us with your questions to draw on our knowledge, experience and resources in this evolving area. Of course, you should also always consult your tax and legal advisors for advice specific to your facts and circumstances.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Here are five actions that can help create a sound estate plan
Everybody always tells us we need an estate plan. But do we really? And what does that actually mean and how do we go about creating one—or checking the one we have?
You want a well-thought-out estate plan so that if, and when you are incapacitated or pass away, what you’d like to happen (to you, your assets and family members) actually does. That means you need to put some basic legal documents in place and take some key actions.
Here, we offer the five actions needed to create a sound estate plan. These apply to every U.S. adult—no exceptions. So if you haven’t taken these estate planning steps, we strongly recommend you do so as soon as possible.
Estate Planning Checklist
1.
Know what you have.
Take an inventory of your assets and where they are held. That includes all your investment and retirement accounts, as well as insurance policies, deeds and safe deposit boxes. This accounting is essential information for anyone who will be handling your estate.
2.
Look carefully at how your assets are owned.
We cannot emphasize how important it is for you to know whether the assets are held jointly or solely. With your retirement accounts and insurance policies, it is critical that you name both primary
and
contingent beneficiaries.
Titling can make a big difference in how assets transfer to people.  For example, your will may not control how jointly held assets will pass. Rather, jointly held property will pass automatically to the joint owner if held with rights of survivorship (often referred to as “JTWROS” property) or as tenants by the entirety (a form of joint ownership for married couples in some states.)
Neither does your will control assets that pass via beneficiary designation, like an IRA, 401(k) or life insurance; instead these assets will pass to whomever you designate in the beneficiary form. If you haven’t designated a beneficiary for your retirement account or insurance policy, the assets or insurance proceeds still are not subject to your will, but rather will be transferred according to whatever your retirement plan or insurance provider has as its default beneficiary—typically that’ll be your estate or, if you’re married, your spouse.
3.
Make a will, sign it and be sure you follow your state’s rules so the will is considered valid.
For many reasons, people tend to put off making a will. But if you don’t have a will, it will be the state in which you have lived that will dictate to whom, how, and when any assets you own in your sole name (other than beneficiary designation assets, mentioned in number 2, above) will be distributed.
Also, if you have minor children, identify a guardian for them in your will. If you do not, the state may get involved in determining who becomes their legal guardian.
4.
Name someone to make financial and medical decisions for you when you cannot.
If something happens to you and you can no longer make important financial or medical decisions for yourself, you’ll want to have someone you trust—e.g., a family member or professional—with the authority to do so. There are separate legal documents you’ll need to make sure this happens: a power of attorney for financial decisions; and, for the medical decisions, a healthcare proxy (which may be called something different in different states). In addition to signing formal documents, be sure to discuss with your trusted family member or professional the kinds of decisions you’d like them to make for you. Also consider creating a “living will” to let your healthcare providers know your wishes regarding a variety of medical options.
5.
Speak to everyone involved.
A simple but key estate planning tip is to make a list of all your advisors (accountant, attorney, financial, etc.) and key family members so that the people who handle your estate will know whom to contact. Also consider letting your family know the outlines of your estate plan. Communication—especially if you have a blended or complex family situation—can be key to making sure that your wishes are carried out, and your family lives harmoniously.
We can help
These are the basic building blocks of an estate plan that everyone should have if they want to decide who benefits from their assets and how they, and their family, will be taken care of. There are additional estate planning strategies for people who have significant wealth and a desire to do multigenerational and/or charitable giving. For example, you may want to consider whether trusts might serve your goals. You also might explore different approaches to furthering your children’s (and grandchildren’s) education. Speak with your J.P. Morgan team about your family’s needs.

Today’s market volatility has some investors wondering if they are a little too concentrated in some positions. It can be unnerving to watch stock values rollercoaster—especially when, since the start of 2021, a staggering one in 10 companies in the Russell 3000 Index has suffered a 70% drawdown from which it’s yet to recover.
1
A look at your concentrated holdings may be advisable. Our research consistently finds that concentrated positions historically have been both the great creator and destroyer of fortunes.
2
However, in our view  applying simple solutions to any concentrations you have might not always be the best approach.
A widely accepted rule of thumb claims that a properly diversified portfolio must have no more than 10 to 20 percent of total investment assets in a particular stock. But reality is usually more complicated. Certainly, standardized percentage-based rules never made sense for many investors, especially the top executives and owners of public and private businesses who cannot help but have significant holdings in their companies.
Instead, we find it helpful to take a nuanced approach to help clients find their “numbers.” Your acceptable level of concentration will depend on your circumstances, objectives and tolerance for risk. A complete conversation is recommended.
Here, though, we can describe the general framework we use to help clients determine how much diversification they might need to achieve their goals.
Step 1: Identify why you hold a concentrated stock position
There are many paths that lead people into a concentrated position.
Perhaps you are employed by the company whose stock you hold and there are limits to diversifying (e.g., company mandates and/or public perception).
Or maybe the root cause is a sense of control: Because you work at (or own) the company, you feel you understand it best and can have the most impact on its prospects?
We find many clients are simply waiting for their stocks to hit specific price targets. Especially in volatile times, it can feel difficult to sell a position for less than it was worth just a few weeks ago. Are you waiting for a rebound to prior highs?
Step 2: Assess your circumstances
Take a thorough look at your full financial picture so that you can be clear about how important diversification might be for your long-term fiscal health.
Which category best describes your situation?
1. Protected
—You could lose your entire concentrated position tomorrow and still be able to support your current lifestyle and long-term goals
2. Vulnerable
—You need a portion of your concentrated position if you are going to stay on track to achieve your long-term goals
It’s obviously reassuring to see proof that you are in the “protected” category, and to identify precisely how much downside you might absorb before your lifestyle is affected. Such knowledge can also help give you the confidence that if your stock values hold steady or improve, you might be able to dream bigger and start implementing a variety of planning techniques to achieve these new goals.
If you find yourself in the “vulnerable” category (and even many of our wealthiest clients do), it can be helpful to tally what you are trying to achieve and back into the minimum amount you’d need to diversify to achieve these goals. This is your “minimum dose of diversification” benchmark.
Then we suggest shifting your focus.
Rather than looking at how much of your portfolio is in the concentrated position, we suggest evaluating how much (and which parts) of your future might be at risk due to your concentration.
This exercise is often empowering because it lets you see your target number and assess all potential fixes, given your earning capacity, potential stock performances, spending and goals.
For example: Imagine an investor has a $100MM balance sheet, but $50MM is in a single stock. Obviously, she is concentrated by standard definitions. However, if she is 50 years old and spends $1MM/year, she should be able to sleep at night knowing that her entire concentration could zero out tomorrow and her lifestyle would not be impacted.
However, if that same person spends $1.5MM/year, the concentrated stock’s performance would be crucial to sustaining her current lifestyle.Step 3: Free yourself to find your best path
If all this assessing sounds like going for the medical exam you know you need but would rather not schedule, here are a few scientifically backed thought exercises that could liberate you:
Imagine it’s not yours
—Pretend these investments belong to your friend James, and he asks you to give him financial advice. “Is this a good use of my capital? Does this look like a smart idea? Am I too concentrated?”
What would you tell him?
Start from now
—Imagine you don’t own your concentrated holding, but are instead presented with the opportunity, right now, to buy the entire position at a price exactly equal to however much you have invested.
Would it be a good investment for your goals?
Regain control
—In holding on to a concentrated position, we’re actually not exercising control, but rather relinquishing it. We’re sitting back, waiting for circumstances to dictate our options.
Real control comes from creating a strategic plan for our wealth.
Remember your goals
—Why are you investing your money? What is the intention of your wealth? It’s rare that we want a specific number of shares in a specific company or industry. Few set out to have X percent of ABC Company. Instead, we want what that investment, that wealth, might provide. So ask yourself:
Does this consolidated positions help you pursue these desires? Or is there a better way?
We can help
Your concentration may be both an opportunity and a risk. But only by sizing that potential risk and what it may mean for you and your family, can you begin to choose from among the many solutions that might be available.
Speak to your J.P. Morgan team about having your concentration risk assessed. Turn any concern about volatile markets you might have today into a chance to chart an even better path to achieving your financial goals over the long term.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.When you understand how and why you make decisions, you can create and sustain a wealth strategy that serves your goals for the long haul.Money can’t buy love, but it might fund happiness—if used wisely. If we understand the power of planning with intent and how we make decisions, we can pursue
financial
goals that will help us achieve
personal
ones.
That principle lies at the heart of goals-based planning: creating a wealth strategy that uses financial resources to achieve whatever we believe truly matters in life. Make a plan, own the plan and stick to the plan. It’s not a complicated approach, but it’s not always easy to follow. Here’s how and why your J.P. Morgan team uses that approach to create—and sustain—a wealth strategy that can work for you.
First, a little context. The field of research known as behavioral science provides the intellectual underpinning of our goals-based planning. Behavioral science reveals the hidden forces behind our often irrational decision making. In the financial realm, this discipline explores the psychology of money.
Here’s the good news. The same forces that lead us to make poor decisions can be harnessed to help create the outcomes we really want. We cannot change human nature, but we can create frameworks to use it for our own good. Goals-based planning is one such framework.
At a high level, the very act of identifying financial goals compels us to consider and articulate personal ones. Research shows that the attributes revealed by this exercise—our values, purpose and identity—are what truly motivate us and, ultimately, give us the deepest satisfaction. On a practical level, the science helps us make a plan, own that plan and then stick to it.
What we do together
The first step in our goals-based framework is to explicitly identify the primary purpose, or intent, for your wealth. In other words, what path do you want your wealth to take over time? Consider these options:Next, we define those personal goals that support our chosen intentions. Every goal has four critical components: a dollar amount, a label, a time horizon and a priority level. For example, it’s a high priority to spend $1,000,000 annually in retirement, or it’d be nice to buy a $3 million mountain home next year.
We then organize these different goals into buckets, such as liquidity, lifestyle, legacy, and perpetual growth. We can thus align various pools of capital to strategies that will serve the purpose of the bucket.
When we identify intentions for our wealth and define our goals, we make and manage a plan that can serve us well over the long haul. Focusing our wealth into buckets puts our long-term goals into a specific, tangible form, allowing us to connect to the future and stick to our carefully constructed plan.
Why do those things matter? Because of the science.
The utility of mental accounting
In making a plan, we embrace the behavioral bias of mental accounting. This is the process by which we value money differently depending on the source or use of that money—$10,000 in casino winnings just feels very different from a $10,000 pay raise; $10,000 earmarked for gifts feels different from $10,000 targeted for home maintenance. Not surprisingly, we spend casino winnings more carelessly than salary; we buy gifts more joyfully than we pay bills.
In other words, we categorize our money and make mental accounts. This may not be entirely rational, but it’s quite useful. It prevents us from getting overwhelmed and, if done intentionally, allows us to pursue multiple financial goals with efficiency and focus. For example, if the down payment for our lake house is separate from the money earmarked for retirement and still separate from our grandchildren’s education fund, we can focus on decisions within each account as they arise, instead of worrying about the whole of our wealth.
The step of organizing goals into different buckets harnesses the power of mental accounting by aligning different goals to different buckets and, ultimately, different strategies that will help you reach those goals. It gives you a clear roadmap for decisions to make around planning, investing, borrowing and banking, depending on the underlying purpose of each bucket.
Take pride in your creation
The Swedish furniture store Ikea built a multinational empire by understanding that when people build something themselves—such as a bookcase or a desk—they value it more highly than a similar item bought ready-made. This simple yet powerful idea has come to be known as the “Ikea Effect,” a corollary of the endowment effect, whereby we attach a greater value to things we own.
What that means is that when we have a hand in building our financial plans, we have a greater sense of ownership in them—we will value them more highly than something off-the-shelf. The very process of building a plan makes it more valuable.
We want you to own and embrace your financial plan. That’s why the goals-based framework is something that can be done in partnership with your J.P. Morgan team. The wealth strategy we create should reflect your unique vision, ideals, family and future.
Defining the future
What happens when we want to abandon our plans? We’ve all started a diet, exercise routine or financial strategy, only to stray when presented with a fresh temptation such as a delicious dessert or hot investment trend.
Behavioral science tells us this happens because we lack a connection to the long-term consequences of our actions. We actually think of our future selves as completely different people. Whether it’s the impact on our bottom lines or our waistlines, the consequences of our decisions today will be felt by “someone else” tomorrow. In short, we don’t stick to our plans because they benefit a future that we can’t quite imagine.
By making our goals as specific and detailed as possible—by separating them into buckets with timelines and dollar amounts, and priorities—we bring the future into tight focus. In this way, we more easily make emotional, visceral connections to those future goals. This helps us resist the urges to shift our short-term strategies without considering the impact on our well-defined, long-term goals, which in turn makes it easier to stick to our plans.

Throughout the wealth creator's lifetime, the creator could spend their assets down to zero dollars at the end of their lifetime or divide their wealth at the end of lifetime and give away to beneficiaries. If they'd like their wealth to extend beyond their lifetime, they could preserve it so their family wealth is structurally sustained across generations or grow the family wealth in perpetuity.Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Higher rates and tighter financial conditions create challenges for economies and asset markets. Here’s what you need to know.The Federal Reserve’s campaign against inflation has been the key driver of global financial markets this year. Headline inflation, which touched a 40-year high, coupled with a tight labor market are pushing the Fed to aggressively tighten financial conditions.
Financial conditions broadly describe the economic environment for citizens and corporations. Tighter conditions mean consumers and corporations are less likely to borrow or invest, leading to a decline in future growth and inflation. Absent a recession, financial conditions never tightened as much in a six-month period as they have in the first half of 2022. It’s the end of COVID-19 easy money.
We see this new dynamic in three key areas—rates, liquidity and fiscal policy, as these five charts make clear.
Rates: An aggressive path to higher rates and yields
Central banks globally are charting aggressive hiking paths. The market anticipates that the Fed will hike the federal funds (policy) rate to ~ 3.5% by the first quarter of 2023. This would be the speediest hiking cycle since the mid-1990s, bringing the policy rate to its highest level in over a decade.
What’s more, the market expects the Fed to keep the fed funds rate near 3% for a decade.
The European Central Bank (ECB) is also expected to have positive interest rates—for the first time in a decade.While the Fed has only just started raising rates, Americans are already feeling the effects of expected hikes:
The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has surged to nearly 6%, from just 3% at the start of the year.
Monthly principal and interest payments on a 30-year fixed USD mortgage on a $510,000 home (the latest average price) jumped from ~$1,200 to $1,850.
The combination of higher mortgage rates and still-high home prices means that U.S. home affordability has plummeted to 2006 levels.For borrowers, the cost of financing has soared. Just last year, there was over USD 18 trillion of negative yielding debt globally. That glacier has melted to just USD 2 trillion today.Liquidity: Central bank balance sheets are shrinking
During the era of easy money, central bank balance sheets ballooned—first in the wake of the global financial crisis and more recently in response to COVID-19. The Fed’s balance sheet swelled from USD ~4 trillion pre-COVID-19 to USD ~9 trillion today, as the Fed bought Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities. This added abundant liquidity to the financial system, pushing up asset prices.
Now, in a process known as quantitative tightening (QT), balance sheets may shrink and liquidity in the financial system will decline.
Market participants expect the Fed’s balance sheet to shrink to under USD 7 trillion by 2025, pushing the size of the balance sheet, relative to GDP, back to pre-COVID-19 levels.In Europe, QT will mean that the ECB stops buying corporate bonds. That change is imminent, and its impact could be significant. Currently, the ECB owns roughly one-third of the eligible corporate bond universe.
Fiscal policy: Diminished government support, lower savings rates
Across the world, governments have offered a range of fiscal support to mitigate the impact of the pandemic. European countries such as Italy and Germany have introduced spending measures to shield consumers from the full impact of higher energy prices.
In the United States, fiscal support was the most pronounced. At the peak of COVID-19 fiscal stimulus, over one-third of American personal income came from transfers from the U.S. government.
As that support is disappearing, Americans are quickly spending down their excess savings. This could impact overall consumer spending and thus economic growth.Investment implications
How can you think about the end of easy money as it relates to your portfolio and family goals?
With the rate hiking cycle underway, yields have already moved higher—much higher in some cases. Higher yields can make for a good entry point to build a position in core fixed income, which still should offer a valuable ballast to portfolios. And if recession fears intensify, bond yields would likely fall, boosting total returns for existing bond portfolios.
As the end of easy money ushers in a period of sluggish economic growth, company margins and earnings will likely come under pressure. In this environment, quality companies (with fortress balance sheets and steady cash flow streams) should provide more consistent and reliable earnings growth. In our view, quality equities should outperform.

As you think about the implications of the end of easy money, your risk tolerance and investment goals should inform your decision making. Your J.P. Morgan team can help design a portfolio aimed for your financial goals.This chart shows the Fed funds rate and ECB deposit rate from 2015 to 2022, and shows the expected rate hikes heading into 2024. In 2015, the Fed funds rate and ECB deposit rate were about .125% and (-.2%) respectively. In 2023, the Fed funds rate and ECB deposit rate are expected to rise to 3.5% and 1.0% respectively.This chart shows the Affordability Index and average new home sale price in the U.S. from 2004 to 2022. In January of 2004, the affordability index began at 124.65 and the average new home sale price was about $250,000. After rising to a series high of about 200 in 2012, the affordability index sits at 115 in 2022. With an average new home sale price of about $515,000, affordability in 2022 has dropped to 2006 levels.This chart shows the share of the Bloomberg Global Agg index with negative yielding debt from 2014 to 2022. It began close to 0% then rose to 7.4% on December 2014 and 25.7% in June 2016. It fell to 12.8% in September 2018 before rising again to a series high of 29.8% in August 2019. It fell from here to 18.2% in March 2020 and 4.5% in April 2022.This chart shows the Fed balance sheet as a percentage of United States GDP from 1990 to 2022. It began close to 5% and then rose to 15% in 2008. It climbed to around 25% in 2014 before falling to 18% in 2019. From here, it rose to a series high of 37.9% in 2022. It is projected to fall at around 22.7% at the end of 2024.This chart shows government transfers as a percentage of Americans’ personal income from 2011 to 2022. The percentage stays rather flat at around 17% from 2011 to 2019 before spiking to 31% in April of 2020. We see this percentage fall to around 18.9% in November of 2020 before jumping back up to 33.6% in 2021.

Already the average U.S. household now has more than 10 internet-connected devices in residence, and that number is rapidly growing—both in the United States and across the globe.
1
Indeed, by 2023, it is estimated there will be three times more networked devices on the planet than humans.
2
Yet all these new “smart devices,” including fitness equipment, digital personal assistants, gaming consoles, thermostats and security cameras, etc., can potentially endanger not only our privacy and physical safety, but our finances as well. Just think: Even President Biden’s connected exercise bike had to be modified so it would not endanger U.S. national security.
Of course, no one is likely to give up the digital gadgets that make life easier and fun. But it is wise for all of us to recognize there’s a new and urgent need to guard the door into our lives that internet-enabled devices prop open.
The digital embrace increases—exponentially
How many internet-connected devices do you have at home right now? Don’t just count the televisions, gaming consoles, computers, printers, laptops, tablets, phones, digital watches, digital personal assistants, music systems and nanny cams.
We also have to keep an eye on the ever-growing list of internet-enabled devices that help make our homes a Sanctuary. That includes security systems and all the smart devices installed in our homes: refrigerators and vacuums as well as lighting, thermostats, and yes, workout equipment.
In fact, property technology, or “PropTech,” is already a new category in the world of real estate. Smart home technology has even become standard in some upscale homes and multi-family dwellings.
Security vulnerabilities in IOT devices
How dangerous might these devices be to you and your family?
Your digital conveniences—fitness and health data, home entertainment systems, energy usage, voice recordings and sites you access—all can be used to build a profile of you and your family that criminals can leverage to commit financial fraud, privacy invasions and even home break-ins, both physical and cyber.
You might not have even been aware you signed terms and conditions to allow these devices to listen, collect usage data and allow manufacturers to sell or share your information with third parties.
Cybercriminals can put even the most innocent-seeming devices to nefarious uses:
A home thermostat could reveal you are not at the house during the week and only home on the weekends when the temperature has been remotely set higher.
A smart vacuum can create a map of your home layout and share the data back to the manufacturers, potentially giving insights to thieves.
Fitness equipment could be used to listen to your conversations, as well as capture and share your personal health information.
Protect yourself now
It’d be natural to think that internet connectivity is so woven into our daily lives that there is little you can do—or to despair, thinking that meaningful action would require hours of your time or a tech-obsessed teenaged child. Not so. There are some simple things you can do fairly quickly.
First, we recommend that you have at least two separate networks in your home. Use one for all your business, sensitive transactions and remote work. Dedicate a separate network for less sensitive transactions, for instance, your children's or parents’ online activities, schoolwork, family entertainment and social media. If you have a highly connected home, consider adding a third network, possibly solely for smart devices.
Next, and it cannot be stressed how important this simple step remains: Make sure your passwords are complicated, changed regularly, and different across devices and networks. Consider using a reputable password manager to help you securely manage all those usernames and passwords.
Put a webcam cover on your computers, laptops, tablets and fitness equipment when you’re not using their cameras. And be sure to put your devices on “mute” when you’re not using them.
Avoid adding new smart devices to your home network without professional input, as correct device set up is as critical as device security. And, before you move into a new home, find out what sort of internet-enabled devices may be built into them.
Help is available
You do not have to tackle the challenge of your digital life alone. While President Biden obviously has top security professionals watching his digital back, you can enlist the help of experts too. Many reputable firms can help you with both installation and security upkeep.
You also can contact your J.P. Morgan team to learn more about our cybersecurity and fraud awareness programs, or to schedule a session with our cybersecurity experts.

Of course you want your children to thrive, to be as happy and successful as they can be. Along with parental love and practical advice, you may want to transfer some of your wealth to your children. To transfer wealth in the most protective and tax-efficient way possible, consider using a trust.
The structure of your trust should reflect both your own and your children’s financial, professional and personal goals. But different generations have different perspectives, so having multigenerational understanding and dialogue are crucial to prudent trust and estate planning. In particular, you may want to consider the next generation’s proclivity for philanthropy, their entrepreneurial spirit and desire to get married later in life.  Understanding the worldview of your children’s generation, whether Millennials (born 1981–1996) or Gen Z (born 1997–2012), can impact how you think about setting up the most effective trust structure and strategy to support your own children’s passions and goals.Philanthropic passion
Millennials and Gen Z are more likely to donate to charity than any other generation.
1
The pandemic seems to have intensified that commitment. According to one recent survey, 60% of Millennials voiced an increased interest in philanthropy due to COVID-19.
2
Sometimes the focus is domestic, while at other times Millennials pursue international giving objectives.
How can a trust support your children’s philanthropic goals?
Many times, trust documents are written to distribute funds to beneficiaries according to the ascertainable standard (to help pay for their health, education, maintenance and support). However, this standard provision wouldn’t allow your children to withdraw trust funds to support their philanthropic endeavors. An alternative structure,
including a charitable beneficiary alongside your children, can give a trustee the power to distribute trust assets to charity.
You may consider establishing
either a private foundation or donor-advised fund
account, which could be the charitable beneficiary of the trust. Your descendants can sit on the board of the foundation and influence its donation strategy, and you could grant the trustee or your descendants certain powers to direct trust distributions to the foundation.   Having an experienced team of philanthropy professionals to help operate and advise the foundation through overseeing various aspects of administration and grant management can further preserve the legacy of your trust.
Entrepreneurial spiri
t
Americans have long been known for an entrepreneurial spirit, but it may be especially pronounced among Millennials. One survey found that 66% of Millennials aspire to start their own businesses, and 61% of them feel they would have more job security by owning their own companies.
3
Here are a few ways you might help your children make that dream come true:
Boost your children’s business engagement and sense of entrepreneurship by setting up a trust
. How might that spark an entrepreneurial spirit? Just knowing a trust is there might give your children the peace of mind to try something entrepreneurial, taking on the risks of starting a business that others, without a safety net, would find daunting.  To encourage your children’s engagement in your privately held business you could also consider transferring an interest in that business to a trust that benefits your children.  But it is critical to choose the right trustee to provide guidance and expertise.
Put seed money for your children’s businesses in a trust.
Doing so would provide a resource to fund your children’s entrepreneurial ideas, while providing guardrails and oversight to protect the principal of the trust. Ensure that you work closely with an estate planning lawyer as well as a responsible and knowledgeable trustee so the terms of that trust’s distribution or loans from the trust work well for the children’s goals. Specifically, a trust can be set up to allow the trustee to support reasonable entrepreneurial initiatives, if your children choose to pursue them.
Later-in-life marriage
As many aspiring grandparents know, children of Baby Boomers are getting married later in life. In fact, Pew Research found that Millennials are getting married on average four years later in life than their counterparts in 1987.
4
Marrying later means that many members of the Millennial and Gen Z generations may have accrued a substantial pool of assets by the time they do tie the knot. That may strengthen the argument for a
pre-nuptial agreement
.
If you do not want to broach this sensitive subject with your children, there are other ways to ensure that the wealth you intend for your children cannot be claimed by a potential ex-spouse:
Establish a separate property trust for your children.
This would help distinguish marital property from separate property in the trust (essentially property acquired before marriage or through inheritance or a gift). The assets in the trust are generally not considered marital property.
Consider creating a dynasty trust.
Such a trust, especially when created in favorable jurisdictions such as Delaware, would help transfer your assets from generation to generation without incurring transfer taxes, while providing asset protection in perpetuity. The terms of the trust may or may not include spouses of the family members or the option for a beneficiary to appoint trust assets to a spouse.
You want your wealth to best support your children’s ambitions and aspirations—and your trust should be structured accordingly. When establishing any type of trust structure, we recommend you involve the next generation early on—together, you’re building a family legacy.
Your J.P. Morgan team can work closely with you and your attorney to help you make sure your trust works well for you and your children, and that it is well positioned to meet the challenges of the future. We administer approximately $240B of trust assets globally, handling virtually every type of family, situation and asset type.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Identifying the approach to your wealth can help you navigate through volatile timesFinancial markets can offer a great opportunity to grow wealth, but they can be volatile. That volatility can make investors uneasy—sometimes ushering in feelings of fear, or even excitement about potential opportunities. Reacting to market movements may sometimes seem like the right thing to do for the short term—but what are the long-term consequences?
For starters, volatility is a feature, not a bug, of investing. The S&P 500 has suffered a pullback of 10% or more in 21 of the last 42 years. Despite those selloffs, however, the index still managed to post a positive return in 32 of the 42 years. Consider 2020 a hyperbolic example of this dynamic. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, stocks were enjoying their longest bull market on record. Then, as the virus gripped the world by mid-March 2020, markets started to experience great volatility. In fact, the average daily move for the S&P 500 was +/- 5%, even higher than at the height of the stock market crash of 1929. During this period, U.S. stocks experienced one of the quickest declines into bear market territory in history, losing -34% in a little more than one month’s time. But the swiftness and severity of the selloff was matched only by the strength of the market’s recovery: Stocks climbed back to their pre-crisis highs in just four months, and ultimately ended the year more than +16% higher.
1
Many market participants have been tempted to jump in and out of investments during bouts of volatility. However, even before 2020’s unprecedented market moves, the historical evidence shows that markets right themselves even after major disruptions. What’s more, it illustrates the difficulty of trying to time the market; get that timing wrong, and the consequences are significant.
Over the past 20 years, seven of the stock market’s 10 best days occurred within just 15 days of one of the market’s 10 worst days. If an investor missed those 10 best days because they were attempting to dodge the down days that surrounded them, their average annualized return amounted to +5.06%. But what if that same investor stayed invested throughout the entire period, taking the bad days with the good? Their annualized return was +9.24%— almost double that of the market timer.
2
The point is that in the long term, staying invested is a tried-and true strategy for growing wealth over time.
Focus on yourself, not the markets
Research suggests that making decisions based on short-term market movements actually diminishes returns. DALBAR’s annual Quantitative Analysis of Investor Behavior shows the S&P 500’s 20-year annualized return was 9.52%, while the average equity mutual fund investor saw only a 8.13% return on the same basis. That 1.39% difference is often attributed to investors reacting to the markets.
3
Indeed, there is ample evidence from the field of behavioral finance finding people tend to react to markets in a way that lowers returns.
4
Many investors tend to “buy high” and “sell low,” which can cause them to “churn and burn” their portfolios.So how can we avoid decisions that might lead to poor outcomes, and instead position ourselves for success? Reframing financial decision making is a crucial starting point. Rather than reactively focusing on elements that are
out of our control
—markets, economies, policymakers and the like—we can instead proactively focus on elements that we can control.
What is your money’s job?
There are a number of factors within your control, but perhaps the most critical component in every wealth strategy is this: explicitly identifying the primary purpose, or intent, for your money. In other words, what job do you want your money to do for you? When your decision-making process serves the primary intent for your wealth, you have a guidepost to understand what actions to take, given market (or other) events.
Imagine young entrepreneurs in their early 30s with no children. The couple wants to provide for their lifestyle after they sell their business. They have many working years ahead of them and no intention of using their investments for decades. For them, market volatility may be largely irrelevant. Why? They are more able to wait out ups and downs, ultimately taking advantage of potential investment returns over multiple decades.
Now imagine the same couple, but they are currently in their 60s. They have three adult children and no source of income outside of their investment portfolio. They not only need to sustain their spending, but also would like to provide for family members. In addition to revisiting their portfolio risk level, they may want to consider factors that go far beyond investment decision making.
For example, how long do they want the money they give to their family to last—within the children’s lifetimes or well beyond? Given these goals, what would be the most tax-efficient way to give to their family? Would they have enough to maintain their lifestyle, given their needs and desired level of giving? These considerations may necessitate a dialogue with professionals about wealth structuring, investing, borrowing, income and estate tax considerations—and more. Identifying a primary intent moves a focus on investments to the broader purpose of wealth, which can help you align your overall wealth strategy and decision making with the individual’s or family’s goals.
Taking a goals-based approach
To have your money work toward your goals, it helps to identify with one of four “foundational intents” for wealth.SPEND:
To support your lifestyle goals with the assumption that all wealth will be spent in your lifetime.
Spending all of your wealth during your lifetime can be by choice (e.g., “I’d like to bounce my last check”), or by necessity (e.g., “I feel that I may not have enough during my lifetime based on my current spending”).
People attracted to this approach are often interested in generating income to achieve a certain lifestyle, or educating children and/or grandchildren.
Many people believe this intent is the easiest to manage. However, there are many risks in attempting to achieve a zero balance sheet at the end of life; it’s easy to over- or underspend. Just think: Would you be comfortable using equity in your home now if you unexpectedly lived to 100?
These continuous risks make stress-testing and contingency planning essential.
DIVIDE
:
Identify a set amount of money either to create a minimum wealth level or to leave to beneficiaries.
Many people who focus on division are interested in “keeping it simple” with respect to the path their wealth will take at the end of life. Why? Some feel they want beneficiaries to have complete control over the money they receive, or it feels like too much effort to create a “trust and estate plan.” Others are reluctant to discuss their wealth or aren’t ready to commit to gifting to the future recipients. The key focal point is that the wealth goes to the intended place, and that the plan is reviewed on an annual basis—especially later in life when preservation can become more appealing. For example, when gifts become larger than anticipated, there may be a greater focus on sustaining the wealth for third and fourth generations. Also, it can be more apparent whether family members are psychologically ready to productively receive wealth and what governance may or may not be needed.
PRESERVE:
To create a strategy and family culture that enable wealth to last through multiple generations.
The desire to preserve wealth across generations can be enormously complex. To support an estate plan that preserves your assets, it is essential to consider your family culture and dynamics.
Promoting a positive family culture to foster the stewardship of wealth may require answering challenging questions such as: When are trust distributions so large they risk stifling the beneficiary’s growth and development? The answer lies beyond just dollar amounts. It also depends on communicating with beneficiaries about financial values, accountability and governance.
The key to successfully preserving wealth often depends on how well you align a wealth strategy and structure with your family culture. It can be very helpful to have the ongoing advice and support of advisors familiar with successfully transferring wealth across generations.
GROW:
To create a strategy and family culture that enable wealth to grow in perpetuity (often via a family business or pooled family investments).
Perhaps the most complex of the four intents, a growth intent requires multigenerational succession plans, as well as business and wealth strategies that are truly owned and governed collaboratively by family members. Even the best laid-out approach can end in very public and painful family disputes, making predefined exit strategies essential.
A key starting point can be to identify whether your family has the human infrastructure (i.e., family members who also have a desire to grow) to support this path for your wealth.From awareness to action
Establishing a primary intent—whether it be Spend, Divide, Preserve or Grow—can empower you to reframe financial decision making. It can motivate you and your family to collaborate, and help your professional advisors work with you to answer such critical questions as:
Do I have just enough, more than enough or not enough to achieve my primary intent?
Establishing the resources available—now and in the future—to serve your or your family’s intent is critical. If there is not enough, working to adjust the necessary levels of cash flow can help get you back on track. If there is just enough, continual monitoring of the situation may be essential. If there is more than enough, perhaps you may want to explore additional goals or opportunities.
Who should be involved in the financial decision making, and when?
Establishing a group of decision makers and a culture that can support your desired intent is also important. For example, if family members don’t know they will be receiving large amounts of wealth, they may not have the information or tools to successfully steward the money or a family business across multiple generations. Working with professionals to communicate the right amount of information at the right time can help you or your family achieve the desired outcomes.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Are we always rational about money? When we think about money, the value we assign to it may not always align with our intentions.People across the globe may find it empowering to organize their money in four buckets: liquidity (cash), lifestyle (spending), legacy, and perpetual growth. In this way, they discover whether their money is organized—and utilized—in a way that supports their intentions.Money.
It’s a tricky concept in many ways, introducing both opportunities and challenges. When we think about money, we often think in terms of different “mental” accounts. In other words, we assign different values to, and uses for, money based on a variety of factors, including where it came from and what we intend to do with it. Is this an opportunity, a challenge or some combination of the two? Let’s take a look.…
Think about this scenario: Imagine that you have bought tickets to a movie or a Broadway show. When you arrive at the theater, you can’t find the tickets. You rummage through your phone, bag and pockets, but they’re nowhere to be found. What do you do?
Do you grab your credit card and buy new tickets or just go home?
Now imagine another scenario: You have not bought any tickets and instead arrive at the theater with a set amount of cash that you’ll use to buy them. When you arrive, you dig into your pockets (or purse) and cannot find the cash. What do you do?
Do you grab your credit card and buy the tickets or just go home?
Research has shown that people are
much more willing
to purchase the tickets after losing the money (in the second scenario) relative to losing the tickets (in the first scenario). Rationally speaking, there should be no difference—in both situations, the same amount of money was lost, and the decision to purchase the tickets (or not) should be the same. But this is where mental accounts come in. In the first case, it feels like you’re “double paying” for the tickets (which many people don’t like to do), whereas in the second it seems that you are only paying once (because you lost money, not tickets).
To apply this lesson to your own life, think about how you assign your money to different mental accounts. Do you use monetary gifts differently from an identical amount of money earned at a job? Does a tax refund serve a separate purpose than it would if the money had not been withheld for taxes? Do you spend or invest your bonus in a way that is distinct from how you spend or invest your salary? Do you have “play” money and “safe” money?
From mental accounts to physical ones
When you consider all of your mental accounts—the sources of your money, and how that may cause you to use the accounts differently—do you feel that your mental accounting is helping you use money in the most productive way? One way to find out is to establish a physical framework, or “buckets,” for your money that you
know
will be productive. You can then regularly review that framework to see if your money behaviors truly align with what you’re trying to accomplish.Liquidity (cash) bucket
People look to have enough money on hand to feel psychologically safe through the ups and downs of markets, business cycles and life events. We want to be sure that our spending or lifestyle will not be unexpectedly restricted or cause us to sell assets at exactly the wrong time (i.e., sell low). Within the liquidity bucket, we want to have enough operating cash for typical lifestyle expenses (1-5 years), taxes, big purchases, business expenses and the like. Many people also say they like to have “dry powder” available for opportunistic, attractively priced investments (so when others are selling low they can buy low).
How much liquidity, or cash, do you have on hand? Is it providing you the freedom to do what you’d like when you’d like to do it?
This bucket might include actual cash in your safe, deposits, short-duration fixed income (bonds) and money market accounts. Securities-based lines of credit or equity in a home (accessed through home equity lines of credit, for example) can also be thought of as sources of liquidity.
Lifestyle (spending) bucket
Many people want to bucket money in a “lockbox” strategy that they hope will reliably provide for their lifestyle needs and wants for the rest of their lives. So, if anything were to happen—if, for example, they faced a large loss of capital in a business or concentrated investment, or a life event that left the principal earners unable to work—there would be money set aside that would allow for a comfortable life. The contents of this bucket are specifically tailored to an individual or family’s definition of lifestyle. It could include everything from spending on essential needs to educational funds for children and grandchildren, to gifts in life for the family and the community.
Do you have a bucket of money set aside for your lifestyle? If so, is it enough? Too much?
Often this bucket can include stocks, mid- and longer-duration fixed income (bonds), cash (to replenish the liquidity bucket regularly) and diversified alternative investments (including private equity and hedge funds). Learn more about the lifestyle bucket
here
.
Legacy bucket
While the first two buckets hold money set aside for use within one’s lifetime, another bucket contains money meant to be used beyond one’s lifetime. But there’s some flexibility here. If the lifestyle bucket is drained too early due to factors such as longevity (what if you live to 105?), the legacy bucket can provide a minimum level of wealth. In addition, this bucket may be intended for family gifts—either outright or via more complex wealth planning structures—as well as philanthropic gifts via donor-advised funds (DAFs) or family foundations.
What are your intentions—if any—use your money to benefit people or organizations beyond your lifetime?
Nearly a quarter of our clients have said they have no intention of leaving money to others beyond their lifetimes, which may mean this bucket isn’t relevant to you. (See
The power of intent
for more information about what clients say they intend to do with their money). But if it is, what does your legacy bucket look like?
A wide range of strategies can be effective here: life insurance, trusts, complex wealth structures, general investments, home, art, jewelry and more. People sometimes choose to borrow against assets in this bucket (for example, art) in order to supply money to fill other buckets (such as lifestyle). Learn more about the legacy bucket
here
.
Perpetual Growth bucket
It’s important to note that the contents of the first three buckets—liquidity, lifestyle and legacy—are meant to be consumed. The fourth and final bucket has a different purpose altogether. It’s meant to provide capital growth in perpetuity. Assets in the perpetual growth bucket are typically accompanied by a clearly articulated succession plan (e.g., via a business or family office) in which growth assets are meant to be stewarded by future generations.  Given the infrastructure and decision making systems required to successfully grow capital in perpetuity, this is a bucket that is not undertaken lightly.
Do you have money that is meant to grow forever? If so, how much? And have you communicated that with the people or organizations that are meant to steward that wealth?
Typically, this bucket includes long-term investing strategies that are more aggressive (e.g., private equity, public equity and hedge funds), concentrated positions or investments, businesses and investment real estate (typically not family residences). Borrowing to enhance investment returns (“levered” investments) may also fit in this category. Learn more about the perpetual growth bucket
here
.
Aligning buckets with your intentions
After you’ve identified the buckets that may apply to you—as well as what and how much is in each of those buckets—challenge yourself to identify what those buckets
should
look like. To do this, try to think through the various goals that would align to each of your buckets.  A goal has four fundamental pillars: a desired dollar amount, time horizon, priority level and a label.This matters because different buckets with different amounts, time horizons and priority levels will have different sizes and wealth strategies. Let’s take lifestyle as an example. For a 40-year-old who has a lifestyle goal to spend $500,000 per year starting at 65, that strategy may look very different than it will when the same individual is 65 and already spending $500,000 a year from the lifestyle bucket. And the composition of the assets in the bucket may be completely different when that individual is 90 and spending the same amount. In particular, the strategy is likely to be invested in less risky assets over time, for a variety of reasons—not least because the need for cash flow becomes more essential when money can’t be earned through activities such as work. A more conservative mix may be required to ensure that the required $500,000 cash flow is actually realized.
And depending on when the individual started filling the lifestyle bucket, the amount that must be dedicated to that bucket may vary quite a bit. If an individual started investing at 40 for her future lifestyle needs, she would typically dedicate much less to the bucket than if she started later, because the compound growth of investments would be on her side. So—no matter what your wealth level or stage in life—the time to start identifying the time horizons, money amounts and priority levels of your buckets is
now
so that you can align strategies to get where you want to go. Here’s an example of how $1 million might be allocated differently depending on these factors.From awareness to action
Aligning your intentions with your wealth strategies is an ongoing process. And it can start at any point in time—whether you are early, mid or late stage in your journey with wealth. The strategies that serve your various goals, or buckets of wealth, may also evolve over time. For example, when you’re younger you may not want to lock in a strategy that allocates resources for future generations. Perhaps you’re not certain of how much wealth you will accumulate or you may not have identified to whom or how much you’d like to give, if anything at all. But as you get older, you may transition to more irrevocable wealth structures as you gain more clarity about the dollar amounts you can and want to give to your family or community. Whatever your intentions, get started. Move your mental accounts to physical ones. When you formally identify the buckets of money that you have and align those buckets with your intentions, you can have much greater confidence in your wealth strategy. The example below illustrates how a certain amount of capital may be aligned to your wealth strategies to serve your various goals.With confidence, you’ll be able to directly address some basic but important questions: Where, exactly, is my money? Is it doing what I want it to do? Will I have enough in a crisis? Will my wealth have the intended effect on my family? Explicitly bucketing your wealth, making mental accounting physical, can also help answer these questions over time. This can in turn give you the peace of mind that your wealth is having its intended impact.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Your strategy may be sound, but it may need some adjusting. Here’s how to plan for your spending needs in any market cycle.At a certain wealth level, the idea of “budgeting” may no longer be relevant. So let’s say right off the bat—this is
not
an article about budgeting. Instead, we discuss how you can plan for your lifestyle spending so that you can move forward confidently in all aspects of your financial life.
Even if you have more than enough money to support your lifestyle, it’s important to establish your annual spending number in order to set yourself up in other areas, like leaving a legacy for your family or growing your assets in perpetuity. Understanding your annual cash flow needs is the first step in defining your lifestyle “bucket” so that you can set aside resources and invest it appropriately to meet the spending needs and wants that you and your family will have over the course of your lifetimes. The lifestyle bucket is one of four in a goals-based plan (the others are liquidity, legacy and perpetual growth). To learn more about the bucket framework, see
here
.
Bear in mind, this lifelong spending bucket is entirely separate and distinct from
the liquidity bucket
. That covers operating cash flow, near-term big ticket purchases and opportunistic investments, while allowing you to sleep well at night. Funding the liquidity bucket comes first.
In contrast to a liquidity bucket, a lifestyle bucket contains long-horizon financial and investment resources—set aside in a “lockbox” strategy.
Here’s how you can be deliberate and intentional in setting up a lifestyle bucket for your family’s financial life. We’re including a framework to help you get started, questions to think through and strategies that may be well aligned with your needs.
Components of your lifestyle bucket
The overarching purpose of a lifestyle bucket is to help provide a strong foundation for financial security. If, for example, you were faced with a large loss of capital in a business or concentrated investment, or suddenly became unable to work—you’d have money set aside to allow for a comfortable life.
So what actually makes up lifestyle spending? These three categories can help you identify your lifestyle needs:
Spending for yourself:
Food and dining, clothes and other luxury items, real estate carrying costs and household staff, travel, ongoing large purchases—the nuts and bolts of daily life.
Spending for your family:
Gifts to family members, tuition for children and/or grandchildren, wedding expenses, upkeep of the family’s summer home
.
Spending for your community:
Community-minded gifts such as donations to your alma mater or religious organization, or other charitable commitments and philanthropic bequests.
Questions to ask yourself
When you make a goals-based plan, you’ll want to think through the various goals that align to each of your buckets. Keep in mind that each goal has four components: a desired dollar amount, time horizon, priority level and a label.
Here are some questions you can ponder to arrive at the specific goals within each lifestyle spending group.
Spending for yourself:
How much cash do you need for essential and discretionary expenses? Is an expense truly discretionary, or do you really consider it as non-negotiable for your family? Do you have a buffer included for the “one time” expense that typically pops up on an ongoing basis? (We all seem to have this one; it might be a new car one year, home renovations the next, etc.) Do you anticipate any significant changes to your lifestyle needs over time? How certain do you want to be that you can provide for these expenses?
Spending for your family:
Are there any goals related to family members or loved ones that you view as effectively part of your lifestyle needs? Children’s or grandchildren’s education costs? Healthcare expenses for an aging parent or adult child with special needs? When will these outlays start, and how long will they last? Are you willing to adjust any of these goals, either in dollar amount or duration?
Spending for your community:
Do you have any ongoing charitable giving that you consider part of your lifestyle? This might include gifts to your religious organization or alma mater, or a cause or philanthropic organization that is important to you. When will these gifts start, and how long will they last? Will the giving amount be constant, or will it change over time?
Let’s get specific. Here’s an example of how you might align capital from your overall portfolio to fund your lifestyle bucket:Choices and decisions: Time horizon and risk tolerance
Once you have created your lifestyle bucket, it’s time to make some decisions. How will you treat the assets within the lifestyle bucket? You can choose among a range of products and strategies across banking, investing, planning and lending. Your time horizon (when you need these resources and how long they need to last) and your own risk tolerance will determine which strategies make the most sense for you.
For instance, if you’ll be investing with a long time horizon, taking measured, appropriate risk likely makes sense. But if you’ll need large portions of the lifestyle bucket in the near future, dialing down that risk and becoming more income focused may be a critical consideration.
Be mindful of the account types and which account to place each investment in as you consider this bucket. Maybe you have a blend of accounts that have differing tax treatments and degrees of access (personal accounts versus retirement accounts versus trusts, etc.). You want to make sure you can access the resources aligned with these goals when you need them, and without adverse tax consequences.
Finally, follow these steps to keep track of your lifestyle bucket and avoid potential disruptions. First, consider how often you’d like to review your lifestyle bucket—and determine how you’ll assess if the amount set aside needs to be adjusted (up or down) as your priorities shift and life evolves. Second, if you are still earning income and your lifestyle relies on that income, consider taking out a life insurance policy. Lastly, for spending related to family members, contemplate how you’d like to communicate with them, before allocating resources, to ensure a sense of procedural fairness (an education spending policy, for example).
Final thoughts
Going through the process of articulating your lifestyle bucket can be enlightening.
Maybe you discover you’re spending too much or too little relative to your wealth level. Maybe your plan is essentially sound, but needs just a little tinkering. Keep your eye on the ultimate goal: Make sure you have allocated enough money to your lifestyle bucket and are investing it appropriately—and in the optimal account types to meet your family’s lifetime spending needs so that you can move forward confidently in all aspects of your financial life. We believe our three-element approach—identifying spending for yourself, your family and your community—can help guide your thinking, and deepen your conversations with your family and trusted professionals.This chart provides an example to help articulate what’s in your lifestyle bucket. For instance, you can add up the capital needed (annually) for you and your spouse/partner (e.g., food, clothes), your family (e.g., college education), and your community (e.g., donation to alma mater) to calculate your total annual spend. How much do you need to set aside right now in order to spend with a high degree of certainty this amount per year for the rest of your life?Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.

In times like these when inflation is rising, it’s smart to make sure you have enough-- but not too much-- cash on your balance sheet.
Holding too much cash over the long term can be very detrimental. Because it’s universally true that inflation erodes the true value of cash over time. It eats away at your purchasing power.
But, still, some liquidity is needed and wanted.
How much should it be? And what form should it take?
There is no one answer for everyone.
GBA Overview
First you need to identify your near-term , your medium-term and your long-term goals.
Depending on what these goals are--- you will begin to know how much should be earmarked for four different purposes. Think of it as putting funds into four different buckets.
• The first is your LIQUIDITY BUCKET. Those are the funds you can access quickly to pay for ongoing operating expenses, large purchases and opportunistic ventures. It’s also the cash you have on hand to serve as a sort of psychological safety net.
The other three buckets contain funds to maintain your lifestyle, create legacy and ensure growth across generations.
All are incredibly important. But today we are going to focus on the liquidity bucket for two reasons:
• First, because inflation is higher now and erodes the value of your purchasing power over time. So you’ll want to make sure you have only as much cash as you need.
• Second, to get a handle on what you actually need, it helps to think through the purpose of your cash and other liquid assets.
1. Operating expenses
So let’s talk about what we see as the four purposes of liquidity.
Number 1, you need it to pay for your OPERATING EXPENSES: your “day to day.”
To determine how much you need—and want—for operating expenses, you’ll have to calculate your family’s current annual spending or “burn rate.”
How much does it cost to keep you and your family going in the everyday?  We’re talking about both your essential and discretionary expenses.
This is the cost of running your household, paying for the kids’ schooling, your family’s hobbies, entertainment, vacations and other fixed expenses.
We generally suggest that clients consider keeping on hand enough to cover one to five years of their annual burn rate. Everyone is different. But, typically, we see clients set aside three years’ worth of operating funds.
And we help them figure out how much, exactly, that really is.
Having this amount readily available can especially help in times like these, when markets are volatile.
It’ll help knowing that, even in a down market, you won’t have to sell parts of your investment portfolio to meet your lifestyle needs.
2. Psych safety net
Number Two – You want to figure out how much you want for your
PSYCHOLOGICAL SAFETY NET.
This is the amount of cash that you have readily available to help you sleep well at night.
For some clients it’s just $100K, for others it’s 500K, $1MM –- or even more.
This amount of money does not have to be committed to any purpose. You just have to make sure you can really afford to keep it relatively idle--off on the sidelines.
3.Large purchases
The third number you want to figure out when tallying up how much to keep in your liquidity bucket is how much you need for
LARGE PURCHASES
.
This is the reserve earmarked for any big expenditures or financial commitments you have in the near term.
So, for example, you may be planning to buy a new home, boat or car. You may not know when you want to make these purchases, but you do want enough on standby so you’re ready to make a move.
Or, you may want to make a large charitable donation, either directly or through a structured giving program such as a Donor-Advised Fund.
Often, we work with business owners and real estate developers who have had a significant liquidity event.  They may need to set aside funds for upcoming tax payments, which fall into this category as well.
4. Opportunistic uses
Last but not least is a category we think of as cash for
OPPORTUNISTIC USES
This is the “dry powder” you keep close at hand so that you are able to take advantage when compelling investment opportunities arise.
Especially now, as the economy slows and the prices of some investments and real estate start to drop, you may see an interesting opportunity and want to be able to capitalize on it.
Summation
Once a client has a better understanding of each of these categories—Operating Expenses, Psychological Safety Net, Large Purchases and Opportunistic Uses—we help them check what their final cash number should be in the context of their overall balance sheet.
The idea is to help them make sure they are allocating enough, but not too much, to their LIQUIDITY BUCKET.
Given how volatile markets have been and how fast inflation has been rising of late, we recommend that you go through this LIQUIDITY TALLYING EXERCISE soon. And that you plan to check your numbers again in about six months to a year.
Talk to your J.P. Morgan team so you can take advantage of our financial forecasting tools that stress test a variety of “what-ifs” around the appropriate amount of cash you might hold.  These tools allow you to “pre-experience” the short and long-term impact of holding different amounts of cash.
Conclusion
We also recommend that you take a good look at what you consider LIQUID.
Taking a moment to think through your needs and options can be fruitful. Clients even tell us it is liberating.
In these uncertain times, this is one way to help you gain an important measure of control.
We look forward to helping you make sure you have enough, but not too much, cash –and liquidity – on hand.",,,"

Your company stock position is the bedrock of your wealth.
However, if you won’t need the entire position to achieve your longer-term goals, more immediate—and strategic—opportunities may await you in the areas of family gifting, charitable giving and cash flow management. (Read
this
to determine if your concentrated position is more of a risk or an opportunity.)
Moreover, the strategies below are relevant for corporate insiders and individuals alike:
Gift to children
A concentrated position can provide a meaningful solution to achieving gifting objectives, such as leaving money to children—especially if you must continue to hold the concentration to satisfy issues of either public perception or ownership requirements.
Grantor Retained Annuity Trusts (GRATs)
GRATs can help you achieve multiple objectives; more so, if you have a single stock position and expect a substantial increase in its value:
Asset appreciation above a predetermined hurdle rate transfers to the next generation free of transfer tax
1
Shares held in the GRAT continue to count toward your ownership requirement, thereby satisfying issues of public perception. Plus, the act of entering into a GRAT may send a positive signal to the market
If the stock price declines, and the GRAT fails to pass appreciation to your heirs, you are no worse off than if you had continued to hold those shares on your balance sheet—except for the legal fees incurred to set up and administer the trust.
On the bright side: If the share price declines, you can create a new GRAT with shares at the depressed value, making it more likely that this second effort will be successful.
In the current environment, where the market has pulled back significantly and many companies have seen a decline in their stock prices, starting a GRAT may be especially effective.
Implementing a GRATIn this hypothetical example, a client put $5 million of company stock into a GRAT for a period of five years. The outcome was a success: During the period, the shares appreciated to an amount above what the client invested plus a hurdle rate, and the excess funds passed to the trust’s beneficiaries free of estate tax. As shown above, the rate of return was 10% and the hurdle rate was 3.6%. The net amount passing to the beneficiaries totaled $927,000. Assuming an effective transfer tax rate of 40%, this is equivalent to $370,800 of transfer tax savings.
Give charitably
Direct gifts and donor-advised funds (DAFs)
Many of the individuals we work with are
checkbook givers
(i.e., they give to charities every year, but mostly in the form of cash).
A far more tax-efficient strategy would be to gift appreciated long shares of public company stock. For those with a concentrated position, this technique can be even more powerful, allowing you to:
Receive a deduction for the market value of the gift
Avoid taxes on embedded gains of the position—a substantial savings
Diversify and dispose of the concentrated shares with the highest gain
There are two ways to use your concentrated stock for charitable giving: as a direct gift to one or more charities, or more easily, through a DAF (i.e., a charitable investment account set up for the sole purpose of supporting certain charitable organizations).
2
Importantly, with a DAF, you receive the tax deduction in the year you make the transfer. However, you don’t need to make charitable distributions from the account in the same year, increasing its flexibility as a charitable giving vehicle.
For corporate insiders, public opinion generally favors transfers made to charity over personal sales, though you should take care to make any gifts to charity during open window periods when they are not in possession of Material Non-Public Information (MNPI).
3
Enhance your cash flow
There are ways to use a concentrated position to increase your cash flow and at the same time support both your short- and long-term objectives.
Charitable Remainder Trusts (CRTs)
Setting up a CRT is a tax-efficient way to diversify out of the concentrated position while maintaining strong cash flow, as follows:
Transfer a portion of your concentrated position to the trust, which can immediately sell the shares and reinvest the proceeds in a diversified portfolio—without you having to immediately recognize the tax bill
Enhance your revenue stream with regular taxable payouts from the trust over a pre-set period, typically 20 years or more. This essentially allows you to spread out the tax liability of the concentration over many years
Receive a charitable deduction upon creating the CRT for the forecasted remaining assets, which will go to charity
As with any strategy, there are caveats and concerns to weigh. For example, as an insider, you likely would not consider this strategy until you separated from your company.
Borrow against your position
If you plan to hold on to your public company stock, you likely can lend against the position. This would allow you to maintain your position while funding other goals.
However, before you implement this strategy, carefully evaluate the amount to borrow as well as the potential for margin calls if the stock declines in value.
If you are a company insider, also carefully review regulations governing the pledging of shares and whether or not certain public disclosures are required.
We can help
Concentrated positions have many caveats and nuances, especially for company insiders. Your J.P. Morgan team can help you evaluate how implementing one or more of these strategies may help you achieve your long-term goals.
1
Pursuant to Internal Revenue Code 7520, the interest rate for a particular month is the rate that is 120 percent of the applicable federal midterm rate (compounded annually) for the month in which the valuation date falls. That rate is then rounded to the nearest two-tenths of one percent.
2
There are implications to gifting under Rule 144 for the donor (assuming that the donor is a Rule 144 affiliate). The donor is obligated to aggregate, for purposes of the volume limits of the rule, all of their own sales with those of all of the donees for a period of six months (reporting companies) or one year (nonreporting companies) following each gift. The donor must aggregate all sales during the six-month/one-year period following the gift with all donees’ sales of securities during the three months preceding the donor’s sales.
3
Corporate insiders who have to report all of their transactions in company stock typically are able to file a single Form 5 at year-end for charitable gifts instead of a Form 4 at the time of the transfer, thereby making the reporting less onerous. On December 15, 2021, the SEC proposed amendments to 10b5-1 and disclosure for Executive Officer Equity Grants and Gifts. Historically, Section 16 insiders have been permitted to report gifts of securities on a delayed basis on a Form 5 due within 45 days following the issuer’s year-end. Motivated by concerns that the delays in reporting gifts under Section 16 create the potential for abuse regarding the timing and valuation of such gifts, the SEC has proposed that any gift by a Section 16 insider must be reported on Form 4 within two business days of the gift.This graphic shows a hypothetical example of a client putting $5MM of company stock into a GRAT for a period of five years. Grantor transfers $5MM to the GRAT and pays no gift tax. Five annual annuity payments will be distributed to grantor, totaling $5.62MM with a present value of $5MM. The grantor pays tax on the income and capital gains realized by GRAT assets. After the GRAT ends, any remainder passes to beneficiaries or to a continuing trust for their benefit, free of gift tax.Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.

https://privatebank.jpmorgan.com/gl/en/insights/investing/market-thoughts/we-have-never-seen-a-cycle-like-this-before,"Economy & MarketsMarket Thoughts: We've never seen a cycle like this beforeauthors:- Richard Madiganpublished Date:- Nov 14, 2022Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.
Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Here’s how we’re navigating the uncertainty—and what we expect to see next.I struggle to point to a prior moment as proof statement for why policy rates shouldn’t be higher. They need to be. We’ve never seen anything quite like this cycle before.
Monetary policy acts with a lag. First, we see a tightening in financial conditions. That’s followed by a slowdown in economic activity. Finally, we’ll see inflation durably move lower.
Over the next few quarters, I expect global earnings expectations to be revised down by analysts. Companies have been able to pass along rising input costs so far. Those days are behind us.
Investors haven’t capitulated on markets. Concern can creep into the market narrative if risk assets fully round trip the past few years. That will take time for investors to emotionally process.
It’s the destination that matters.
The best I can say about inflation is that it remains stubbornly high. It’s going to take additional data to confirm we’re transitioning from peak inflation. The strategy for the Federal Reserve (Fed), European Central Bank (ECB) and Bank of England (BoE) is to continue to front-load tightening. They’re moving assertively to slow and then stop hiking at some point next year.
Central banks will begin to rein in the size of rate hikes. Ultimately, it’s the destination not the pace of rate hikes that matters. For all the wishful thinking that a policy pivot is coming, Jay Powell reiterated after the November Fed policy meeting that peak policy rates are higher from here.
While central banks will continue to raise rates into next year, my sense is the BoE and ECB will be forced to pivot sooner than the Fed. A policy pivot isn’t a pause or slowing the pace of rate hikes, it’s a change in direction. We’re a long way away from that happening.
We’re likely to remain in a ‘stronger-for-longer’ dollar environment. That will weigh on the U.S. earnings outlook and while it’s constructive for European exporters, it’s too early to lean into Europe. We remain underweight European equity markets in multi-asset portfolios. We’re overweight the U.S. as we believe international equity markets have greater relative downside.
Like inflation, I hope we’ll soon see ‘peak’ dollar. If we get another marked move higher, it will weigh further on the global economy. It will keep inflation higher for longer (Figure 1). For emerging markets, it may be the catalyst that tips sentiment lower, adding to concern of rising default risk.We’ve never seen anything quite like this.
I struggle to point to a prior moment as proof statement for why policy rates shouldn’t be higher. They need to be. Especially in the U.S., where labor markets—not to mention personal consumption and individual balance sheets—remain well supported in the face of Fed tightening. We’ve never seen anything quite like this cycle before.
There is no prior game plan to point to and learn from. To a large degree, that is creating the unwavering uncertainty investors continue to feel. It has left market moves explosive and shifted investor activity to trend following and day trading. I believe that’s the market environment we’re going to be in for a bit longer, as wearying as that is to hear.
Both unemployment and policy rates will move higher. Operating margins will return to lower trend levels as earnings forecasts are taken down by analysts. I don’t believe it’s fully appreciated how protracted the transition to lower inflation will be. Or how bumpy. Are we there yet? No, we’re not.
Keeping at it.
Jay Powell has said repeatedly the Fed intends to ‘keep at it’ until the job of fighting inflation is done. He continues to channel his inner Paul Volcker. Paul Volcker’s memoir, released a year before his death in 2018, is entitled:
Keeping At It
. It is well worth the read.
Inflation is a threat to growth and central banks are playing hard to counter it (Figure 2). Mario Draghi’s ‘whatever it takes’ remark about the euro in the European financial crisis has taken on new meaning, not just for the ECB, but for the Fed and BoE as well.Monetary policy acts with a lag. First, we see a tightening in financial conditions. That’s followed by a slowdown in economic activity. Finally, we’ll see inflation move lower. But it’s too early for central bankers to be talking about a pivot to cutting policy rates.
The Fed has made clear the greater risk they see is pausing tightening too soon. Taking their foot off the policy brake early might entrench inflation as consumers then expect inflation to be a more lasting problem. Expectations matter and so far, long-term inflation expectations remain in check.
If the Fed overreaches in cumulative tightening, it will force a hard economic landing. In the process, it will have gained the ability to cut rates if needed. Our base case for a soft landing continues to hold, though the glide path to getting there has narrowed.
I can as easily make a case for 10-year U.S. Treasury yields making a run to and through 4.5% as I can a retracement back to or below 3.5%. The interesting thing is I see both happening over the course of the next year. That leaves us neutral on duration. If interest rates press markedly higher, our bias is to lean into core bonds and add to duration.
Keep calm, carry on.
The volatility we’ve seen across government bonds and foreign exchange markets has been some of the most severe I’ve seen since the European debt or global financial crisis. I don’t believe we’re heading into a similar environment, but volatility like this usually brings a few market casualties.
I’m surprised we haven’t seen more flash points given high correlations and heightened volatility. If we continue to see these types of market moves, investors will become more skittish. That’s likely to put increasing focus on liquidity and the return of capital, at the expense of price and return on capital.
With market volatility at punishing levels, I’m waiting to see where the next de-leveraging backdrafts appear. I’m keeping a close eye on more aggressive direct and private credit lending markets. Like SPACs, there have undoubtedly been mispriced and badly reserved loans extended at the recent ‘cheap money’ peak. As liquidity is drained, I expect we’ll see a few flash-crashes.
I’m also watching foreign exchange markets. It’s been ‘obvious’ coming into this year that the Fed was going to do the heavy lifting relative to other developed market central banks in rate hikes. The yen, euro and sterling have been ‘safe bets’ to use as a funding source for leveraged carry trades.
While I believe dollar strength continues for a few more quarters, given the moves lower we’ve seen this year in the yen, euro and sterling it’s time to begin to trim back shorts (Figure 3). The easy money has been made. Greed isn’t good when you’re caught on the wrong side of a carry trade and your funding source rallies.There is rising concern as storm clouds continue to darken across global markets. And yet, the world keeps spinning.
I expect companies will continue to highlight a more difficult operating environment and a more defensive outlook. We’re already seeing that.
There is no reason for heroics. While job openings remain strong, we are seeing them being pulled as global PMIs signal weaker activity ahead. We are also beginning to see job layoffs, particularly in the technology sector. We’ll probably see more ahead.
We’ve reduced our equity overweight this year to neutral as storm clouds gathered. First, in the form of far stickier inflation than we expected. We got inflation wrong early this year. Knowing that, we quickly began to pull back risk. As the facts change, you change portfolio positioning. If I look at the equity risk reductions we’ve made this year, we’ve been targeted in when we’ve pulled back – selling into moments of market strength.
We continue to bounce around a 15-18x multiple trading range on the S&P 500. We’re hovering around average historic valuation levels. A mean reverting market happens when investors aren’t sure if the next breakout should be higher or lower. It signals uncertainty. Equity markets are lower, not cheap.
Earnings remain important to watch. I expect we’ll see earnings revised lower over the next few quarters. Companies have been able to pass along all (if not more) of their rising input costs. That’s been a strong driver of operating leverage and outsized earnings growth (Figure 4). Those days are behind us.Slow-walking new investment.
Investors haven’t capitulated on markets. I think rising concern may creep into the market narrative if risk assets fully round trip the wild ride we’ve been on the past few years. Should we broach December 2019 equity market levels, we will have hit ‘rewind’ on pandemic stimulus driven out-performance. That will take time for investors to emotionally process.
The equity market has been reasonably well supported in the face of negative headlines and significant pullbacks in the largest technology companies. A broad trading range for the S&P continues to hold. Downside has held to 3500, with upside I believe around 4000. If inflation continues to surprise to the upside, we may see a new market low. Hopefully the market low is behind us.
James Carville, political adviser to Bill Clinton, is known for two quotes. “It’s the economy, stupid” helped Clinton win the Presidency in 1992. The second remark, made in 1994 as the U.S. bond market was rioting as it is today, proves again to be prescient.
Carville, in watching the power of bond vigilantes demand a return to fiscal orthodoxy, quipped that if there was such a thing as reincarnation he wanted to come back as the bond market. In his words, because you can intimidate everyone. Bond markets lead, risk assets follow. We’re seeing that currently.
As bond yields move higher, I’m tempted to borrow Carville’s campaign slogan about the economy to put in context what markets will be hyper-focused on in the months ahead… it’s inflation stupid. I’m sure that’s how policymakers feel as they continue with their back-to-back rate hikes.
I’ve been asked what I think is similar or different about the current market cycle to other selloffs. This one is particularly passionate because it’s driven by the repricing of policy rates. Policy rates are the risk-free rate that helps price all markets. Investors haven’t seen something like this in decades. We have a challenging and choppy market setting ahead.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Some couples avoid talking about wealth. But frank conversations can bring you closer together.Erika Shaw, Family Governance Advisor
Natalie Staples, Wealth Strategist
Being in a committed relationship can change how you spend, save, invest and set priorities. But financial compatibility between two partners, whether married or not, is rarely achieved without exploring what money means to each of you and regularly revisiting that conversation as life evolves.
A critical first step is to agree to have honest discussions about how your experiences in the past may have shaped how you think and feel about money. Making your personal finances—past, present and future—an ongoing part of your life together can help you weather disagreements about money (which often represent deeper divisions over issues relating to values, respect or identity).
It’s never too late to align your values and financial decisions. Explore how to get the conversation started at any stage of your relationship.Financial togetherness generally begins with conversations about how you will manage your money in the years ahead.
It can be helpful to think about how past experiences have influenced your beliefs and behavior. For example, what did you learn about spending and saving from your parents or grandparents that colors the way you manage your money today? Similarly, what do you consider a good use of wealth--and what do you think is best avoided? Do certain money behaviors make you anxious or, alternatively, give you peace of mind?
Countless money decisions await every committed couple. The sooner you begin talking about your finances—and financial expectations—the better equipped you both will be to plan your future together. Start with the basics:
Having children
Is having children important to you both? Whatever you decide, long-lasting financial considerations—along with changes in your relationship dynamics, career choices and lifestyle needs—will likely follow. It’s critical to explore together your hopes and expectations. Similarly, if either one or both of you already has children, it’s important to share the details of any financial commitments and how they may change over time.
Setting financial goals
Agreeing on your top financial goals and aligning your saving and investment strategies accordingly can get your marriage off to a strong financial start. What does your current lifestyle look like, and how might that change in the future? Do you want to save for a down payment on a house? Are there any other large expenses on the horizon, such as a vacation or a car? Being specific about the timing, cost and priority of your financial goals can help you better align your current and future resources.
Saving and investing
Once you’ve envisioned what you want life together to look like, think through how you will work together to turn your dreams into reality. How much does each of you earn? How much will each of you contribute to these expenses? Do you each set aside a certain portion of your paycheck for savings or investing? What outlays will you cover separately and/or jointly? Do either of you have student loans, credit card debt or other financial liabilities that may impede your ability to buy a home, start a family or make certain career/life choices? Consider having an independent third party or financial advisor serve as a sounding board in your conversations.
Planning for family contributions
What resources, if any, do you expect each of your families to provide over the years? Will these be merged with, or kept separate from your joint assets?
In some cases, a premarital agreement may be needed to address financial issues that emerge in your conversations. For example, if:
One of you (or your family) is significantly wealthier than the other
One family owns a business and wants to retain control and/or avoid future conflict
Either (or both) of you has children or financial obligations from prior relationships
Agreeing on a financial plan that feels fair to both of you reduces the likelihood of conflict or resentment in the future.Once you've married or settled in together, balancing practical financial considerations with longer-term goals can help you live the life you want as a committed couple.
Anticipate the future
Think through how future life changes might impact your financial and non-financial lives. Are you going back to school? Changing careers? If so, how would your spending change?  If you are considering having children, how would you approach childcare and educational decisions? Do you expect to one day care for aging parents? Consider the traditions, values, and dynamics in your families of origin. What would you like to emulate or do differently? What will you do when disagreements arise? Set ground rules for conversations around money, which may include ongoing meetings.
Create/update estate plans
Each of you should have a will (and possibly, a revocable trust as well) that accurately reflect your intent for your assets and the terms of any pre- or post-marital agreements.
1
A complete plan will include powers of attorney for health care and property decisions. Among the things to consider as you plan:
How do you want the surviving spouse/partner—as well as your children (if any) and respective families—to benefit if one of you dies?
Who will serve as guardians for your children if something were to happen to both of you?
Who will serve as executor/trustee for each of you?
Who should make health care decisions for each of you if you cannot make them for yourselves or for each other?
How will you pay for healthcare if one of you suffers a catastrophic illness?
Creating a joint vision for the future together can provide clarity, purpose and a sense of security.
1
Provisions in a revocable trust can be altered or canceled by the originator/grantor of the trust, who will receive any income earned by the trust during their lifetime. At their death, trust property will transfer to the trust’s beneficiaries.Regularly reevaluating personal and financial milestones can help alleviate stress and build excitement about the future. Including children in these conversations, as appropriate, can add fresh perspective to conversations about money, and enhance younger family members’ understanding of the family’s resources and goals.
Revisit financial goals
At least once a year, review your shared financial goals and discuss how they may have changed. For example, have you bought a home and turned your focus to saving for children’s college education? Is there a business opportunity you want to fund? Taking time each year to make sure your cash flow and investments align with your goals will help you anticipate major life changes and prepare for them.
Explore giving strategies
Many couples become more intentional about giving as their wealth grows. Are there certain people or causes that are important to you? If so, implementing a formalized gifting strategy may help you save both on income and estate taxes. Discuss where your charitable priorities align—and where each of you  wish to support a cause of your own. Charitable giving can also be a great way to teach your children about why supporting certain causes and/or communities means so much to you, personally.
Review your estate plan and marital agreements, if any
Review your estate plan both periodically and following major life changes to determine whether or not it reflects your intent. For many couples, a life-changing moment occurs when children/grandchildren are born or become adults; when one or both partners retires; or you move. Additionally,  unforeseen circumstances may arise that cause a marital agreement to become unconscionable such as one spouse becomes ill and can no longer work and support themself.  In such instances—or if doubts and questions arise—consult with a local family lawyer or an estate planning attorney.
Protect important information
Keep important documents in a secure physical or digital location that both you and your partner can access. These should include recent income tax returns, social security numbers, online account usernames and passwords, personal balance sheet information, birth and marriage certificate, passports and key account numbers, such as for credit cards and household utilities. Transparency promotes trust and peace of mind.
It can be easy to lose track of your financial goals as you tackle careers and raise children. Setting aside time for financial planning conversations can keep you moving forward.Celebrate what the two of you have accomplished together—and begin planning for your next chapter. You may find that your priorities and the ways you want to spend your time are changing. How will you find purpose and satisfaction when you stop working? If there are differences, try to find a solid middle ground. If one of you is still working, discuss how you will manage different schedules and life rhythms. Among the many other things to consider:
Evaluate lifestyle choices
Where will you live?
If you will maintain residences in multiple jurisdictions, be sure to follow all legal protocols if you plan to claim residency for tax purposes in your new state. Additionally, consider speaking with an estate planning lawyer about putting your out-of-state home in a revocable trust, so that you will not be subject to probate in multiple states.
How will you spend your time once you stop working? Board memberships? Volunteer work? Time with family? Travel? Hobbies? Learning new skills? It can be both exhilarating and challenging to have the freedom to spend your time as you like. Setting personal/social goals can make life after work more satisfying. Many people find they spend more money in their first decade of retirement; often, because they give more to family. Expenses tend to decrease in the middle years of retirement, and increase again in later years, primarily due to healthcare and charitable giving.
How do you each feel about healthcare in retirement? Medicare eligibility begins at age 65; you will need interim healthcare coverage if you retire earlier. Enrolling in Medicare can be complex given the options you must choose from, so you may wish to seek professional assistance. Moreover, you may need new coverage for family members who were previously covered by your employer’s health plan during your working years. Finally, do you want to age in your own home or move to a retirement community that has nursing or assisted living capabilities should you need them?
Get organized
Would both partners feel empowered to make critical financial decisions in the event of a sudden death, incapacity, or other emergency? If not, it’s time to get organized, especially if only one of you handles the day-to-day finances. Make sure you both know where important records are kept, from which accounts bills are paid, and which trusted advisors to call upon to help you.
Consider your legacy
How do you want to be remembered? Do you want to contribute to the well-being of future generations of your family? Support your community or faith? Help sustain a charity or educational institution? Make sure your estate plans accurately reflect your wishes for the disposition of your assets after you are both gone.We can help

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.If you can afford to give away assets during your lifetime, giving to your heirs while you are alive has decided advantages.Brandon Ross,
Executive Director, J.P. Morgan Private Bank
Most people plan to distribute their assets after they die. However, the economics of gifting always favor transferring assets to your beneficiaries sooner rather than waiting until after your death.
If giving away assets during your lifetime won’t impinge on your lifestyle or compromise your overarching wealth goals, you may want to incorporate a lifetime gifting program into your estate plan—being mindful of changes in U.S. tax laws that may provide impetus to implement a plan sooner for maximum tax efficiency.
Your J.P. Morgan team can help you evaluate what’s right for your particular goals and planning purposes.
The economics of gifting
The two simplistic scenarios below illustrate the benefits of gifting sooner rather than later. To keep the math easy, we assume a parent can afford to give her child $5 million at any time:
Scenario 1: The mother waits to leave all her money in her will to her only child
The mother holds onto the $5 million, and over 30 years it grows to $25 million. When she dies, her estate benefits from the current $12.06 million estate tax exclusion available to the mother—but must pay estate taxes of 40% ($5.18 million) on the remaining $12.94 million. As a result, her daughter receives $19.82 million.
Scenario 2: The mother gives her child $5 million today
No gift tax is due on the $5 million transfer to the daughter, thanks to the $12.06 million exclusion allowed the mother. Over the next 30 years, the $5 million grows to $25 million. When the mother dies, the $25 million is not subject to estate taxes—because it is not in her estate. It’s in her daughter’s. The daughter therefore nets the full $25 million, which is $5.18 million more than in the first scenario. Notably, the mother could have made the gift into an irrevocable trust for the daughter, and the $25 million would not be in the daughter’s estate either.
Benefits to the benefactor
While the economics of gifting before death may move you to give away assets now, your feelings and generosity may be more compelling drivers for giving sooner rather than later. Giving to heirs during your lifetime provides benefits other than maximizing your family wealth. For example, gifting early may allow you to:
See the joy that your gift has brought your loved ones
Share in the enjoyment of what you value most with your family
Pass on your values to the next generation(s)—You can speak directly to your heirs about your hopes for their futures as well as share your expectations for how you’d like them to steward the wealth
See/test how an heir might handle a larger inheritance in the future
Choose who gets your hard-earned wealth
Pending tax law changes
The scheduled changes in tax law can reduce your choices for transferring your wealth and provide a powerful push for immediate gifting.
Federal law grants wealthy individuals a lifetime tax exclusion on the gratuitous transfer of assets. In 2022, this exclusion from the 40% gift and estate tax is $12.06 million ($24.12 million for married couples). The current law is scheduled to change at the end of 2025, with the exclusion amount set to be cut roughly in half. More precisely, that exclusion would drop to $5 million per individual, indexed for inflation starting from 2011, resulting in an exclusion amount expected to be between $6 million and $7 million. This decrease does not need further government action to take effect.
Consider your options
Before making any decisions about gifting, speak to your accountant or tax advisors. Your J.P. Morgan team can also help you and your outside advisors decide if taking steps now to reduce taxes is right for you in light of your long-range financial goals.Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Spending a standard 4% annually might put your portfolio at risk, given the prospect of lower investment returns and higher inflation.Once upon a time not long ago in the United States, the “4% rule” was a reasonable (albeit very general) rule of thumb for everyone (including the wealthy) planning their retirements. You probably could expect to spend around 4% of your assets annually and would be unlikely to run out of money during the rest of your years.
1
No longer. The financial planner who devised the “4% rule” has declared it invalid due to the lower returns and higher inflation all economists now see on the horizon.
We agree. It’s time to toss the 4% rule out the window, as spending that much every year might now lead anyone—yes, even those with great fortunes—to outspend their resources. Many don’t realize that the 4% rule of thumb is inclusive of any funds needed for taxes (i.e. you’re spending less than 4%), leading many to underestimate what they’ll need to support a lifestyle confidently.
This means a burning question remains: How much might we safely spend every year in retirement? Our analysis suggests the new number is likely to be around 2% to 3% on an after-tax basis (depending on complicating factors unique to each individual).
These numbers mean you need to earmark between 30% to 50% more assets to be confident you are setting aside enough to fund your lifestyle in retirement. It also means close attention needs to be paid to assure you’re set up for success. We suggest you:
Find out what, precisely, your safe spending rate in retirement might be (and how much of your balance sheet you will need to align to this goal)
Set your accounts up so that you can make the most out of all your funds
Here, we outline why everyone’s new number is likely to be somewhere between 2% and 3%; the complicating factors that can push an advisable annual spend rate higher or lower; and strategies designed to wring the most out of the assets you’ll use to fund your retirement.Why you need to plan now for an annual retirement draw of 2% to 3%
Bill Bengen, now himself retired, first devised the 4% rule in 1994, and this rule provided general guidance for many for decades. Essentially, his approach suggested that people should plan to spend 4% of their assets in the first year of retirement, then adjust that amount annually for inflation. According to Bengen, this method would have kept a retiree from running out of money in every 30-year period since 1926, even during the worst economic times.
2
However, economists at J.P. Morgan now expect significantly lower returns for the foreseeable future.
3
For example, while the S&P 500 earned on average 10% over the last 10 years, our Long-Term Capital Market Assumptions forecast it’ll be less than half that over the next 10. Of course, we’d rarely recommend an all-equity portfolio to fund a client’s
lifestyle goals
, but equities usually are a key component in any portfolio.
Along with smaller returns, you also should expect higher levels of inflation, which will reduce the purchasing power of your dollars. Of course, you also should consider taxes and their potential impact on investment gains in taxable accounts and withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts.
The bottom line for retirement spending, as we see it, would look something like this—no matter where on the wealth spectrum you may live:
Based on our analysis and using the assumptions made below, we believe it is likely that a 60-year-old with a $30MM taxable portfolio would run out of money if she spent 4% of her portfolio (i.e. $1.2MM) for the next 30 years.
Instead, our modeling shows, she’d be wiser to spend between $600,000 and $900,000 of her portfolio each year. Also, the more she spends annually, the more necessary it will be for her to invest in equities, which are more likely than most other investments to outpace inflation.For illustrative purposes only. Source: J.P. Morgan Private Bank as of August 11, 2022.
These spending rates and their associated probabilities of running out of funds are likely to hold generally true whether you have $3 million, $30 million, $300 million—or billions. The only real differences lie in the circumstances of your life.What’s your number? The answer lies in your details
As helpful as general guidelines might be, each person’s situation (and therefore their advisable retirement spending rate or resulting lifestyle assets needed) is unique.
Yours will be shaped by a variety of factors that can include:
1. Portfolio composition
—How much do you have in taxable versus tax-deferred (i.e., traditional IRA) versus tax-free (i.e., Roth IRA) accounts? If you have a concentrated position, you might need to earmark more to account for that risk so as to avoid jeopardizing your lifestyle. Perhaps you have a lot of embedded gains and will need extra funds to pay taxes when those are eventually sold.
2. Tax rates
—Your U.S. federal, state and local rates can matter, a lot. They certainly need to be taken into account.
3. Financial commitments
—A lower burn rate may be advisable if you have other financial commitments or aspirations beyond maintaining your lifestyle. For example, you may want to support family members outside your home, make a large purchase (such as a family vacation home), fund children’s or grandchildren’s educations, give to charity or engage in some other enterprise that requires financial outlay.
4. Additional resources
—A higher burn rate is probably comfortable if you have other, illiquid assets on your balance sheet (such as real estate with no debt on it) or perhaps can count on other family resources (trusts or inheritances) to act as a safety net.
5. Health
—Medical expenses, both expected and unexpected, can be a major factor influencing retirement spending, and they need to be carefully examined and, as much as possible, anticipated.
6. Life partners’ ages
—Both your and your partner’s ages will determine the number of years and rate of spending you’ll have in retirement. Very often, the larger a couple’s age difference, the more complicated the planning. Given current life expectancies, for a 65-year-old couple today, there is a 72% probability that at least one will live to age 90; and a 44% chance that person will live to be 95 years old.Make the most of your retirement funds
With more pressure on your portfolio to last, you’ll want to make sure you’re doing everything to
optimize the funds you do have
. It becomes that much more important, for example, to
:
• Look at where you hold investments (in taxable versus tax-deferred accounts)
• Properly sequence where you pull funds
• Harvest your tax losses
• Deploy integrated planning techniques (such as funding charitable gifts with appreciated stock)
• Use a line of credit to bridge lumpy cash flow so you don’t have to realize gains unnecessarily

.A 60-year-old with a $30MM taxable portfolio is likely to deplete her assets if she spends 4% of her portfolio for the next 30 years. This table shows the likelihood she runs out of money based on different spending rates and asset allocations across the 30-year timespan. If she spends 4% per year, she has between a 69-100% chance of running out of money across all asset allocations. However, if she spends 3% per year, she has only a 32-61% chance of running out of money depending on asset allocation. For 2%, she has a 1-5% chance. As spending increases, the more necessary it is to invest in equities to keep pace with inflation.Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Perhaps it’s time to write a “letter of wishes”—or to update a letter you already have in place.Summer family gatherings can create opportunities for you, as a parent or grandparent, to enjoy and maybe get to know the younger members of your family just a little better. It’s a good time to learn more about the jobs they hold, friends they’ve made, dreams they have—and more.
With this new understanding, you might be inspired to review your estate plan, will and trusts to see how you might help them.
Of course, you cannot change any irrevocable trusts you’ve already created (for the most part).
1
But you can offer substantial guidance to the trustee you appointed and, if you like, to the beneficiaries you hope to help by offering them a letter of wishes (also sometimes called a “statement of intent” or “family values statement”).
If you already have a letter of wishes in place for the trusts you’ve created, does it need updating? If you have not created a letter of wishes yet, is it time you wrote one?
What exactly is a letter of wishes? And how does such a letter relate to a trust?
A trust agreement is a formal document that is legally binding. That is why a good estate planning lawyer will advise you to make its terms fairly general. After all, neither you nor the lawyer drafting it can know precisely what situation the trustee and your beneficiary will be facing in the years to come when funds are being distributed.
So for example, many U.S. trust agreements will order trustees to provide for the “health, support, maintenance and education of beneficiaries.”
In contrast, a letter of wishes is not legally binding. This letter will travel alongside a trust agreement for as long as the trust exists. It is general guidance that you as a trust creator should offer to help the trustee to better understand your intentions, your values and perhaps your beneficiary.
This message can be for the trustee’s eyes only—or it can be open to your entire family. You decide.
For example, your letter can simply explain to a trustee what you meant by “education,” as one person’s idea of education might be a Ph.D. in economics, while another’s might be a yoga class.
Or your letter could be a wide-ranging philosophical statement.
One matriarch used her letter of wishes to convey her philosophy that beneficiaries should “take only what you need and pass the rest on.” Written more than 50 years ago and reread every year at the family’s annual meeting, the letter asks the trust’s beneficiaries to view themselves as stewards of the family fortune. The letter advises them to draw on trust funds only to help them with their lives’ basic building blocks and to feel responsible for conserving the trust assets for future generations.
The trust officer who handles this trust says that the annual reading of this letter is always a moving occasion: “This letter of wishes establishes a tone—setting expectations—and over the years, everybody has risen to the occasion. The family takes it extremely seriously. The letter of wishes helped create a strong family tradition.”
How do you create a letter of wishes?
Because we serve as a corporate fiduciary and are often named as trustee, we have seen many letters of wishes—and how effective they can be—across the world. Here’s a quick look at what a letter of wishes might say and do; as well as six recommendations on how best to create one.
Some letters of wishes run to 20 pages and sound like contracts; others read more like intimate family messages. Most are about two pages long and very straightforward.
If you think you might like to write—or update—a letter of wishes, we recommend that you:

We’ve seen a wide range of letters of wishes, and can offer you samples and templates you might find inspiring.
2.
Make sure your legal advisors write, or at least review, your letter of wishes.
You don’t want your letter to create unintended consequences.
3.
Write your letter with the understanding that it cannot change your original trust document.
The original trust document is a legal agreement that will take precedence.
4.
Keep in mind that your heirs might someday, somehow, see that letter of wishes.
Consider how a beneficiary might feel discovering in a letter of wishes that his parents were disappointed with his lifestyle and thought him incapable of handling his finances.
5.
Be practical: Consider your trustee’s ability to carry out your wishes.
Trustees often do not have enough daily contact to closely monitor behavior. If you feel such oversight may be necessary, speak with your estate planning attorney about other arrangements that might be made.
6.
Remember that simple letters of wishes, kept up-to-date, may serve your intentions best.
The simpler the language and suggestions, the less likely you may feel compelled to revise or amend your letter of wishes. It’s a personal choice. J.P. Morgan Wealth Advisors in Asia report that clients typically review and update their letters every two to three years. But, of course, once the trust creator passes, the last letter of wishes will stand. So it is very important to draft each one carefully, for the ages.
7.
Give your letter of wishes to the trustee.
It may seem obvious, but it must be said: Make sure your trustee has a copy of your most recent letter of wishes. Trustees generally like letters of wishes because whether your trustee is a global bank or uncle, you are doing them a favor by providing them with a letter of wishes so that they may more effectively carry out your intentions.
Popularity—across the world—is growing
Letters of wishes seem to keep growing in popularity. Maybe that’s because there are increasing numbers of sizeable multigenerational (even perpetual) trusts.
So if you would like to create your “message in a bottle” that can speak to distant generations, reach out to your J.P. Morgan team and ask them to help you and your estate planning lawyer craft your own, very personal, letter of wishes.

Except in very limited circumstances, a U.S. trust creator can’t change the terms of an irrevocable trust he or she has already created. The beneficiaries, the term of the trust and the circumstances under which trust assets can be distributed may be modified, but only by someone else and never in a way that takes away from beneficiaries’ rights they have under that trust instrument.Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.It’s not too soon to plan. Start by helping your student articulate their goals for the yearAs a new school year approaches, your teenage children may already be focused on the academic and social opportunities ahead. Helping them articulate their goals for the year now, before summer ends, can help them get ready for a new set of challenges.
In this context, also talking with them about wealth and financial planning can help deepen your students’ understanding of your family values and beliefs, as well as provide important insights into how family resources and knowledge can support their personal growth and development.
These three tips, rooted in behavioral science, can help you get started.
1. Embrace the “fresh start effect”
Like birthdays, anniversaries and other milestones on the calendar, the start of the school year provides a natural moment for you and your teenage student(s) to pause, reflect and set goals.
To take advantage of such moments, encourage your student to look back, envision the near future and plan for what’s ahead. It’s much like making New Year’s resolutions, but focused on opportunities in the academic year: New school or new subject matter? More independence? Greater financial freedom, such as a first credit card or investment account, or a larger allowance?
There are many ways for a student’s academic and social goals to intersect with family finances, depending on the age of your child. Building on those connections can help them see the steps they must take to achieve their goals, whether academic, social or financial. (Even if they appear to be more focused on peers or social media.)
Helpful tip: New tools at the right time
Will your teen need checking, savings and credit card accounts to successfully navigate the coming school year? If they don’t have them already, consider setting up one or more online accounts in their name.
Take advantage of the timing to talk with them about responsibly saving, spending and borrowing.
Your J.P. Morgan banking team can help you set up the accounts and introduce your student to the money management tools they will have at their disposal, including automated alerts and cybersecurity protections. Your team can also show you how to monitor your child’s transactions from your own digital devices.
2. Cultivate good habits
Students who rely solely on self-control to reach their academic—or financial—goals may ultimately find they fall short of the mark, especially in periods of high stress and attention depletion. That’s okay, and that’s normal.
It’s far easier to stick to a plan when an automatic system built on healthy habits is in place.
Encouraging your student to think carefully about their goals for the coming school year can be a powerful first step in achieving them.
We know they’re likely to be more successful (and less stressed) if they study a little bit every night for a Friday test instead of staying up all night on Thursday to cram. Similarly, if you’ve asked your teen to contribute to a planned ski trip over spring break, they’re more likely to have saved their share of the funds if they begin by Labor Day.
Start by explaining the reality: that without a clear savings plan, they are unlikely to put money aside each week to save for the ski trip. For example, they may forget or become distracted by other demands on their time and attention.
However, if they adjust their weekly spending and put in place automatic transfers of money to a vacation account, the desired outcome is much more likely.
This powerful learning experience can help make saving a lifelong habit—as well as translate into behavior that helps raise test scores and set career goals.
Helpful tip: The three-bucket strategy
Children of any age can learn how to manage the money they earn or are given by dividing it into three buckets:
One for money to
spend
on themselves now
A second in which to
save
for their future selves
And a third to
give
gifts or donations to others
In addition, showing your child that you use the same strategy to manage the family’s financial resources can help reinforce their behavior.
3. Consider opportunity costs
Time, money and effort are all precious—and finite—resources. When they’re invested in one thing, that necessarily means they won’t be available for another: A March ski trip precludes a March beach jaunt; taking a gap year before college means giving up first-year camaraderie with high school classmates; spending the weekly budget on concert tickets may wipe out dinner plans.
It’s an important—and often difficult—lesson for everyone to learn (i.e., it’s simply not always possible to have it all). And there is much you can do to help your child absorb this fact of life.
Of course, your student is not yet at the stage where they must put aside spending to save for retirement or buy a home. But they do need to learn that if they spend their time, effort and money on one thing—whether it’s an impulsive choice or a deliberate one—those resources may not be there for something else.
Helpful tip: Explain the tradeoff value
Opportunities to teach a child that tradeoffs are an inevitable fact of life come in many forms and should be seized whenever possible.
For example, when one client’s teenage son wanted to hang out with friends instead of joining a family “charity day,” his parents emphasized the value of making a tradeoff (i.e., a shared day of service was a unique and important opportunity for the family). As it turned out, the event sparked the son’s interest in group community service—something that he now organizes with the friends he wanted to hang out with in the first place.
As this client experience highlights, by patiently guiding your student’s decisions regarding how they spend their money, time and effort, it is possible to both reinforce your family’s values and help your child grow into a uniquely empowered individual of whom you can be proud.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.When it comes to decumulation, where should you pull assets from first?The shift from asset accumulation to asset decumulation
The time is finally here. You have been building up your portfolio balances for years and are finally ready to start deploying this wealth to help fund a new chapter in your life. Whether you’ll be turning to your investment portfolio as your main source of income or using it to supplement other funding sources, understanding how to prioritize which accounts from which to draw assets first can be critical from a tax perspective. This article explores a three-step approach to asset decumulation (the process of deploying accumulated wealth to fund your lifestyle) with a tax-efficient mindset.
Step 1. Develop a spending plan
Consider your intent for your wealth:
Where do you want your portfolio assets to end up over the long term? Do you want or need to increase your wealth, even if it means scaling back spending? Do you want to preserve principal? Are you comfortable with a partial or even total drawdown of your wealth? Establishing your primary intent can help empower your financial decision making about spending and lifestyle goals.
Learn more
about the power of intent.
Understand your spending needs:
First, think through the areas of your life that you will need to fund. Major categories can include lifestyle, health care, travel, education costs or gifts for family members and charitable giving. Also consider how these expenses may change over time.
Learn more
about building a lifestyle bucket to help fund your lifestyle needs and wants over your lifetime.
Have a plan in case of disruptions:
Consider how market events might affect your short-term spending approach in any given year. This could be from a steep decline in asset prices or some other major economic disruption.
Learn more
about how a liquidity bucket may help avoid disruptions.
Step 2. Determine your funding sources
Non-portfolio income:
Now that you have a spending target, calculate how much you can expect in annual non-portfolio income. This can include “guaranteed income” streams, such as Social Security, pensions and annuities. Are there ways to optimize these sources? For example, does it make sense to delay starting to take Social Security to maximize your benefits? Other sources of non-portfolio income may include deferred compensation, consulting income, real estate income, trust distributions and more.
Your annual withdrawal target:
Your total non-portfolio income may not cover your entire spending target, and you will need to supplement it with withdrawals from your portfolio. Subtract your total annual non-portfolio income from your annual spending target. This is your annual withdrawal target.
Step 3. Set a tax-smart withdrawal strategy
Now that you know how much you need to withdraw, you will need to decide where to withdraw it from. Many investors enter the decumulation phase with multiple accounts that tend to fall into three broad groups from an income tax perspective: taxable, tax-deferred and tax-free. Optimizing withdrawal sequencing from these accounts for tax efficiency usually depends on your tax status. Other factors to consider are your age, whether you expect to pay lower taxes in the future, the types of assets you own and your main objectives (e.g., minimizing current income taxes, funding charitable goals, minimizing income taxes or maximizing benefits for heirs or a combination of objectives).
If you are in the top tax bracket
:
Conventional wisdom holds that your withdrawals should start with required minimum distributions (RMDs) from tax-deferred retirement accounts. You are generally required to take RMDs from company-sponsored retirement plans and IRAs (not Roth IRAs) if you are older than age 72.
Any additional withdrawals should come from taxable accounts. These withdrawals are generally subject to capital gains tax on realized appreciation, with long-term capital gains tax rates ranging from 0% to 20%, depending on income level (3.8% Medicare surtax may also apply for high-income earners). That is considerably lower than the ordinary income tax rates that tax-deferred account withdrawals are generally subject to and offers two major benefits: 1) a lower current tax bill and 2) more time for tax-advantaged growth and compounding for tax-deferred and tax-free assets.
Next comes other tax-deferred accounts, followed by tax-free accounts. Drawing from tax-deferred accounts first allows you to keep tax-free accounts, such as Roth IRAs—which can be great to leave to heirs—for last.
Learn more
if a Roth IRA conversion may make sense.
If you are
not
in the top tax bracket:
Ideal withdrawal sequencing is generally similar, but it may make sense to move up the priority of tax-free accounts, since drawing from tax-deferred assets may place you in a higher tax bracket.Potential exceptions:
There are circumstances when modifications to this general withdrawal sequencing may make sense.We can help
Determining the right sequencing for your unique situation can be complex. Your J.P. Morgan team can help you think through each of these steps more fully to develop a practical, personalized withdrawal strategy designed for your specific needs and goals.
JPMorgan Chase & Co., its affiliates, and employees do not provide tax, legal or accounting advice. This material has been prepared for informational purposes only, and is not intended to provide, and should not be relied on for tax, legal and accounting advice. You should consult your own tax, legal and accounting advisors before engaging in any financial transaction.Through general guidelines, this chart shows that ideal withdrawal sequence depends on tax status. If you are in the top tax bracket: 1) take RMDs, 2) taxable accounts, 3) tax-deferred accounts, then 4) tax-free accounts. If you are not in the top tax bracket: 1) Take RMDs, 2) taxable accounts, 3) tax-free accounts, then 4) tax-deferred accounts.This table shows potential exceptions when modifications to the general withdrawal sequencing (Chart 1) make sense. If you’re still working, you may want to delay RMDs. If you hold low-basis assets in taxable accounts, you may want to consider leaving these assets alone to take advantage of stepped-up basis or use for charitable gifting. If you have an unusually low-income or high-deduction year, you may want to withdraw from tax-deferred accounts earlier. If you have an unusually high-income or low-deduction year, you may want to withdraw from tax-free accounts earlier. If you expect to be subject to lower tax rates later in life, or your heirs are subject to lower tax rates, you may want to withdraw from tax-free accounts earlier.Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.We explore how late-stage tech entrepreneurs can prepare for the future, from planning their business exit to redefining their financial goalsYour path to success may not have been easy but then life’s greatest achievements are rarely straightforward. The later stage of your entrepreneurial journey now brings a new set of challenges for your business and personal life.
Our team of bankers and specialists focus on solutions for high-growth, disruptive companies and their founders at every stage of their life cycle. We have a long history and experience of helping innovative companies and business owners realise their big ideas from day one through to IPO and beyond.
With access to the power of our global franchise – the private bank is your entry to a network of research, services and solutions. J.P. Morgan provides financial solutions to some of the world’s most important companies, government and institutions, from investment management to commercial banking and payments. As well as hosting world-renowned events, we use cutting-edge technologies and innovative tools to bring clients industry-leading analysis.
Take your business to the next stage
Selling your business privately or going public is an avenue to greater liquidity. A multitude of factors are combining to make now an opportune time, including relatively low interest rates, high multiples and record levels of accumulated capital in search of assets. In addition, the pandemic has heightened business owners’ awareness of their exposure to known and unknown risks.
With the right advisers and careful preparation, we’ll give you the confidence to assess the viability of a sale or IPO if and when the opportunity presents. As well as advising on the most appropriate market and exchanges for capital raising we’ll provide guidance on:
Assessing valuations, timings and strategy.
Preparing the prospectus and investor presentations.
Liaising with regulatory authorities on all legal and compliance issues.
Working with other professionals, including brokers, lawyers and reporting accountants.
Organise and structure your private wealth
If the sale or IPO of your company is imminent, you might have the following questions. How much are my stock and options worth? When will I be able to liquidate? What will I do with that windfall? How and when is it best to transfer ownership? What are the overall tax implications?
Here are some of the key issues you’ll want to consider:
Design an estate plan before the liquidity event. Things like where you live or intend to live, or where the acquiring company is registered may trigger fiscal responsibilities. If you want to transfer ownership of some or all of your shares, a transfer before the liquidity event can be more advantageous.
Establish your personal financial plan. For some time you may have put off personal planning to focus on growing your business. Now it is time to review your personal financial goals and ensure that the liquidity event takes you and your family closer to your life goals.
Your company is unique – and so are your needs. Thoughtful, well-tailored planning is essential to optimise your and your family’s financial well-being. At J.P. Morgan, we help entrepreneurs like you optimise your options and sustain the wealth you have worked so hard to earn.
Share ideas and insights with other leaders
Many entrepreneurs say they wished they’d had the chance to hear about the IPO process from those who have come before them. That’s why we’ve designed initiatives like our Technology Founders Forum — an event-powered community, building connections to accelerate the positive impact of technology on our world.
Our invite-only audience brings together entrepreneurs and founders who have raised at least £50 million or had a company valued at over £500 million to share ideas with:
CEOs and chairs of major corporations.
Financial and impact investors representing the world’s most successful funds.
Thought leaders and key influencers in a wide range of fields.
Global leaders such as politicians and heads of state.
Rising star founders of under-the-radar businesses that are developing a product or service with world-changing potential.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.The answer, especially when markets are volatile, may be: “Yes.” But there are some steps you might consider taking right away.Kaylin Klinger, Wealth Strategist
Few people set out to concentrate their wealth in a single company. Yet, over time—whether through career choice, investment selection or inheritance—many find themselves holding significant wealth in a single stock.
If you fall into this camp, you may be wondering if the inherent risks of maintaining the position outweigh the potential rewards—an especially complicated consideration for public company insiders who must comply with company and regulatory policies.
Assessing your position’s exposure to three key risk areas can help you decide if action is needed. The relevant solutions provided below can help bring you closer to your financial and personal goals.
1. The risk of losing money
As with any investment, what goes up can just as quickly go down. The risk to your personal balance sheet can be amplified if a single event or bad quarter significantly impacts the individual company whose stock you own. To regain control:
Determine how much of your portfolio to insulate from single-stock risk (Investors and insiders)
Analyze your full financial picture to determine how much diversification you need to accomplish your long-term financial objectives. You likely will fall into one of two camps:
Protected—You could lose your entire concentrated position tomorrow and still achieve all your goals
Vulnerable—You need to retain a portion of the concentration to reach your goals
Understanding how much of your concentrated position you eventually need to diversify will empower you.
Sell, but avoid moving the market with block trades (Insiders, proceed with caution)
Block sales enable you to sell a large number of shares in a single transaction at a negotiated price. This removes the risk of the stock price dropping as you try to sell, which can happen if you’re divesting a significant volume of shares.
If you are an insider: Be sure you have the blessing of your company’s general counsel and execute the sale in an open-window period.
Limit your exposure with collars (Not for insiders)
If you worry about the downside risk of your single-stock position but have faith in its potential, implementing a
collar-like
strategy may provide protection that’s also cost efficient: This structure limits your downside exposure to a predetermined amount (for example, to a stock price decline of 10%)—and limits your potential gains, offsetting the cost of this protection.
Some investors use a collar to secure a loan—with the position as the collateral—and invest the loan proceeds in a more diversified portfolio. They hold the portfolio until they want to trim their concentrated position.
While many executives are restricted from employing covered calls, collars or similar hedging strategies, they may turn to them after they retire to manage their single stock concentration.2. The risk of taxes
By the time you decide to take some of your concentration off the table, your shares will likely have appreciated substantially, creating a significant tax liability if sold. Here are some ways to maximize the after-tax value of a single-stock position:
Prefund your philanthropic giving with a Donor Advised Fund (DAF) (Investors and insiders)
If you regularly give to charitable organizations: Consider contributing low-basis, long-term appreciated stock to a Donor Advised Fund in a particularly high-income year.
When the shares are sold within the DAF and the proceeds are reallocated to a diversified portfolio the benefit to you is threefold:
You will not incur capital gains tax.
You will be entitled to an immediate charitable deduction that will enable you to align the deduction to the year that most benefits you.
You have the flexibility to decide when to distribute DAF funds to charities of your choice over time.
Note:
All funds in a DAF must be contributed to charity.
Diversify your position and create an income stream with a Charitable Remainder Trust (CRT)
(Investors and insiders)
With a CRT, you transfer shares into an irrevocable trust for the trustee to sell and reinvest the proceeds in a diversified portfolio.
Similar to a DAF, you will not incur capital gains taxes and may deduct the fair market value of the charitable component in the year of contribution.
1
Unlike a DAF, which entirely benefits charity, a CRT generates significant cash flow to you in the form of an annual income stream that is taxable to you upon receipt.
The remaining assets are distributed to charity when the CRT ends, whether at the end of a fixed term (up to 20 years) or upon the death of you or your spouse if created as a lifetime or survivor CRT.
Create a diversified portfolio without an immediate tax bill with an exchange fund
(Not for insiders)
With this strategy, you contribute your single stock to an exchange fund and in return receive units of the fund. These units maintain your original cost basis.
Because each investor in the fund contributes shares of different companies, the units you receive represent a diversified basket of securities. The exchange is not deemed a taxable event, provided you wait seven years to redeem your units. During this period, you hold a diversified portfolio of assets and delay your tax bill.
3. The risk of negative public perception
As any current or former public company executive knows, the restrictions of being a company insider add another layer of risk to managing a single stock position. As an insider, all transactions in company stock are reportable and often scrutinized.
Therefore, it is imperative that you comply with all insider sale restrictions imposed by your company and strive to avoid surprising financial markets.
Here are ways to protect yourself from unwanted scrutiny:
Sell your company shares via a 10(b)5-1 plan (Insiders)
A 10(b)5-1 trading plan can protect you against accusations of trading on material nonpublic information (MNPI) and reassure public markets. This type of plan:
Must be established during an open-window period when you are not in possession of MNPI
Outlines which shares you would like to sell in the future at specified prices
Goes into effect after a
cooling-off period
has taken place
Train the market to expect a sale
(Insiders)
Financial markets like predictability. As a result, many insiders help the market know what to expect by either selling annually as soon as their equity awards vest, or through a 10(b)5-1 plan. Consistency is key and reduces the risk of signaling that there may be issues of concern within the company.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Make “financial fitness” part of their back-to-school program with these simple exercises.Parents and other family elders: There is a unique opportunity this fall, as we re-enter our professional and academic calendars after the summer, while simultaneously planning for the end of year, to engage your teens and young adults.
You can take this “fresh start” to help your young people shape their financial lives, ensuring they are on the right track.
To help, we suggest some actions you might take to help your family members avoid (or at least mitigate) a few, key human tendencies to which people in their teens and early 20s are especially susceptible: “opportunity costs,” “social proof” and “relativity.”
These behavioral science concepts can be defined easily enough. The challenge lies in recognizing these tendencies and not letting them derail us. Such self-awareness can be particularly critical for people who are young, have significant wealth and live among the well-to-do.
Fortunately, our specialists offer some insights and concrete ways you can help your loved ones.
Opportunity costs
While the basics of opportunity costs are easily understood (that when we use money for one thing, we cannot use it for something else), people often fail to fully see and consider tradeoffs. This big picture evaluation can be especially difficult for teens and young adults who may be unclear about their priorities and who lack sufficient knowledge of the world. Moreover, for young people in wealthy families, the question of “financial resources” can get tricky.
We might be able to afford whatever our children might like to spend, but avoiding limits may be unwise if we hope to cultivate adults capable of making sound financial decisions. After all, even great fortunes can be outspent over time, and even billionaires make financial choices.
To teach good decision making around spending and tradeoffs, our specialists suggest these exercises:
Do an accounting
—Show your teens/young adults as much as you can of what it takes to support them. This clear picture of how much their current lifestyles actually cost might be one of the most important lessons you could teach them. It may give them a clearer idea of what career and financial/lifestyle choices and tradeoffs they may later need to make if they wish to maintain their standards of living.
Empower your young people
—Identify the expenses you want them to manage, and set up regular payments into their individual checking accounts sufficient to cover these expenses. In addition to individual discretionary and fixed spending, you might consider asking teens to manage their car insurance, all clothing and personal grooming costs, as well as expenses for extracurricular activities. With college students, you also may want to put them in charge of their basic food budgets, school supplies and individual vacation expenses. Be clear that the amount you’re giving is fixed, but your teens/young adults have autonomy over how to spend it on the various categories that it’s intended to cover.
Hold them responsible
—This action may be hardest and most necessary of all. Odds are your children will make mistakes. For example, they may blow through their month’s allotment in the first couple of weeks and have nothing left to spend on things like a last-minute weekend getaway with friends at the end of the month.  Do your very best to let them experience (some) consequences (without bailing them out, and within reason, and according to your values). One way to remove the potential parental judgment out of conversations about their financial decisions: Suggest that they ask themselves “How am I choosing to spend my money and why?”—and let them know that their answers can be for them only.
Social proof
Most people are influenced by how they believe others like them are behaving. While it can be very helpful to know what others in our circumstances are actually doing, it can be harmful to follow the crowd or latest trend without considering our personal needs and reality.
Obviously, teens and young adults are more likely to follow the herd to their detriment. And such harmful social proof may have grown more potent during the pandemic, when their peers’ social media posturing may have replaced the face-to-face interactions that often provide some reality checks.
Interestingly, our specialists say external influences tend to be strongest on the young when family culture is less clearly defined. This is why they suggest:
Be very clear, and positive, about your family’s values.
State aloud to your children: “In our family, we value (fill in the blank), and this is why we do (fill in the blank).” So what are your family’s priorities? Travel? Entrepreneurship? Wealth building? Security? Community? Education? Philanthropy? Something else?
See if your actions (which communicate your values to your children) support your stated priorities.
One way to check is to look at where you have spent your money and time (both before and during the pandemic). If you find a difference between stated and lived values, or are unclear how to best articulate your family values, you might ask your J.P. Morgan team to share what they see other families in your circumstances are doing—and review whether those choices suit you.
Develop a family motto that reflects your values.
Having a family motto can clarify your messaging and reinforce desired behaviors. You may even ask your children to help wordsmith it. To get you thinking, here are a few family mottos we’ve seen:
In our family, experiences matter more to us than things.
Work hard and be nice to people.
We value faith, family and fun over everything else.
Individual in talents—unified in family spirit.
Relativity
Too often, people judge something based on its “relative value” rather than its “true value” (where true value is how much something actually costs and what it is really worth to us).
One common trap is to justify a purchase simply because it is on sale, making it seem more appealing. Or, say that everyone you know drives the equivalent of a high-end car, or all the handbags where you shop have steep prices, then a mid-priced car or more modest handbag can seem—in comparison—like a more prudent choice. Percentages can also trip us up: People are often more impressed by a 10% return on a $100,000 investment that yields $10,000 than by the 3% return on a $5 million investment that yields $150,000.
To help your children pay attention to true value versus the illusion of “relative value,” we recommend creating an ongoing dialogue with them, and we offer these two ways to jumpstart such conversations:
Discuss everyday purchases
. Food and over-the-counter pharmaceuticals are good areas of focus. For both, the markup for packaging and branding can be dramatic, and easily demonstrated; just take a moment to look and compare ingredients between the high-end and generic options.
Share with your children your decision-making process
when purchasing big-ticket items, highlighting what does and does not hold value for you.
We can help
So that you may be clear with your young people about family resources and your expectations for their behavior, your J.P. Morgan team can help you refine your long-term goals. We also can help you educate your children in financial and investment literacy. Moreover, if you’d like help defining your family motto, please ask your J.P.

Maya Prabhu: Welcome to JP Morgan Private Bank's Spotlight on Family Governance podcast, a part of our Life & Legacy series. I'm your host, Maya Prabhu. Today, I'm privileged to host one of the most enthusiastic and dedicated champions for family businesses, Meghan Juday. Meghan draws on her experience as a fourth generation leader and chairman of the board at Ideal Industries, a family business in operation for over 105 years. Meghan cut her teeth in the family business and further honed her skills as a business analyst and project manager at the computer sciences corporation. As the Ideal family council chair for 14 years, Meghan increased family engagement and mitigated risk. She reimagined roles within the corporation, creating a family development and education program based on family governance and director development. The program gives family members equal access to leadership and director roles with selection based on merit. Meghan has served on the Ideal board since 2008, chairing the nominating and governance committee for five years.
She was named vice chairman in 2018, and became chairman in 2020. She helped develop the Loyola family Business Center's Family Business, Stewardship, and Governance Institute. She serves on the Brightstar Capital Partners' advisory council, and also sits on the editorial board for a number of publications, including Family Business Magazine. She writes for Private Company Director, Family Business Magazine, and many other publications. Most, notably Megan founded the Lotus Forum, an international peer group of female board chairs, vice chairs and lead directors. And she lives in Philadelphia with and two boys. Welcome Meghan. It's wonderful to have you with us today.
Meghan Juday: Maya, thank you so much. This really... I'm looking forward to our conversation.
Maya Prabhu: Perhaps we could start with you telling us a little bit more about your family. And it's really wonderful that you're celebrating a hundred years in operation.
Meghan Juday: So, we have, the Ideal family, we have 50 family members in the third, fourth and fifth generation, 30 shareholders, and we're spread across four time zones, so it can be challenging to get everybody on the phone or in a webinar, or even in person.
Maya Prabhu: And is this is the secret of that to really plan these things well in advance?
Meghan Juday: Yes, exactly. I mean, we publish our annual calendar a year in advance, get things on people's calendars, and we also do a lot of recording, just to make sure that we're taking advantage of all the various opportunities and accommodating people's other personal commitments as well.
Maya Prabhu: This is really interesting. And do you meet in person as well, so it's really using all the formats that are available.
Meghan Juday: Yes. We publish newsletters. We use constant contact to kind of track who's opening things, and not to spy on them, but just to make sure that people are getting the appropriate messaging. And then we'll get on the phone with people as needed. In addition, we do quarterly webinars with our CEO. We do an addition quarterly webinar with our CFO, and then we do various task forces and other governance sessions as needed throughout the year. And then we get to family together twice a year, once at our... We do a national electricians competition, which maybe we can talk more about later, if it's interesting. We bring a bunch of the family down there for that. And then we do our annual shareholders meeting in June, and that's a three day session.
Maya Prabhu: So, it's communication, communication, communication?
Meghan Juday: Yes. And still sometimes, I feel like people have missed stuff, which seems crazy, but that is kind of how it goes.
Maya Prabhu: So, let's roll back a little bit. How and why did you get involved in your family business?
Meghan Juday: I was working as a consultant for about five years at CSC, and I loved that job. That was so fun. I got to work with really big organizations on massive teams, and I got to do things that I thought were really fun, like project management and business analysis, organizational change. And we were working on very large IT installations for big companies, and I was really working on the project management side as well as organizational change side to try to get people enthusiastic and welcoming of whatever IT change that we were implementing. And that was a fun job. I loved it. I could have stayed there a lot longer, but while I was working there, I met my husband, we got married. And I always had wanted to start a family, so we got pregnant. And that's when I realized there were no women working in this firm between the ages of 30 and 45. And I realized it's because that is a job that, whereas you have a lot of employment stability.
You'd never know where you're going from week to week, and can be very long hours, a lot of travel, and it just became untenable to be in that role while also wanting to see my child. So, I left there with the full expectation that I was going to take the first year off to be with my son, and I had my baby, super cute, by the way. And I got a phone call. I had about a three week old at the time, and I got a phone call from my dad who was chairman. He'd been chairman for 30 years. He had been CEO for a large part of that as well. And he said, why don't you just come in and help us on this generational transition? I just don't know what to do. It's really hard. And I really want to work on engaging the fourth generation, of which I'm a member, and get the fourth generation more involved. And I was braced and poised for parented to be really difficult.
But when you have a three week old, you're still in the bubble where they sleep 22 hours a day, and so of course I said yes, not knowing that three week old would turn into a six month old that was not as easy to manage, but it turned out to be a great job. I really feel very passionate about Ideal. I feel passionate about the legacy of our founder, Jay Walter Becker, my great-grandfather, and really working on executing and living the values that he set up the organization with, it's very, very rewarding work. So, I just got in that way. It was really accidental. It wasn't a big plan. In fact, I really thought that I would never work at Ideal, not wanting to live in Sycamore, Illinois, which is a very charming town, but really small and didn't really suit me. So, it was a surprise career, but it has been really wonderful.
Maya Prabhu: Yes. I really sense the deep, emotional connection, apart from how proud you are in the great work the business does, but the real emotional connection with the family and the legacy that makes all the difference makes it even more rewarding to be involved.
Meghan Juday: Absolutely.
Maya Prabhu: Do you think it was useful to work outside the family business as a consultant or in any other role before joining?
Meghan Juday: It was invaluable to me. I think having that outside experience, bringing in new ideas, new concepts... I remember when I first started working for the family, I introduced the groundbreaking concept, in our family, of course we were doing this in the company, but in the family of using conference calls.
It was a big move. So I feel like there was a lot of silly things like that, just kind of process improvements, but then also working in very large complex organizations and understanding the concepts around organizational change. And when you look at what it takes to get an organization... And I'm not really talking about the company, I'm really talking more about the family, which for me, that family really was my client. Although I deal with my employer, the family was my client. That's kind of how I looked at it. And the organizational change in the family system is really foundationally important, and wanting to bring everybody along, even though you may have a core group, family council, for example, who's working on the various topics and process improvements or programs or policies or whatever, do you really need to bring the rest of the family along and make sure that there are plenty of opportunities for people to chime in? So, that, I think was really a very important foundation for me. And I think was able to bring a lot of that knowledge and expertise into the family and family system,
Maya Prabhu:  Which was hugely valuable to the wider family and to the business, of course. Many people hear the term family governance and are sometimes confused and sometimes think it sounds like bureaucracy. What are your thoughts as to what family governance means to you and your family?
Meghan Juday: I really look at family governance as the counterpart to corporate governance. And I know people think of these as very separate items or separate endeavors, but I really believe that family governance and corporate governance have to be in perfect balance to one another. So, for example, and I will get more to the answering your question in a minute, but just as an overview, when you're looking at the importance of corporate governance and helping provide strategic direction, oversight of the CEO, and acting as fiduciaries on behalf of the shareholders, it's really important to have a strong board. And same with a family governance, where really I look at the family governance as helping the family be strategic and being a strategic asset to the organization, as well as maximizing engagement in the family, which can be the key to long term legacy success. And then lastly, to really look at risk mitigation.
So, when you look at the overall risk profile of a family business, usually, the family can be one of the most immediate and biggest risks. If it's not managed properly, probably second to cyber security attack. I mean, any great competitor of yours is going to take more than a couple years to bring down a company, but the family actually could do it fairly quickly, well timed lawsuits or other very distracting activities. I look at the family governance and corporate governance as needing to be equally powerful and equally effective. And for example, if you have a weak corporate governance, the family, actually, if the business Walters, the family will want to get involved in business and governance, corporate governance activities. And same if you have a weaker family or family governance, the board will start identifying the family as a significant risk and will start getting involved in trying to manage and mitigate the family challenges that are coming forward. And you really want both of them to work equally well together.
Maya Prabhu: In their own spaces?
Meghan Juday: Right. Exactly. To be complimentary, to kind of create a cohesive governance umbrella, each focusing on their various areas.
Maya Prabhu: And just to say that, would you say also that it applies equally to say a family office or any shared assets that a family may have, the whole sort of concept of family governance as you've described it? So, whether you have in a family office, the way the family office is run, that'll have its own investment committee and things like that. But alongside that, there's a family part of the family office. And so the family governance is equally relevant there, you saying?
Meghan Juday: Absolutely. And I think oftentimes if you get a family who's been around and working together 3, 4, 5, 6 generations, even if their largest or majority assets are still the family business, you end up finding that you own shared assets. And I think it was kind of a revelation when we realized a couple years ago that even if we... Even though we have very good governance of the ideal asset, we were lacking in good governance around things like shared properties and cabins in the woods and things like that. In fact, a lot of our conflict was coming from assets that weren't under that governance umbrella, the good governance umbrella that we were applying to Ideal. And so in fact, we've been working to extend our good governance across all of the shared assets using similar resources. And obviously, the majority of our time would be spent on the Ideal governance, but the family needs to work together across all of the shared assets, regardless of what they are.
And that good decision making, strong policies, strong agreements, and a good will to work together around collaborating healthy boundaries and effective conflict resolution, all of that needs to be under... Good governance needs to apply to all of those shared assets, not just the one that's the biggest and generating all the money.
Maya Prabhu: Absolutely. One of the terms you mentioned was a family council. I wondered if you could tell us a bit more about what the role of the family council is in your family.
Meghan Juday: So, the family council really is a committed group in our family, is a committed group of family members who spend time focusing on the overall strategic plan for the family. So, we recognize that as the company grows and accelerates, the family really needs to focus on keeping pace. And part of our challenge is that we currently do not have any family members working in the business, and so our role of our family council is to focus, as we mentioned earlier, on all of the various communication avenues we had to keep the family apprised of how much the company's changing or how it's evolving. Our biggest concern really was that we had family members who really weren't spending any time thinking about Ideal, except at the annual shareholders meeting, and they were finding themselves frustrated and lost. If you hear a business update once a year, it really makes it very challenging to keep track of who the new management, if you have new management people, if you have new businesses, if you've made acquisitions.
And so that's really why we started doing a lot more webinars and communications with the family throughout the year, so that we can try to help them keep up with all the various changes going on in the business. But we also really use an occlusive decision making model in our family. So, although we have a family council, when we are working on big projects, policy changes, new programs, whatever is on our agenda for that year, we actually use the task force model. And the task force model is a way that family members can get involved on something they're passionate about without feeling like they need a full commitment to be in the room with the family council on a day to day basis. We allow...
For example, if we're talking about the employment policy, and I know I have three people who are really passionate, either for or against, for example, I want them in the room with the family council to help us, to help us think about all the various angles and considerations that we need to take to make sure that we're really representing the full family perspective in our decision making processes. So, the family council's really... Their core focuses are to really help the family think strategically about being a good partner with the board of management. We really focus on communication, and we focus additionally on running these task forces to make sure that we have family members who are contributing to the overall decision making process. Lastly, I just wanted to mention that when somebody commits to being part of the family council, they are responsible for representing the interests of the entire family and all of their decisions. We don't have branch representation. We don't have people who are just trying to talk about a unique... We want the unique perspectives, but we want them in the context of representing the larger family.
Maya Prabhu: That's a really important concept, actually. And that's where I think the point you made about goodwill, where everyone signs up to that and really thinks about it more broadly is so important to decision making. You have of responsibility, Meghan, chairing the board of your family company, which you took on in the pandemic, really unleash challenge business around the world. And to me, it really highlighted the role of owners. People focus a lot on management. Of course, they are hugely important role, but in really big moments, the role of owners is key to set strategy and to really steward through the storm. As you sort of look back, would you be able to share any reflections on how us chair represented the family owners and sort of took on this big challenge?
Meghan Juday: Yes. Well, by the way, I didn't know I was going to be named chairman two weeks before the pandemic. Had I known that, I may have deferred the appointments. I'll just say, it was a really hard time to be brand new at a job. And by the way, we had a brand new CEO as well. He had been on the job six months before the pandemic hit, and he was very masterful in quickly pivoting the business and keeping employee... The management team and the HR team really worked very carefully to keep the employees safe. We are a manufacturing company that has a global footprint, so with all the various different local laws, really trying to focus on keeping the family, or sorry, keeping our employees safe when they had to come to work every day. One of the things that I would just mention is that we've made a point at Ideal to really live the values of our founder, Jay Walter Becker.
And one of those areas that's critical is taking care of employees, being a good partner with our communities, and working very closely and treating our vendors, customers well. And so I would say, in reflection with our CEO, over kind of looking back over the last couple years, one of the things that he said was so helpful was to have those values as a backdrop for decision making. And so he was able to for... When you look at the bottoms falling out of some of our businesses and other of our businesses were going gangbusters, and he was able to really use those values as a tool for decision making that I think was very helpful for him.
Maya Prabhu: That's amazing. It just goes to show how the values really form the background and the backdrop and the anchor for family decisions, as well as business decisions. And it's what makes family businesses so special, because you don't invent that anchor every year, every day, try and construct it out of nothing, but is so anchored, as you say, in your case, and to the values of the founder. And it really permeates through everything. It's fabulous.
Meghan Juday: I would agree. I think it was a... In retrospect, you kind of talk about them, and oftentimes, values can seem kind of secondary, but in a crisis, they can be one of the helpful things in a decision making process, and I think that's something that we really learned and was kind of... It just refocused our energy and efforts around making sure that we're all clear on what those values are and that we use them as guidelines for decision making.
Maya Prabhu: From everything that you've learned over the years, what would be your advice to anyone who's interested in joining a board position in their family office or in their operating business? How should they prepare themselves?
Meghan Juday: Well, are they... First, it's really important that there's a clear job description around what is expected of a family director, whether it's in the family office or in the family business. Secondly, do everything you possibly can to be prepared, and recognize that if you are able to land one of the board seats, this does not mean that your job is done. Your business or family office are going to have fundamental changes over your tenure as a director, and you have to love learning. It's a lifelong learning essentially. And so I would say be prepared to stay on that learning path, be prepared for the kind of responsibility. It is a big job to be a fiduciary for all the shareholders. Lastly, I would say two tools I would suggest everybody work on.
One is making sure that you are very skilled in having difficult conversations, either in the boardroom or outside, and then lastly is still really focused on developing strong relationships with everybody in the boardroom, including all the family directors. And then with the rest of the family, really making sure you're investing a lot of time into representing and to making sure that you understand everybody in the family landscape so that you can be a good fiduciary for them.
Maya Prabhu: That's wonderful. Thank you. Let's talk about, finally, the Lotus Forum, a body you established for female chairs and directors. How did this come about?
Meghan Juday: Okay, this was an accident. And as I mentioned, or as we just discussed, I was named board chair in February of 2020, which really seemed like a good idea. And by the way, this was a planned transition. Even the date had been planned for years in advance. And by the time... I remember feeling two days of panic once I got the job, of like, ""Oh my gosh, do I really know what I was doing?"" And then kind of steal myself to say, ""Okay, yes, I can do this. I know what I'm doing."" And then of course, the pandemic hits, and I go right back to the beginning of, ""I don't know what I'm doing."" And it was challenging. I inherited a board that people had been on our board for a long time.
They were used to a certain style. They were used to a certain economic climate. They were used to a certain level of wind at Ideal, and everything got turned upside down during the pandemic for a lot of companies, not only just Ideal. I was really struggling and I had joined a peer group for board chairs of family businesses run by Kellogg. And I really enjoyed that. I thought it was great, meeting other people in this role. There're not very many. I mean, they're far more directors than there are board chairs. And I was sending out emails, ""Who's dealing with this? Who's dealing with that? I'm really struggling with this."" And I didn't know... Am I challenged, personally challenged, or are these people just not really relating to what we're going through as a board and a company? And so I thought, ""Well, I'm just go talk to all the female board chairs I know,"" and realized I didn't know any. And that was very eye opening because I had never really, up to that point, recognized that it was unique to be a female board chair.
I never really thought much about gender before that moment of getting into that role,, because I'm just always considered myself a teammate and a contributor, and I love getting stuff done and to work with people. I have a pretty robust network, and I reached out to a couple of people who really work with quite a few families and asked for introductions to any female board chairs they might know, and started working with the people who run Family Business Magazine, MLR media, and just saying, ""Get me introductions. I need to meet some of these women."" And my original thought was that we would put together a quarterly Zoom call for two or three other women, no big deal. We'd schedule in advance. And we could at least learn from one another. That's one of my favorite way of learning, is just listening to other people, learning from them, trading templates, trading stories.
I think it can really help jumpstart people. Especially if you're in a new role, it can really help jumpstart your kind of acceleration. So, as I did that, I actually had one or two. And then all of a sudden, I had 30. And that was at the end of last year. And now we're up to 50. We're in an international group. It's such a big group and it takes so much time that I actually had to hire somebody to come help us. And we are in the process of just... We're continuing to add more people every week. And these women, I have to tell you, it is one of the most fabulous things I have ever done. It is so exciting to be in a room of so many talented women. I mean, talented people anyway, but I feel like there's a special kindred spirit experience spending time with female board chairs, because they're so grateful to be in the room.
A lot of these women have never, like me, had never met another female board chair or vice chair or lead director, and so there was some great opportunities for us to really focus on... I mean, the core focus of our group is excellence. It doesn't matter if you're a man or woman, you have got to be great at your job. And being chairman is far more complicated than putting together a quarterly agenda. There are a lot of moving parts, there's a lot of nuance, there's a lot of work that needs to be done between the meetings, to have a good meeting, and it's a much more significant body of work than one would think, or it seems like from the outside. We bring in subject matter experts. We bring authors of books. We'll bring experts in their fields to come in and talk on an annual agenda that the group sets themselves.
And there's really kind of two categories. One is to focus on governance, excellence, things like board composition or CEO, evaluations, board strategy, building a strategic board, those kinds of things. And then there's another one, which is really what are those top of mind items that are coming up on the board agenda that the board chairs really need to have a better understanding of a need to know how to have a significant and meaningful oversight in the board room? Like, EFG, DE&I, cyber security, enterprise risk management, there's that kind of big body of work that's going on that's kind of coming up, and it's challenging to know how to run those programs. If you don't know enough about them and know if they're being done properly or not.
It's been remarkable experience. We get the group together two times a quarter virtually, and we are in the process of finalizing our first in person meeting where we'll get a chance to meet one another. I have to say, it's been very rewarding, super fun, and very energizing. It was one of the best things... It was one of the bright spots. Everyone had a few bright spots during the pandemic, but this is certainly one of my bright spots. It's been very enjoyable to get to know all these women.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.We all are vulnerable to fraud and identity theft, regardless of age, education or level of wealth. With data breaches on the rise, individuals and businesses are increasingly concerned about the consequences of having their information in the hands of cybercriminals.
The topic of fraud and identity theft can be daunting, and after any data breach, there are several questions that tend to be top of mind:
Has my information been compromised?
If you operate under the assumption that your information is already available to fraudsters, you may make smarter cyber decisions. Data breaches vary in their level of severity and type of information compromised, from name and email address to government IDs and account numbers. A hacker can build a profile about you with the data breach information, as well as additional material bought and sold on the dark web and data found on social media. Therefore, it is important to take precautions to mitigate for any potential identity theft.
What other ways can hackers get my information?
Your data can be compromised in a variety of ways, even if you are not the victim of a data breach. They also employ social engineering techniques, such as phishing, through email, social media, texts or phone calls to gain confidential information. Fraudsters might trick you to enable them to remotely access your device, allowing them to download malware or provide confidential information.
How can I prevent becoming a victim of fraud and identity theft?
While there is no guarantee that you will not fall victim to fraud and identity theft, there are steps you can take to lower your risk:
In the United States, consider securing or freezing your credit if you have not done so already.
Do not use personally identifying information as your username or password.
Create strong and complex passwords on all devices and online accounts, and never share them. Change them frequently and consider using a password management tool.
Adopt multi-factor authentication wherever offered, especially on financial, email, social media and shopping accounts.
Be mindful of the information you share with others, even in the normal course of doing business, and never share banking credentials and passwords.
Be wary of social engineering techniques. Be cautious when opening emails with spoofed email addresses, poor grammar or spelling, and suspicious attachments or links in emails. Do not assume a phone call is genuine because they have your information, and do not call or text an unknown phone number.
Do not allow anyone to access your computer remotely, even if they claim to be from a reputable company. A common scheme used by fraudsters comes in the form of a pop-up on your screen or a phone call stating you have a virus on your device. Since this type of contact is most likely fraud, do not engage with the perpetrator; close out of the window or hang up on the caller.
Always validate payment instructions by calling the originator on a known number when instructions are received via email, even if the email is from a trusted individual.
Consider using online bill pay to avoid exposing your personal and account information if a check is lost or stolen in the mail.
Keep financial documents and records in a secure place, and destroy sensitive documents you no longer need.
Seniors, children and vulnerable individuals can also be at risk if their information is compromised. Fraud can be perpetrated against them and often goes unnoticed for a longer period of time, so ensure that the same steps are taken to protect them.
Picking up the pieces
Identity theft can be an overwhelming event and can take months or even years to rectify, without even taking into account financial ramifications. Refer to

https://privatebank.jpmorgan.com/gl/en/insights/planning/decisions-of-eye-watering-difficulty,"TaxesAutumn Statement 2022 - “Decisions of eye-watering difficulty”published Date:- Nov 18, 2022Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.
Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Yesterday the Chancellor Jeremy Hunt announced the Autumn Statement 2022 and the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) released its much anticipated updated assessment of the UK economy. This announcement is the culmination of nearly 2 months of uncertainty and change in the upper echelons of UK politics. The mini-budget announced on 23rd September 2022 has been acknowledged to have contained ‘mistakes’ and since then many of the faces behind the despatch box have changed. The UK has a new Prime Minister (the third this year) and Chancellor (the fourth). The current so called fiscal ‘black hole’ in the UK’s public finances has been estimated at around £55 billion. Based on the measures announced yesterday, the government is seeking to balance the books via a mixture of spending cuts and raising taxes.
This Autumn Statement provides some clarity around how the Conservative Government is to achieve its aim of “facing into the storm”
and in restoring the UK’s economic credibility on the global stage.
Personal Taxes
Stating that ‘those in the highest income households will contribute more’, the headline change is the lowering of the threshold for the additional rate of tax from £150,000 to £125,140. In practice this brings the top 2% of earners in the UK into the 45% additional rate and will cost those earning over £125,140 per annum an additional £1,200.
1
The Government estimates the lowering of the additional rate threshold will raise £80m in 2022-23, £420m in 2023-24, rising to £790m in 2024-25.
2
This stands in stark contrast to the abolition of the rate which was announced less than 8 weeks ago as part of the mini-budget by the then Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng, which was swiftly unwound by Jeremy Hunt when he assumed the role on the 17
th
October 2022.
To avoid increases to the headline rates of tax (which would break the Conservative Party’s 2019 manifesto commitment), the Chancellor has favoured an extension to the freezing of tax rates and thresholds instead, which will now be extended from 2026 until 6
th
April 2028. This includes the Personal Allowance, higher rate threshold, main National Insurance thresholds and the Inheritance Tax (IHT) thresholds. As a result, as wages increase a larger proportion of earners in the UK will pay tax and / or pay tax at higher rates.
Finally, the dividend allowance has been reduced from £2,000 to £1,000 from 6th April 2023 and £500 from 6th April 2024. The dividend ordinary, upper, and additional rates of income tax will remain at 8.75%, 33.75%, and 39.35% respectively for 2023/24, although the threshold at which the 39.35% rate will apply will also reduce in line with the additional rate band for other income.
CGT
Rumours that the historically low rate of CGT of 20% would be increased proved unfounded. However, the current Annual Exemption from CGT has been reduced from £12,300 to £6,000 from 6
th
April 2023 and to £3,000 from 6
th
April 2024.  This in line with the Office of Tax Simplification’s recommendation in its 2020 report “
CGT: Simplifying by design
” where they called for the Annual Exemption to be reduced to between ‘£2,000 to £4,000’.
3
The Government estimates this will raise an additional £25m in 2023-24 rising to £275m in 2024-25 and £425m in 2025-26.
4
Property taxes
In the mini budget on 23 September 2022, the Government increased the nil-rate threshold of Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) from £125,000 to £250,000 for all purchasers of residential property in England and Northern Ireland and increased the nil-rate threshold paid by first-time buyers from £300,000 to £425,000. The maximum purchase price for which First Time Buyers’ Relief can be claimed was also increased from £500,000 to £625,000. The Government has confirmed these reductions will now come to an end on 31 March 2025.
‘Non-Dom’ regime
Despite speculation that a consultation or immediate changes to the Resident Non-Domiciled (RND) regime may be announced, the regime was not mentioned in the Chancellor’s Autumn Statement. This speculation was driven mainly by increasing pressure from the Labour party and the fallout earlier in the year from the revelation that the then Chancellor, now Prime Minister’s wife had benefitted from the regime.  Separately, the Prime Minister has committed to publishing his tax return by Christmas.
5
One technical policy change is being made which does impact RND individuals which was released alongside the Autumn Statement.
6
Individuals who hold more than 5% of shares and securities in a UK close company, and exchange some or all of those securities for an equivalent holding of securities in a non-UK company, will now pay tax on gains, dividends and distribution income received in respect of those securities in the same way as if the securities were a UK company, with no access to the remittance basis on that income or gains.
7
This measure has effect for share exchanges, schemes or reconstruction carried out on or after 17
th
November 2022.
On the
Today Programme, Radio 4
this morning Jeremy Hunt was questioned about measures included in the budget and in particular the notable lack of any mention of the non-dom regime. In response he defended the choice stating that he has ‘tried to avoid doing anything that damages long-term growth’. He was pressed as to whether the Treasury had provided him with a number of what changes to or abolition of the regime would raise in tax revenue which they were unable to do. In addition he maintains that he and the Treasury do not want to damage the ‘UK’s attractiveness’. Finally, his closing remark on the matter was: ‘by the way it was a Conservative idea to introduce this charge for non-doms which is raising millions and millions of pounds and we’ve also increased it significantly, now they pay up to £75,000 [sic – the Remittance Basis charge is £30,000 or £60,000 per annum], so I think it is right they do pay something but I’m not going to do something that is going to damage the long-term attractiveness of the UK, even though it gives easy shots to opposition parties’. So, for now, the status quo for the non-dom regime continues.
Energy Profits Levy
While ostensibly not in favour of extended so-called ‘windfall’ taxes, Jeremy Hunt concedes that businesses making extraordinary profits due to external factors should contribute more. Therefore, in the oil and gas sector the Energy Profits Levy has been extended to the end of March 2028 and the rate increased from 25% to 35% from 1
st
January 2023. In addition, the government is introducing a new temporary 45% Electricity Generator Levy. Combined these measures are estimated to raise an additional £14 billion over the next year.
Summary of policies announced today*:
An extension of the freezing of the basic and higher rate of income tax thresholds and allowances for an additional 2 years until 2028, the freeze was originally planned to end in 2026;
A lowering of the threshold for the additional rate of tax from £150,000 to £125,140, effectively increasing the number of taxpayers who will be paying tax at the additional rate (45%);

* While some of these measures will impact the whole of the UK, others will only apply to England as the governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland make some tax and spending decisions independently. The Scottish Parliament and the Senedd will set rates of income tax on non-savings and non-dividend income payable by Scottish and Welsh taxpayers respectively. The Scottish Parliament will also set the tax bands for Scottish taxpayers’ non-savings and non-dividend income.
Measures presumed retained from the mini-budget (still to be confirmed and legislated for):
EIS and VCT extension beyond the 2025 expiry date;
Removal of the cap on senior bankers bonuses of 100% of their fixed pay or 200% with shareholder approval; and
The creation of 38 new low-tax, low-regulation investment zones.
Call it what it is: austerity
The UK faces a challenging path ahead. Chancellor Hunt described the economy as already in recession, a point also echoed in the Bank of England’s own forecasts that see the UK on the brink of its longest recession on record. The OBR’s estimates expect real GDP growth to sink -1.4% next year and the unemployment to increase to 4.9% by 2024 (from 3.6% today). Combined with word this week that inflation notched a new 41-year high (in large part due to soaring energy prices), it’s clear that Britons are in the midst of an acute cost of living crisis. Indeed, the Office for Budget Responsibility now estimates that disposable incomes will decline by 7% over the next two years, the largest drop on record and effectively wiping out the past 8 years of growth.In announcing its £55 billion in fiscal consolidation to plug the large gap in the UK’s public finances, the government seeks to alleviate the country’s growing debt problem, lower inflation and borrowing costs, and limit the downside to economic growth. Tighter fiscal conditions will indeed add pressure to growth, but the benefit it could bring in squashing the cost of living crisis presents a necessary trade-off. To achieve these ends, Chancellor Hunt announced two new fiscal rules to achieve by 2027: for public sector net debt (as a % of GDP) to be falling and for public sector net borrowing to be below 3%. This will be an ambitious task, and the balance between public spending and growth will be key to watch.That said, over the longer-term, Hunt made it clear that the government continues to support spending in energy (particularly in the renewable space), infrastructure (such as the HS2 rail upgrade), and other innovation-oriented initiatives—all of which, in theory, should support growth further in the future.
On the news, UK government bond yields are falling—with 30-year Gilts now back at pre-“mini-budget” levels, erasing all of the risk premia that plagued investors over the last two months. Sterling is slightly weaker versus the U.S. dollar, but the moves largely seem to be driven by sentiment around the Federal Reserve’s hawkish rate hike path. That said, it is still difficult to see a clear path higher for sterling in the short-term given the weakening economic outlook.
Meanwhile, the UK equity market has outperformed globally this year thanks to a weaker pound that has benefitted exporters and the index’s higher weighting towards energy and interest-rate sensitive sectors. However, given that the UK economy still faces significant risks, we prefer to allocate to other areas in Europe (like France) over the UK, and the U.S. over Europe in general.
Conclusion – it’s a real (fiscal) drag
Having promised ‘decisions of eye-watering difficulty’ and fervent speculation in the media, yesterday’s statement contained fewer changes to personal tax than many had expected.  Technically (but only technically) the Conservatives remain able to claim to have not raised the rate of income tax, VAT or National Insurance, a 2019 manifesto commitment.  The reality is the amount individuals will pay in income tax, VAT and National Insurance has increased under this government as they have frozen tax thresholds during a period of increasing wages and high inflation (otherwise known as ‘fiscal drag’).  After sustained political pressure the government chose to ignore the non-dom regime and CGT saw no increase to the headline rates.
That being said, one promise has been kept:  everyone will pay more tax.

The line chart shows two series, based on the Office for Budget Responsibility’s forecasts in March 2022 (dark blue line) and November 2023 (light blue line). The main takeaway is that, while the UK has faced higher inflation and higher rates, the outlook for growth is more depressed in the November 2022 forecasts than the March 2022 forecasts. In detail, the March 2022 forecast series starts at 97.4 in Q1 2018, rising to a local peak of 100.0 in Q3 2019, before falling to a trough of 78.4 in Q2 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. It then recovered to 99.6 by Q4 2021 and was forecasted to reach 109.3 by Q1 2027. The November 2022 forecast series starts at 97.4 in Q1 2018, rising to a local peak of 100.0 in Q3 2019, before falling to a trough of 76.9 in Q2 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. It then recovered to 98.9 by Q4 2021 and was forecasted to reach 108.1 by Q1 2028. 

The second chart shows the OBR’s forecasts for the year-over-year change in UK real GDP for both March and November 2022. The main takeaway is that, while the UK has faced higher inflation and higher rates, the outlook for growth is more depressed in the November 2022 forecasts than the March 2022 forecasts. The forecasts are as follows: March 2022 UK real GDP forecasts: 2022: 3.8%, 2023: 1.8%, 2024: 2.1%, 2025: 1.8%, and 2026: 1.7%. November 2022 UK real forecasts: 2022: 4.2%, 2023: -1.4%, 2024: 1.3%, 2025: 2.6%, and 2026: 2.7%.The line chart shows the path of the UK’s public sector net borrowing as a % of GDP, starting in 2007-08, as well as the OBR’s forecasts in March 2022 and November 2022 through 2027-2028. Historically, the UK’s public sector net borrowing as a % of GDP (grey line, labelled “outturn”) stood at 3.0% in 2007-08, reaching a high of 10.2% in 2009-10, falling to a trough of 2.0% in 2018-19, rising to a peak of 15.0% in 2020-21 in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, and falling again to 5.7% in 2021-22. The OBR’s March 2022 forecasts expected the UK’s public sector net borrowing as a % of GDP to fall to 2.7% in 2021-22 and steadily decline to 2.1% in 2024-2025. By contrast, the November 2022 forecasts expect the UK’s public sector net borrowing as a % of GDP to first rise to 7.1% in 2022-23, and then decline in a choppy fashion to 2.4% in 2027-28. The main takeaway is that weaker growth has resulted in lower tax revenues, and as a result, pushed up overall borrowing levels, relative to the March 2022 forecasts.Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.The pandemic has led to a dramatic increase in ransomware attacks globally. And getting targeted now can be expensive and disruptive, especially at a time when additional disturbances may be particularly hard to absorb.
Estimates put the cost of ransomware to the U.S. economy alone at $1.3 trillion in 2020.
1
By some measures, that U.S. total in 2021 could run to $6 trillion, including downtime, with the possibility of an attack happening every 11 seconds on average.
2
But there is much you can do right now to protect your firm and help safeguard personal information and wealth.
The rise of ransomware attacks
Beginning last year, as the coronavirus raged, many people began working from home in cyber environments often less secure than their offices could provide. Since then, many businesses have been forced to become more digital in how they interact with customers.
Just in 2021 year-to-date, ransomware attacks have risen as much as 485% over 2020.
3
At J.P. Morgan, we have seen a marked uptick in clients victimized by ransomware attacks. Often, it’s because their firms lacked the right safeguards to stop ransomware invasions. And even as employees have begun returning to offices, cybercriminals continue to target businesses with ransomware.
Businesses across the globe of all types and sizes have fallen victims to ransomware attacks. But the most frequently targeted are currently companies in the oil & gas infrastructure, healthcare and education industries. Also, as many regions do not require reporting of cyber attacks, and businesses everywhere are reluctant to reveal ransomware attacks, reported numbers are likely a small portion of actual cases.
The real costs of a cyber ransom
Many organizations prefer to keep ransomware attacks private because being a target can lead to loss of reputation, require expensive public relations efforts and strain relations with valued stakeholders.
The additional toll on the business leaders and the organizations’ clients should not be underestimated.
As for potential financial losses, McAfee predicts that attackers will increasingly target home-workers in order to compromise their employers, while monetary demands often run into the millions and are rising.
4
Beyond any ransom paid, the cost of cleaning up and remediating a ransomware more than doubled from an average of over $761,000 in 2020 to $1.85 million in 2021.
5
This figure includes downtime, technical remediation and reputational damage.
Moreover, ransomware insurance, even if you keep it up-to-date and are in full compliance with its terms, is unlikely to cover all costs.
How to protect yourself against ransomware
Prevention is your best defense. Here are the critical steps in any good plan:
1) Know the enemy
Ransomware is a form of malware that typically works to deny a company’s access to its own critical systems or data files until a ransom is paid. In recent twists on this basic playbook, cybercriminals have threatened to release sensitive information unless a ransom is paid.
Infiltration comes through a number of avenues; one of the top ways is through phishing emails that, seemingly from legitimate vendors or contacts, entice users to click on a link or attachment.
Once in a system, ransomware can lie undetected in an organization’s systems for days, even months, collecting information before a successful attack is launched and ransom demanded. Personal as well as business information can be compromised.
Criminals typically demand to be paid in cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin, as they seek to stay anonymous.
2) Stay ready
Ensure that you’re staying up-to-date on the latest software releases, which include essential security patches and address known vulnerabilities.
Back up data regularly.
Establish a business incident response team to include business representatives, Technology, Operations, Communications and Legal prior to any incident to address business and regulatory issues.
Prioritize critical business functions in a disaster recovery plan, should an incident still occur.
Maintain data and operations contingency plans so your company can operate if attacked. This may include partnering with outside specialists who can help you navigate a ransomware incident.
3) Rally troops
We cannot overemphasize the importance of everyone in your organization remaining vigilant. Help them by:
Instituting ongoing cyber educational programs that include a variety of cyber awareness exercises (e.g., phishing simulations, regular training).
Informing and reminding them where they can report suspicious activities and emails.
4) Test your readiness
Conduct regular cyber assessments and routine monitoring to understand your vulnerabilities or cyber risks.
5) Strike

Ransomware is in the headlines daily. If a company with which you do business is compromised, don’t wait; take immediate action.
Protect yourself, separate from whatever that company does. Before you are also a victim of a cyberattack, change your password at all the sites at which you have used that same password, and contact every financial institution with which you do business to tell them your information or credentials may have been compromised.
If you live in the United States, we also suggest freezing your credit with all the major credit agencies so that fraudsters cannot open new accounts in your name. Consider placing alerts on existing accounts to watch for unauthorized activity. Compromised credentials can cost you a lot.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Some areas to focus on in the Autumn Statement 2022
On Thursday, the new Chancellor Jeremy Hunt will announce his Autumn Statement, and the Office for Budget Responsibility (“OBR”) will release its much anticipated updated assessment of the UK economy.
The Autumn Statement comes hot on the heels of the then Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng’s mini-budget, which has been acknowledged by Mr Hunt and the Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, as having contained ‘mistakes’.
There is much in the press around the fiscal ‘black hole’ that the Chancellor will attempt to fill, with the BBC reporting that it had ‘been told it may be at least £50bn’.
1
The Times has reported that the Government has ‘drawn up plans for £33bn of spending cuts and £22bn in tax rises’.
2
Mr Hunt has spent some time since he assumed his new post ‘rolling the pitch’, making it clear that this Statement will require “eye-wateringly difficult decisions” and stating on
Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg
on
13 November: “I think I’ve been completely explicit that taxes are going to go up, and that’s a very difficult thing for me to do because I came into politics to do the exact opposite.”
Speculation has been rife about what could change on Thursday; no tax has been left out of the range of possibilities being reported as due for reform, increase or both.
In an attempt to cut through the noise, we have highlighted three main areas that we think should be paid particular attention.
The focus on these three areas isn’t to say that the reported freezing of tax thresholds for income tax, national insurance, VAT and pensions savings and the lowering of the threshold at which taxpayers pay 45% on their income from £150,000 to £125,000 are immaterial.
1. Capital Gains Tax (CGT)
Generally, CGT is charged on the profit you make when you dispose of an asset. The current rates of CGT on most types of assets are 10% for basic rate taxpayers and 20% for higher rate taxpayers. A higher rate of 28% is charged on gains realised as a result of the disposal of a second home or on carry payments received.
In July 2020, in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, then Chancellor Rishi Sunak requested that the (now disbanded) Office of Tax Simplification (the “OTS”) “undertake a review of Capital Gains Tax and the aspects of the taxation of chargeable gains in relation to individuals and smaller businesses”. The OTS report “
CGT Review: Simplifying by design
” (the “OTS CGT Report”) was published in November 2020 and made a number of recommendations that were not acted on, but are worth highlighting as we approach the Autumn Statement.
One of the key recommendations of the OTS CGT Report was ‘more closely aligning CGT rates with Income Tax rates’ and ‘the reduction of the number of CGT rates and the extent to which liabilities depend on the level of a taxpayer’s income’.
It is also worth noting that the current higher rate of CGT of 20% is historically low and that it is possible for changes to the rate of CGT to happen mid-fiscal year. For example, in 2010 an increase to CGT was announced in Parliament at lunchtime and came into force from midnight on the same day.
2. The ‘non-dom’ regime
Reform of the ‘non-dom’ regime is back on the agenda.
In April, the Labour Party announced that for the expected 2024 election, a manifesto commitment will be to abolish the non-dom regime.
3
Labour claims this will raise £3.2bn, a number sourced from a CAGE policy briefing (a research centre based in the Department of Economics at the University of Warwick).
4
When questioned on the topic at Prime Minister’s Questions on 26 October by Labour leader Kier Starmer, the Prime Minister’s response was coy – he neither defended the regime nor indicated he agrees it needs reform.
5
There have already been substantial changes to the regime in 2008 (under a Labour government, where the instances in which a taxable remittance to the UK could occur were increased), and then again in 2017 (under the Coalition Government, when it became impossible to claim the remittance basis of taxation after 15 years of tax residence in the UK).
It has been argued that the Prime Minster faces additional political pressure to be seen to be doing something, given his spouse had previously claimed non-dom status.
3. Inheritance Tax (IHT)
In the UK the threshold above which an individual starts to pay IHT (broadly speaking, 40% of your net estate) is currently £325,000. This threshold was first set in 2009. The press is reporting that this threshold will be frozen until at least April 2026.
6
This will draw a larger proportion of UK estates into the IHT net.
Conclusion
Students of government fiscal statements will note that they are frequently staid affairs, with plenty of speculation in advance often exposed as having been unfounded. That being said, it is widely acknowledged that following the mini-budget, the Autumn Statement is going to need to contain some significant changes to taxation to help restore the UK’s economic credibility.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.In our third note regarding the so called “mini-budget” in just over three weeks, we cover the changes to the Cabinet, as well as the further changes to the Fiscal Plan made since the 45p tax rate was re-established.
After weeks of turmoil, Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng was replaced by Jeremy Hunt, making Mr. Kwarteng’s tenure as Chancellor the second shortest in modern UK politics. Jeremy Hunt is an experienced hand in the Cabinet, having previously held the positions of Health Secretary, Culture Secretary and Foreign Secretary. He was a supporter of Rishi Sunak during the recent leadership election, and his appointment could be viewed as an attempt to show that Prime Minister Liz Truss is willing to listen to opinions from both wings of the Conservative Party and lend a steady hand to her premiership.
In addition to replacing her Chancellor on Friday, Prime Minister Truss also repealed the proposed changes to Corporation Tax, maintaining the planned rise to 25% from the current rate of 19% in April 2023, which will impact large companies and certain companies dealing mainly in investments. This is estimated to raise nearly £18bn a year in tax under current plans.
Further, the new Chancellor Hunt released a statement reversing the majority of measures from the “mini-budget” announced three weeks ago. These measures have been pulled directly from the government’s “Medium-Term” Fiscal Plan, which is due to be announced on 31st October 2022. Rather than wait until then to announce the measures, the government seems to be working to pre-announce the changes in an attempt to reduce “unhelpful speculation”. That said, the only measures retained from the original mini-budget are:
The abolition of the Health and Social Care Levy and the reversal of the National Insurance increase;
The reduction to Stamp Duty Land Tax, which came in on 23
rd
September. This raised the threshold at which stamp duty land tax starts to be paid to £250,000 from £125,000, (£425,000 for first time buyers from £300,000);
The £1Million Annual Investment Allowance, the Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme and the Company Share Options Plan will continue to support business investment; and
The removal of the cap on bankers’ bonuses.
Crucially, the biggest announcement was the scaling back of the Government support for energy bills. With the current level of support now being maintained only until April 2023 (as opposed to 2 years). Mr Hunt has ordered a Treasury-led review which will determine the new approach going forward.
Among those measures that have been fully scrapped from the mini budget proposal are:
Cuts to dividend tax rates by 1.25% from April 2023 (maintaining the top rate at 39.35%);
Repeal of the 2017 and 2021 reforms to the off-payroll working rules (known as IR35, which apply where a worker provides their services via their own limited company);
Reduction in the basic rate of tax from 20% to 19% from April 2023; and
Introduction of a new VAT-free shopping scheme for non-UK visitors.
Altogether, the direct impact of these measures will be to raise roughly £32bn in tax, which goes some way towards closing the £72bn gap reportedly forecast by the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR).
The Chancellor issued a statement to the House of Commons outlining the ways in which the proposed budget cuts will be funded in an attempt to reduce the remaining hole in the UK’s finances.
Thoughts on the economic and market impact
In the wake of the government’s not-so-mini mini budget in September, volatility in UK financial markets exploded. Some of the most astounding moves have come from 30-year Gilts, where yields have surged by 150bps in the last month—an 8 standard deviation move, which is incredibly rare. The shock to markets has exposed significant financial stability risks, particularly within the UK Pension Liability Driven Investment (LDI) system.
These large swings in UK assets are emblematic of the risks that arise when policymakers move this fast.
That said, while the UK government’s U-turn alleviates some pressure and near-term uncertainty, the economy still faces a difficult combination of high inflation, deteriorating growth, and financial instability. This was also true before the announcement of the mini-budget. The Bank of England’s own forecasts call for stagnating growth throughout 2024. And as the shock higher interest rates reverberates through the economy, lending and interest rate sensitive activity are sure to face challenges. In all, risks remain high for the UK economy, while global spillovers from these domestic challenges look limited in our view.

Further to our note on the Chancellor’s “mini-budget” announced on Friday 23rd September, we can share the following update.
After a tumultuous 10 days in which members of all political parties united to show their dissatisfaction with the “mini-budget”, the Prime Minister and the Chancellor have made a U-turn and cancelled the proposed abolition of the 45% additional rate of income tax rate.
Citing the reasoning for the U-turn, the Chancellor stated that the abolition of the 45p tax rate had become a  “terrible distraction” from the wider growth plan.
The overall plan, including other measures such as the removal of the National Insurance increase, would have handed back approximately £10,000 to the richest households in the country, with the poorest saving on average £22

.
Income tax is the highest tax revenue generator for the UK treasury, bringing in around £192 billion for 2020/21
2
.
Cutting the top-rate of income tax was estimated to only cost the treasury £2 billion in receipts, not a significant amount when compared to the £45 billion total tax cuts in the “mini-budget”
3
.
The Chancellor has brought forward the timing of his “medium-term fiscal plan”, which will be accompanied by an OBR forecast, to later this month (October) - a month earlier than originally anticipated. It is also of note that the remaining measures from the “mini-budget” still need to be voted in before they can come into effect, so it is not currently clear what the tax landscape will look like on 6
th
April 2023. What is clear is that the Prime Minister and her Chancellor need to solidify the policies of the Conservative Party and present a strong message to the British public if they hope to generate the growth required to fund the proposed tax cuts and increased borrowing.
Economic Update
Elevated volatility in rates and FX markets of late has largely been driven by developments in the UK, and this continued last week. After markets told us that a higher return is required for foreign investors to help finance the UK’s fiscal easing measures announced at the “mini-budget” two weeks ago, the Bank of England was forced to intervene last week. To restore orderly market conditions, they announced two weeks of unlimited asset purchases and postponed its planned commencement of quantitative tightening to the end of October. The 30-year UK Gilt yield dropped a staggering 107bps on the day, and sterling was able to bounce from its lows. And with the UK’s fiscal discipline also under increased scrutiny, the Chancellor announced this week that his government will not go ahead with the plan to scrap a 45% rate of income tax on top earners.
Still, the recent price action is concerning. The decoupling in Gilt yields and sterling is similar to what was seen in Turkish assets in 2018. Investors are pricing in a lot of UK-specific risk premia, with GBPUSD now trading at its largest discount to “fair value” since Brexit. Risks still seem skewed to the downside for sterling, and we now see cable ending the year at 1.05 (1.03-1.07) by year-end.

The new Conservative Cabinet must take action to provide reassurance to households at a point where energy bills are at an all-time high and inflationary pressures and the arrival of a recession weigh on people’s minds.
Prime Minister Liz Truss made a commitment to “no new taxes” during the Conservative Party leadership campaign, meaning there will be no new government receipts to fund the promised support, leading to increased borrowing by the government. The government’s current plan seeks to utilise tax cuts, the simplification of the tax system and the reduction of benefits for certain job-seekers, as well as the introduction of measures on the supply side in order to promote growth.
There was nothing ‘mini’ about the plan announced by the Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng who outlined what is being described as the most significant reform to tax policy in the UK in a generation. The government’s objective with this series of measures is to boost growth and “unleash the power of the private sector”. These measures included a raft of tax cuts, crucially with no associated OBR forecast, which has been promised by the end of the year.
The key announcements from the Growth Plan 2022
*
are:
A cancellation of the proposed Corporation Tax rate increase from 19% to 25%, which was due to come in on 1st April 2023.
A cancellation of the recent 1.25% increase to Employer’s National Insurance, which will be effective from 6th November 2022.
The planned Health and Social care levy on employees due from April 2023 has been cancelled.
The additional rate of income tax of 45% on income above £150,000 will be abolished, effective from 6th April 2023.
The additional 1.25% increase to dividend tax introduced alongside the Health and Social Care measure which came into force on 6th April 2022 will be reversed from 6th April 2023.
The basic rate of income tax will be cut to 19% from 20% effective from 6th April 2023.
The threshold at which stamp duty land tax starts to be paid has been increased to £250,000 from £125,000, effective from midnight on 23rd September (£425,000 for first time buyers from £300,000).
The maximum value for first time buyer relief on property will increase to £625,000 from £500,000.
The cap on bankers’ bonuses will also be abolished, and the government plans an ‘ambitious deregulatory package’ to support the UK financial services sector.
The off-payroll working rules, known as IR35, will be repealed from 6th April 2023.
Seed Enterprise Investment schemes (SEIS) and Company Share Option Plan (CSOP) limits to be increased, Enterprise Investment Schemes (EIS) and Venture Capital Trusts VCT reliefs to be extended beyond 2025.
Introduction of sales tax-free shopping for overseas visitors.
The Chancellor also announced support for businesses, maintaining the Annual Investment Allowance at £1 million rather than the planned drop to £200,000. He is also in discussions to create 38 ‘investment zones’ which will offer time limited tax cuts for businesses and developments in specific regions.
These plans are part of the Chancellor's “new approach for a new era”, and it remains to be seen what additional measures could be announced in the Autumn Budget. This is currently predicted to be in November 2022.Many of the changes telegraphed today were also announced earlier by newly minted Prime Minister Liz Truss. Central to the government’s plans are support provisions for households and businesses to weather the storm of higher energy costs. The measures included a freeze on household energy bills, as well as support targeted at reducing energy-related costs by more than half for businesses and public organisations. The government said the cost of these measures would amount to a sizeable £60bn over six months. However, that figure is based on “recent prices”, and given the price of energy has fallen considerably from all-time highs in late August, the price-tag could rise further if energy costs increase again.Beyond the measures in place to counter the energy crisis, the government announced several tax cuts as part of their “Plan for Growth” to return to a lofty growth target of 2.5%. This marks the most radical package of tax cuts for the UK since the 1970’s, reducing levies both on worker pay and companies in an effort to boost the long term potential of the economy.
That said, these plans did not come alongside a concrete assessment of their impact, namely with an update on public finances from the independent Office of Budget Responsibility (which is expected in late Autumn). Despite a cap on near-term costs for households and businesses and the government’s hopes for stronger growth, such stimulus is likely to carry a price tag that complicates the inflation picture further down the line. This could ultimately require the BoE to tighten policy even more aggressively to tame inflation (particularly given that UK inflation expectations are on the rise), and bond markets are pricing this in. With that said, data released earlier this week showed that the UK government borrowed £11.8bn last month (almost double as much as expected) as high inflation pushed interest payments higher. This trend will likely continue, but the bulk of the announced fiscal easing is time limited, which should only lead to a temporary impact on borrowing.
Therefore, although the near-term prospects do look better for the UK economy, there is a risk that such measures could lengthen the period of weak growth and reduce the capacity for the government to intervene further down the line.
In terms of market reaction, UK assets are reflecting a lot of this pervasive uncertainty and the growing balance of payments issues. Gilt yields have been surging (5-year yields rose as much at 50bps today) while the pound has continued to weaken against the dollar to its lowest level since 1985 (at 1.11 GBP/USD). And although the sterling has felt a lot of pain already, it is difficult to see a clear path higher in the short-term given that the UK has the highest inflation rate in the G10, a weakening growth outlook, falling investor confidence and weak capital inflows.
Meanwhile, the UK equity market has outperformed globally this year thanks to a weaker pound that has benefitted exporters and the index’s higher weighting towards energy and interest-rate sensitive sectors. However, given that the UK economy still faces significant risks, we prefer to allocate to other areas in Europe (like France) over the UK, and the U.S. over Europe in general.
The Tax Plan
The government previously announced a package of proposed reforms to capital allowances and R&D tax reliefs for businesses to encourage additional investment which has lagged our OECD competitors for a number of years. Prior to the leadership election we had anticipated more detail in the Budget in the Autumn. The government has committed to continue the review, with any further reforms announced at a future fiscal event.
In summary
This not so “mini-budget” comes at a crucial time of change for the country. It marks the most significant tax cuts in decades and a drastic shift from the policies of the past 12 years of Conservative government. Undoubtedly, the funding for the cuts and the support for winter energy bills will need to come from somewhere, in the short term this will be funded by increased borrowing. The hope of the Chancellor is that his policies outlined above will drive the growth needed in order to fund that borrowing. How successful it will be will remain to be seen and will be one of the main tests of the new Prime Minister and her Chancellor.

Even the most sophisticated individuals hold common misconceptions about trusts.
Here, we hope to dispel three of the most widely held myths so that, if and when you choose to establish a trust, you are sure to make the best possible choices for you and your family.
Myth #1: My family member will make a great trustee
It may be true that a respected family member is intelligent, knowledgeable, organized, responsible, sensitive and financially secure enough to act as the trustee of a trust you create to support your beneficiaries.
But before you name the family member as the trustee (that is to say, before you make this person alone responsible for the trust that will support your children, grandchildren and legacy), consider these three questions:
Do you and the family member understand the impact that acting as a trustee can have on a person’s life?
Are you sure you want to lay such a burden on someone you care about?
Have you looked into naming a corporate trustee but giving the family member power to oversee, remove and replace the corporate trustee?
Most people do not fully realize what a considerable undertaking acting as a sole trustee can be. Nor do they anticipate the difficult decisions that trustees routinely face and the tensions that making those decisions can generate.
Trustees are legally responsible—and they are personally liable—for handling the trust’s investments, safeguarding trust assets, recordkeeping, tax filings and interpreting the trust, as well as making necessary disclosures and distributions to beneficiaries.
A trustee needs specialized knowledge to comply properly with these requirements. It’s not always simple to make distributions according to a trust document’s stipulations. Beneficiaries don’t always like decisions trustees are obliged to make. Well-intentioned mistakes are all too common.
One example: A trust required payment of beneficiaries’ educational expenses. One beneficiary attended an expensive private college with an annual tuition of more than $60,000, while another went to a state school charging half as much. The trustee, a family friend, sought to preserve family harmony by distributing the cost differential to the state school attendee—only to find that such a distribution violated his duty as the trust’s fiduciary. Family gatherings suddenly became extremely uncomfortable for all—especially when the private college attendee sued the family friend personally to recover the distributed funds.
How might you avoid such problems?
Many find it wise to name a corporate trustee instead—with a family member overseeing the trustee. The family member can oversee, remove and replace the corporate trustee, but isn’t burdened with the same risk and fiduciary duty, and can still ensure the corporate trustee is effectively fulfilling its duty. Another solution is for the trustee to hire a trust company as “agent for trustee"", allowing the trustee to pass on certain administrative responsibilities to experienced professionals.
A corporate fiduciary can also act as a buffer between your personal trustee and beneficiaries. (For example, a corporate trust officer might be charged with having difficult conversations, such as delivering news that a beneficiary’s requested distribution is outside the scope of a trust’s provisions.)
Of course, many trust creators mistakenly believe choosing a family member to be the trustee is more cost-effective, as they’ll often be willing to perform the duties at no cost. However, once the family member hires all the accountants, attorneys, financial advisors and administrators to carry out the necessary duties, the aggregate cost is often higher (and less controllable) than it would have been to simply hire a corporate trustee.
Myth #2: It’s tough to get distributions from a corporate trustee
Trust creators may wonder: “Will a corporate trustee take the time to know the beneficiaries of my trust and understand their needs?"" And: “Will a firm’s bureaucracy make it cumbersome for my beneficiaries to access the trust funds to which they’re entitled?”
First, nondiscretionary distributions are automatic. If the trust says a beneficiary is to receive mandatory net income, those distributions are required and must be distributed to the beneficiary as specified in the trust.
To understand how discretionary distributions might be handled, you’ll want to look carefully at the firm you might name as corporate trustee or agent for trustee.
You might ask the firm to detail:
How much communication is common between beneficiaries and trust officers?
Does the firm welcome “
letters of wishes
”?
How many people are involved in distribution decisions, and how much time does it actually take, routinely, for the firm to fulfill a request for discretionary distribution that is in line with a trust agreement?
Getting complete answers to such questions—with examples and commitments—will give you the peace of mind that your beneficiaries will be supported the way your trust agreement says they should be.
Myth #3: A corporate trustee can’t manage a trust that has illiquid assets
Trust creators used to worry that if they put their businesses, art collections, real estate and such into a trust that a corporate trustee’s legal obligation to avoid concentrations would force them to sell those assets.
But trust law has evolved dramatically in the last 20 years. Now, as a creator of a trust, you have options both within directed and discretionary trust scenarios.
Directed trusts
The laws of some states, such as Delaware, have become so flexible that you can break up the trust functions among multiple parties. That means responsibility for specific trustee functions such as investment management or, say, distributions, can be given to another person or committee (often a family member or close connection).
Many families opt for a directed trust, as it gives them a great deal of control over heirloom assets. For example, if the asset is an art collection, the investment manager would make all decisions about holding, selling, insuring, maintaining and loaning the art. The corporate trustee then would carry out the directions of the investment advisor with respect to those decisions.
At the same time, a directed trust provides the family with the benefit of a corporate trustee’s experience and administrative expertise (handling, for example, the tax work, bookkeeping and communications to beneficiaries). Having a corporate trustee also helps with continuity, as a corporate trustee does not age out of the position as individuals do.
Discretionary trusts
Trustees have a duty to invest a portfolio prudently, which includes a duty to diversify investment portfolios. At J.P. Morgan, we generally ask that no single asset (such as real property) is more than 10% of the total assets in a trust.
A trust document might be worded so that it relieves the trustee of the duty to diversify specific assets. Your J.P. Morgan team would be happy to work with your attorney on appropriate enabling language.
In addition, you might want to look into the benefits of having our experienced specialists manage the real estate, oil and gas interests, or closely held entities that are held in trust.
Stay up-to-date. We can help.
After you’ve established and funded your trust with a structure and trustees that work for you, it is extremely important that you check regularly to make sure everything continues to operate as you intended, and that life events haven’t made some of your trust’s terms obsolete.

Morgan team can help you and your estate planning lawyers review your options and holdings, and their projected growth, to help you make sure your estate plan and trusts are supporting the goals you have for yourself—and for all of your loved ones.Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.

Global markets have had to digest a lot of bad news in a very short period:
The latest inflation data continue to decimate the “inflation is purely transitory” theory
1
.  After pricing in less than one Fed hike as of last September, markets and Fed watchers now expect between 6 and 7 hikes over the next year, with some arguing for a 50 basis point move and not just 25
Europe’s energy dependence on Russia
2
could cause another surge in its electricity and other energy costs if Russia were to invade the Ukraine, in which case the US might launch a very wide array of sanctions
US supply chains have not resolved themselves as fast as some market participants hoped (see Appendix)
This is a lot for markets to digest in a short period; YTD, global equity indices are down 3%-10% and most global fixed income indices are down 3%-4%.  In this note, we examine market risk unwind measures, the likely ability of corporate revenues to keep pace with rising input costs, an update on supply chains, my shrinking network of trusted research contacts and some thoughts on the Ukraine and the road not taken.If you missed it, we published a piece on cryptocurrencies and blockchains called the “
Maltese Falcoin
” on February 3.  Press reactions focused almost solely on the store of value topic and not on the arguably more interesting question of whether widely discussed use cases for blockchains will end up being satisfied by stablecoins (perhaps issued by Central Banks), and by permissioned, private blockchains that also have little to no implications for directional crypto valuations.  Since our piece came out: the SEC is reportedly negotiating a $100 million fine with DeFi lender BlockFi for selling unregistered securities to customers, and there’s more evidence that NFT buyers may be able to transact with fiat currency instead of having to buy Ethereum tokens.
Let’s start with some risk unwind measures
. The first chart shows an estimate from JP Morgan Global Market Strategy Research on the large overweight position that investors hold in credit that built up over the last decade
3
. This can be laid at the doorstep of the Fed for engineering the longest period of negative real rates since the 1860’s. Unfortunately, the unwind of the credit overweight has a long way to go.
The equity repricing is further along
. The second chart shows the decline in stocks heavily owned by retail investors, whose returns are now converging back to the S&P 500. As for the S&P, its forward P/E valuations have declined from peak levels along negative 10 year real interest rates; although to be clear, valuations are still high in any historical context. The fourth chart shows something even more striking: the average stock in the NASDAQ is now down 42% from its peak, with many down 70% or more.  The fifth chart shows other low water marks: I’m unsurprised that the SPAC market and its gaggle of adversely selected IPOs marked the beginning of the end for overpriced stocks, and for repricing of renewable and fintech stocks as well.
If we do get a 50 bps Fed hike in March and some additional equity market capitulation, that could represent an attractive equity market entry point.
We’re getting closer to one now even without that.The good news for investors
:
the impact of rising input costs on profits may be overstated
. As shown below in some interesting work from Empirical Research, there is almost a 1:1 connection between rising costs of goods sold (which includes most labor costs) and rising revenues over the last 70 years. The link between rising SG&A expenses and revenues is strong as well, although not as tight as the link with COGS.  What does this all mean?
Rising costs by themselves do not result in lower margins and poor equity market returns
; from 1987 to 2022, equity market returns were almost identical regardless of the level of median wage growth
4
.
The more important question is whether a recession is coming, which is way more predictive of a deeper sustained rout in equity markets.
And on that front, I do not see a recession in the cards for 2022
. I still think US real GDP growth will be ~3% this year as production rises to match higher levels of consumption. The latest capital spending surveys still point in this direction.Obviously, a Ukraine invasion could interrupt a capital spending recovery and destabilize markets
. A lot would depend on what sanctions are adopted. Here are the kind of sanctions reportedly contemplated by the US:
Export controls to prevent countries from selling products with US content to Russia (Huawei penalty)
Adding Russian companies and individuals to a “prohibited transactions list” with US individuals, companies and specifically banks
Prohibitions on US securities firms from underwriting or transacting in Russian sovereign debt
Blocking Russia from transacting in the Swift payments network
Delaying the Nord Stream 2 pipeline
The full imposition of this list could be very disruptive for markets, at least in the short term, given likely Russian retaliation via energy supplies. I’m dubious of Europe’s ability to withstand a protracted two-sided sanctions and trade war with Russia given its energy dependence cited earlier.
On the Ukraine itself
, last weekend I reread John Mearsheimer’s essay from 2014 in Foreign Affairs magazine, entitled “
Why the Ukraine Crisis Is the West’s Fault: The Liberal Delusions That Provoked Putin
”
5
. The piece reviews how we got here and what policy options might have been chosen instead.
The story begins with the Clinton Administration’s NATO enlargement in the 1990’s, an expansion of more territory than French, German and Italian land mass combined.  Mearsheimer cites George Kennan, an architect of the US post-war policy of Soviet containment, on NATO’s enlargement in 1998: “I think the Russians will gradually react quite adversely and it will affect their policies. I think it’s a tragic mistake. There was no reason for this whatsoever. No one was threatening anyone else”. Ten years later in 2008, NATO leaders announced that “Georgia and Ukraine would become members of NATO”. The Russians made clear at the time that red lines had been crossed, which the US and Europeans mostly ignored. In 2013, the president of a US-bankrolled organization working in the Ukraine to draw it into the Western orbit wrote in the Washington Post, “Ukraine’s choice to join Europe will accelerate the demise of the ideology of Russian imperialism that Putin represents. Russians, too, face a choice, and Putin may find himself on the losing end not just abroad but within Russia itself.”  These predictions have not aged well.
Since the 1990’s, there has been a battle between Liberalism and Realism in Western foreign policy circles on the Ukraine
. Depending upon what happens now to the Ukraine, which the West has made clear it will not defend militarily
6
, the Realists might turn out to be right. That’s why Mearsheimer concluded in his essay that some sort of “Finlandization” of the Ukraine would be a better outcome for all sides.NATO enlargement

What should I do when a research firm whose work I respect, value and pay for ventures into irresponsible and poorly vetted COVID commentary? Like the 1956 film
Invasion of the Body Snatchers
, seemingly normal individuals start behaving strangely and all of a sudden, they become pod people. The latest episode involves a firm whose work I often cite. In a recent public note and email exchange, one of its principal authors argued the following:
[A] COVID vaccines may not work that well.
Yes, data from health agencies across the developed world show much higher hospitalization, ICU and mortality outcomes for unvaccinated people. But this data is unreliable, mostly since unvaccinated cohorts are not comparable to vaccinated ones. Why? A large number of unvaccinated people are frail, sicker individuals with cancer and heart conditions that prevent them from being vaccinated even if they want to be!
There is so much that’s wrong here. First, COVID vaccines work very well in the elderly, the sick and most immunocompromised people; that’s why there are very few for whom COVID vaccines are not recommended
Second, their description of the unvaccinated is completely off-base. The unvaccinated in the US tend to be younger people whose decisions are driven by lack of trust in the gov’t, lack of trust in vaccines, the belief that vaccines are unnecessary and concerns about myocarditis and other side effects
7
. In the UK, people are vaccinated and boosted in order of their age and vulnerability (UK vaccines are solely available through the NHS). As a result, the UK vaccinated cohort is
more
frail and elderly than the unvaccinated
My contacts at the Scripps Institute for biomedical sciences described their assertions as “patently false and unsupported by data”, and contacts at the La Jolla Institute of Immunology described them as “silly/bogus”
[B] Difficulty in measuring flu vaccine efficacy is also proof that COVID vaccine efficacy figures are not reliable
. The healthier two thirds of a typical retirement home get the flu vaccine while the weakest third are told by their doctors to not take the flu vaccine. As a result, deaths are disproportionally higher in the weak third than in the healthier two thirds, rendering flu vaccine efficacy measures much less meaningful.  Same for COVID!
Yikes.  First of all, doctors generally do recommend the flu vaccine for frailer adults. It does not provoke a strong antibody response (in part since it has no adjuvant), and it’s extremely well tolerated by the aged and frail
Second, according to a Professor of Epidemiology I contacted at Harvard’s School of Public Health, flu and COVID vaccine efficacy error terms are not comparable.  Flu vaccine efficacy can be difficult to measure
8
. But the same is much less true for COVID; for reasons related to genetic testing and identifiable variants, COVID vaccine efficacy studies yield results that are very similar to more rigorous randomized control trials and observational studies with strict controls. Bottom line: a “flippant and facile” comparison with little basis in actual scientific data
[C] Why are COVID mortality rates so much higher in the developed world than in the developing world whose vaccination rates are so much lower?
Another sign that COVID vaccines don’t work well!
If you can use Google, it would take you all of 5 minutes to see why this comment is so poorly informed, and callous as well. Overall death rates in many EM nations have been
much
higher than normal. According to most demographers, these elevated death rates are picking up COVID mortality that country health agencies are not properly identifying.  See charts on the following page for estimates of actual COVID mortality levels
So, what will I do with their research now?
I will still read it since their work is generally good. That said, my prior unquestioned confidence in their work is gone, and I will do a lot more checking and verifying. As for any personal relationships with their researchers, those might be gone too. mRNA vaccines are estimated to have saved one million lives in the US in 2021
9
, and I trust the people who work on such estimates a lot more than people creating their own narratives as they go along. As I get older, my personal world is shrinking. I distance myself from people on the far right and the far left, and now I distance myself from people who use stylized pseudo-facts and sloppy research to push a given agenda. Life is too short for that.

Estimating COVID mortality
In many countries, strained healthcare systems are unable to accurately track COVID deaths. More than 100 countries do not collect reliable statistics on expected or actual deaths at all, or do not release them in a timely manner. Some demographers estimate COVID deaths by looking at deaths from all causes vs trend, rather than just at reported COVID deaths. The first chart compares the two; the farther above the line a country is, the more its excess deaths in 2020 exceeded reported COVID deaths. Many of the highest outliers are EM countries.
The second set of charts shows estimates of COVID mortality derived from a machine learning model. Again, estimated COVID death levels for lower middle income countries are much higher than reported ones, despite the fact that many of these countries have average population ages that are far below US and European levels (a key factor affecting COVID mortality). No approach is perfect, and demographers argue over models; but they all agree that developing country COVID deaths are massively underreported.
So, if you ask why the EM world has much lower death rates despite less vaccination, all that shows is a lack of understanding of basic pandemic research, even now two full years after the pandemic began.Source: “
The pandemic’s true death toll: millions more than official counts
”, Nature, January 2022Appendix: supply chain conditions still very tight, some signs of modest improvement from peak levels1
Inflation is not just a US phenomenon
. From the JP Morgan Economics Research Global Data Watch, February 11, 2022: “Across countries, the sharp rise in core inflation in the Euro area and EM Asia (ex. China and India) is most notable. An acceleration in food and services price inflation points to pressures extending well beyond items closely linked to the pandemic. US measures of inflation breadth have moved substantially higher and align with evidence of rising wage inflation”.

As we illustrate each year in our Energy paper,
Europe imports roughly the same amount of oil and gas from Russia as it produces for itself
. There is perhaps no greater difference between Europe and the US than the question of energy dependence.

When the Ukraine abandoned its nuclear weapons 30 years ago, the
Budapest Memorandum
offered Ukraine security assurances against the future use of force by the US, UK and Russia. But the Memorandum only required signatories to raise any issues with the UN Security Council; it was not a defense treaty and the US has stated in the past that it is not legally binding.

MR. MICHAEL CEMBALEST:
Good afternoon, and welcome to the Eye on the Market podcast.  This is Michael Cembalest.  A couple weeks ago, we issued a piece on cryptocurrencies and the blockchain.  It’s called The Maltese Falcoin.  You can find a link to it in today’s piece, or you can get it from the people you talk to at J.P. Morgan.  In this Eye on the Market, we’re going to look at the fact that the markets have had a lot of negative news to digest in a pretty short period here.  After pricing in less than one Fed hike last September, the markets now expect between six and seven hikes over the last year.  I can’t remember the last time over three months the markets went from expecting no hikes to expecting six or seven.  And some people are arguing for a 50-basis-point hike and not just 25.
On top of that, the U.S. supply chain situation hasn’t really resolved itself as fast as some of us had hoped.  And now we have the situation in the Ukraine that the markets are adjusting to as well.  And there are a lot of issues here related to European energy dependence and a possible U.S. sanction bazooka with a very wide range of impacts.  So we’re going to take a look in this note at global equity indices, which are down 3 to 10% this year, and the fact that a lot of the global fixed income indices are down 3 to 4% as well.
So let’s start by talking about some of these market risk unwind measures.  The first chart in today’s piece is from the Global Market Strategy Group in the Investment Bank at J.P. Morgan.  They estimated the implied credit in overweight, in other words the overweight the credit positions in corporate bonds, high yield bonds that investors have.  And it’s at a very high level, and it’s just beginning to unwind.  We all knew that this day was coming, and now it looks like it’s finally here.  This one can be laid at the doorstep of the Fed for engineering the longest period of negative real interest rates in probably 150 years.  In any case, the unwind of this fixed income credit overweight has a long way to go.
The equity repricing I think is a little bit further along.  Stocks that were heavily favored by retail investors have come crashing down.  Valuations on the S&P have fallen let’s say three multiple points from their peak levels, although they’re still on the expensive side.  On the NASDAQ, the average stock is down to around 40% from peak levels, with a lot of the stocks down 70% or more.  And we’re really seeing some carnage in SPACs and renewables and fintech and things like that.  If we get a 50-basis-point Fed hike in March and some additional equity market capitulation, that could represent a reasonably attractive equity market entry point.  And we might be getting closer to one now, even without that.
The good news for investors is that the impact of rising input costs on profits, sorry about the noise, the impact of rising input costs on profits might be overstated.  ‘Cause one of the things that we’re following is how are all of these rising labor, commodity, and interest costs going to affect margins and revenues?  Over the last 70 years, there’s been a remarkably close connection between rising costs and rising revenues, in part because one person’s rising costs are somebody else’s revenues.
And it’s amazing when you look at this, and the same thing holds for rising SG&A expenses and revenues, the link is pretty strong as well.  And what that tells us is that rising costs by themselves don’t result in lower profit margins and poor equity returns.  If you look over the last few decades, equity market returns are almost identical regardless of the level of wage growth that was going on, in part because wage growth pushed up aggregate corporate revenues as well.
So the more important question is whether a recession’s coming.  And that’s way more predictive of a deeper and more sustained route in equity markets.  And on that front, I don’t see a recession in the cards this year.  I still think GDP growth is going to be around 3%.  Production is still struggling to catch up to higher levels of consumption.  And the latest capital spending surveys that we see are still pointing in this direction.
Now of course in the near term, a Ukrainian invasion could be very destabilizing.  A lot would depend on what kind of sanctions get adopted.  The U.S. is apparently talking about some pretty severe ones, export controls to prevent countries, other countries from selling products with U.S. content to Russia, which is essentially the Huawei penalty, putting Russian companies and individuals on prohibited transactions lists, particularly for U.S. banks, prohibiting U.S. securities firms from either underwriting or even transacting in Russian sovereign debt, blocking Russia from the SWIFT payments network.  And then trying to further delay the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.
The full imposition of all of this, of these sanctions could be pretty disruptive, at least in the short term, given the likely Russian retaliation in terms of energy supplies.  I’m a little dubious of Europe’s ability to withstand a protracted two-sided sanctions war here.  Russia exports a lot of energy as we all know to Europe.  And the latest numbers we’ve been tracking is that Europe produces around the same amount of oil and gas for itself as it imports from Russia.  That probably is the biggest difference, of all the ways of describing differences between the U.S. and Europe, energy dependence is maybe the biggest one.  And just to reiterate, Europe is as reliable on Russia for its energy as it is on itself.  And so with that kind of backdrop, I think it’s right to wonder how assiduously Europe would stick to any kind of protracted sanctions war with Russia.
On the Ukraine itself, last weekend I reread an essay that I had saved from 2014 in Foreign Affairs magazine from John Mearsheimer at the University of Chicago.  And you can kind of tell where he’s going where he says the Ukraine crisis is the West’s fault, the liberal delusions that provoked Putin.  It’s an interesting read; I didn’t agree with all of it.  You probably won’t agree with all of it.  But it does lay out some facts that are important to understand.  The story begins with the Clinton administration’s NATO enlargement in the 1990s, an amount of enlargement in terms of land that was larger than aggregate French, German, and Italian land mass combined.  So this was a large enlargement to the East.
And for those of you that remember George Kennan from college, where we all studied him, he was an architect of the post-war policy of containment of the Soviet Union, when this NATO enlargement began happening, Mearsheimer quotes Kennan as saying, and here’s a quote, “I think the Russians will react quite adversely to this, and it will affect their policies.  I think this is a tragic mistake.  There was no reason for this whatsoever.  No one was threatening anybody else.”  And then ten years later, NATO announced that Georgia and the Ukraine would become members.  The Russians made it clear at the time that certain red lines had been crossed, the Europeans and the U.S. ignored them, and then here we are.
So the bottom line is that since the 1990s, there’s been this battle between liberalism and realism in the Western foreign policy circles on this whole question of the Ukraine.  And depending upon what happens now, particularly since the West has made it clear that it will not militarily defend the Ukraine, the realists might turn out to be right.  And that’s why Mearsheimer had concluded in his essay at the time that some kind of Finlandization of the Ukraine would be a better outcome for all sides.  If you don’t know what Finlandization means, it means what it sounds like.  But you can look it up, and there’s a lot of history to it.
We have an appendix this week on supply chain conditions.  They are still pretty tight.  There are some signs of modest improvements from peak levels.  But whether it’s whole issue of the notorious container ships in LA and Long Beach, as we have discussed before, some of the worst-run ports in the world, or you’re looking at container freight rates, or you’re looking at global manufacturing delivery times, air freight rates, shipping rates, demand for trucks, the supply chain delays are alive and well, unfortunately.  And it looks like it’s going to take a few more months for them to settle down.  We thought they would start really settling down by May or June, but I was hoping for a little bit more progress on some of these things than we’ve seen so far.
The last topic this week is a dilemma that I want to share with you.  So here’s the dilemma.  What should I do when a research firm, I read a lot of research, probably 1,000 to 1,500 pages of research a week, what should I do when a research firm whose work I generally respect and also pay for starts writing irresponsible and unsubstantiated COVID stuff?  And it’s like The Invasion of the Body Snatchers movie from 1956.  You have normal people.  They’re walking around, and all of a sudden the pods get them, and they become crazy.
The latest episode involves one of the research firms that I often cite their work in the Eye on the Market.  In a recent research note, one of their principal authors argued three things.  Number one, COVID vaccines probably don’t work well.  And that all the data that we’ve been showing on higher hospitalization and mortality outcomes from unvaccinated people, that data is unreliable because unvaccinated groups are not comparable to vaccinated groups.  Why, you may ask?  Well, according to this logic, a lot of unvaccinated people are frail and sicker.  They have cancer and heart conditions that prevent them from being vaccinated even if they wanted to be.
I am not making this up.  He’s actually arguing that the cohort composition differences are so huge that they render all of the data that comes from the CDC and the other health organizations around the entire developed world, all that stuff is useless, and all of those health agencies are wasting their time sharing this information.
Now this is of course nonsense.  The unvaccinated people in the U.S. are not generally frail and sicker and older.  They’re younger people whose decisions are driven according to all the studies, by lack of trust in government, lack of trust in the vaccines, they don’t think they need the vaccines, and then concerns about myocarditis and other side effects.  And in the U.K., people get vaccinated and boosted in order of their age and vulnerability.  So the vaccinated group is more frail and elderly than the unvaccinated one.  So that’s probably why when I showed this to some people I know at Scripps Research Institute for Biomedical Sciences, they said that their claims were patently false and unsupported by the data.
There was another line of, the second of the three.  Well, since it’s hard to measure flu vaccine efficacy, that means COVID vaccine efficacy figures are not reliable as well.  And in retirement homes, it’s only the healthy ones that get the flu vaccine and the weakest ones don’t.  So therefore the deaths are disproportionately higher in the weaker third.  I reached out to some people that I know at the La Jolla Institute of Immunology.  They just described this line of thinking as silly.  There are very few people for whom COVID vaccines are not recommended.  And by the way, doctors generally do recommend the flu vaccine for frailer adults.  The flu vaccine is not very immunogenic, which it has no adjuvant, which is why the efficacy numbers are so low.  And it’s so very well tolerated by the aged and frail.  So the unsupported facts and assertions just keep piling up.
And then the third one, the third thing that this particular author pointed out was well, if COVID vaccines work so well, why are COVID mortality rates so much higher in the developed world than in the developing world, whose vaccination rates are so much lower?  If you can use Google, which everybody knows is a search engine, it would take you all of five minutes to see why this comment is so poorly informed.  The death rates in a lot of emerging market countries have been much higher than normal.  The overall death rates in the country, not the COVID-reported ones, but the overall death rates.
And according to most demographers who spend their lives looking at this, these elevated overall death rates are picking up COVID mortality that the country health agencies are unable to identify.  And there’s been tons of research on this.  And we have a chart in here that shows total mortality versus reported COVID mortality.  And of course, the big outliers are mostly emerging market countries where the health agencies are strained and unable to accurately track the COVID deaths.  So all I have to say about that is if you’re asking why the EM world has much lower death rates, despite lower vaccination, all that shows is that you don’t understand basic pandemic research two years into the pandemic.
And so what am I going to do about their research now?  I’ll probably still read it since it’s generally pretty good.  But my unquestioned confidence in their work is gone.  And any personal relationships with their researchers are probably gone too, as I find that as I get older, my personal world is shrinking.  I distance myself from people on the far right.  I distance myself from people on the far left.  And now I’m distancing myself from people who use garbage facts and sloppy research to push an agenda.  Life is too short for that.  Anyway, thank you very much for tuning in this week.  And I look forward to speaking to you all next time.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.This year, you’ll want to start getting your financial house in order as early in the fall as possible.Sarah Backer, Wealth Planning Strategy
Amanda Lott, Head of Wealth Planning Strategy
With so many stressors affecting personal finances now—higher market volatility, interest rates and inflation—we recommend that you take control by beginning your 2022 year-end planning as early as possible this fall.
Give yourself time to consider all your options and to make decisions that will best serve you and your family.
To help you in this effort, we offer these 10 tips.
Make sure you’re on the right track
1.
Take a good look at how you felt this year.
Last year, the market enjoyed many highs, but in 2022 it has been on more of a rollercoaster. How did you feel about your portfolio this year? Behavioral scientists remind us that we all tend to feel losses more than gains, and that uncertainty is unsettling; a year of volatility naturally leads many to second guess their investing strategies.
Now may be a good time to take a fresh look at whether your portfolio matches your
real
risk tolerance and whether or not market volatility actually does put your financial goals at risk—or if it just
feels
like it does.
2. Analyze your portfolio and financial plan.
Does your strategy still work toward your goals? Make any tweaks needed, but don’t be blinded by any short-term volatility. Keep your eyes on the long term. Focus your equity investments on high-quality companies with strong balance sheets and sustainable earnings. Consider active managers that might reduce your portfolio’s volatility and help it outperform.
3. Determine how much cash you should hold.
Higher interest rates mean it’s more important to look at where you’re keeping your liquidity. Today’s CDs, money markets and fixed income products now may offer you more yield than cash, which can help offset inflation’s drain on your dollar’s value. So identify how much cash you really need for your operating cash flow, as a psychological safety net, to fund large capital expenditures or so that you have “dry powder” for opportunistic investments.
Then, as you put
excess cash
into longer-term investments, you may want to set up an additional safety net by establishing a portfolio line of credit. Even if you never use it, having access to funds can create peace of mind and avoid having to sell investments at the wrong time.
Strengthen your finances
4. Assess your life insurance needs and policies.
If you have life insurance policies, review them to make sure they still are in good health and will work to support your financial goals and estate plans. Market volatility and crediting rate or dividend rate changes can deplete some policies’ cash value and create risk for you that the policy will not maintain its expected cash value or, later, its death benefit.
If you would like to review your policy or don’t have life insurance in place, speak with your J.P. Morgan team about whether policy adjustments or additions would be advisable. Many people with illiquid estates have life insurance to pay the estate tax. Life insurance also can be beneficial for wealth transfer, business owners, and as part of a portfolio of financial assets.
5. Improve your portfolio’s tax efficiency.
We expect markets to deliver more modest returns and experience greater volatility during the next decade or so. As a result, saving on taxes is more critical. First, make sure your assets are in the right types of accounts, as having an asset in the right place can dramatically affect your tax exposure. The general rule is that you want to hold tax-inefficient assets inside tax-advantaged accounts such as a 401(k) account or IRA. To see the types of assets that work best in these accounts, see our article
here
.
In addition, accounts that are built to continually harvest tax losses can help you keep more of your returns.
6. Complete any annual to-dos.
Every year, some things need to be completed before year-end to maximize tax efficiency in furtherance of individuals’ financial goals. Here’s a short checklist for you to see which might apply to your circumstances:
Retirement accounts
—Make sure you fully fund retirement accounts to take advantage of their tax-deferral benefits, and consider whether you want to convert traditional IRAs to Roths
RMDs
—If you must take required minimum distributions, take those before year-end; otherwise, you will face a hefty penalty
Gifting
—Consider whether you want to make annual exclusion gifts to family members or make charitable donations
Fiduciaries and trust distributions
—Investigate whether it makes sense to change trustee or other fiduciary appointments, or time distributions thoughtfully, so your trusts are as income-tax-efficient as possible
Private foundations
—if you have a private foundation, you’ll want to make sure it has fulfilled its 5% annual distribution requirement
7. Prepare yourself for higher interest rates.
Rates have risen steadily this year; more hikes may come. It’s a good time to focus on core fixed income as a portfolio ballast against adverse economic outcomes.
If you are considering wealth transfer strategies such as grantor retained annuity trusts (GRATs), intra-family loans, and charitable lead annuity trusts (CLATs), look to fund these soon (i.e., before any additional rate hikes).
By historical standards, borrowing rates are still relatively low. However, there may be a way to reduce your effective borrowing cost. If you’re thinking of buying a home, you might consider paying for it in cash, and sometime later borrowing against the fully paid-up residence, using the proceeds for investments. Doing so would allow you to classify interest on the loan as “investment interest”—which you can deduct fully against your investment income. By contrast, interest classified as “qualified residence interest” is generally limited to interest on no more than $750,000 of acquisition debt.
Help the people and causes you care about
8.
Measure your gifting capacity.
First, quantify your gifting capacity so you can gift confidently without impairing your own financial future. Then consider all your options.
Volatile markets create a great opportunity to gift “beaten up” assets directly to family members (or in trusts for their benefit). Gifting battered assets before they rebound would move any future appreciation off your balance sheet. You can potentially gain an even greater benefit by gifting illiquid assets (such as shares of a private business) at depressed values in order to receive additional discounts.
If you want to donate to charity, consider giving to a charitable vehicle such as a donor-advised fund (DAF). A DAF can offer flexibility if you’re looking for a way to streamline your gifting or “pre-fund” many years of charitable giving in a high-income year when the deduction might serve you best.
9. Connect with family.
Plan now to hold a family meeting during the upcoming holidays. Use the meeting to reconnect with family members, share family values, provide an update on family finances, and discuss hopes and aspirations for the short and long terms.
You may want to take time to discuss this year’s historic market volatility with the entire family—but especially with the younger members who’ve experienced only bull markets in their lives as investors. Help children and grandchildren
make a plan for their lives
that sets them up for future success and communicates your expectations.
10. Reinforce your cybersecurity.
We often see more cyberattacks and attempted fraud during volatile times. Scams have become very sophisticated and prey on our natural willingness to be helpful. Your defenses also must evolve, especially as your attention is pulled in different directions during the holidays. To learn more about how to protect yourself, your family and your business from cybercriminals, please contact your J.P. Morgan team.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Making deliberate choices now can help create the legacy you envision—and may avoid unintended consequencesPeople understand that they should organize their money with intent—but why is doing it such a different story? Many of us know what we should do, but that often conflicts with what we want to do. Think about this: Would you rather have a piece of cake or go on a run? It’s not even a close call.
Similarly, most of us know that we should prepare for the future. That includes making plans for assets that will endure beyond our lifetime. But it’s so much easier to focus on the present. Today’s temptations have a much greater pull than emotionally distant benefits in the future. Behavioral scientists refer to this phenomenon as “present bias.”
Research suggests that pre-committing to what we should be doing can restrain our natural impulse to do what we want to do in the moment—Default settings, early withdrawal penalties, automatic savings apps, a workout buddy – these are all proven techniques to help us pre-commit. And that pre-commitment planning is what our “bucket” approach to goals-based advice is all about.
Previously we’ve explored two of the common buckets in a goals-based plan. In the
liquidity bucket
, you’ll want enough money to cover operating cash flow, near-term large capital expenditures and opportunistic investments. In the
lifestyle bucket
we recommend setting aside money to meet the spending needs that you and your family will have over your lifetime.
This third bucket, the legacy bucket, poses a particular challenge. That’s because it contains money for our heirs and beneficiaries—which we hope they’ll receive well into the future. When we plan for this bucket, none of our decisions have tangible, immediate consequences. Further, we know that we should make plans for beyond our lifetime, but most of us would rather not imagine a world without us.
How can we get past that natural hesitation and plan for the legacy we want to leave? This article provides a framework for thinking about these issues and a practical guide to getting where you want to go.
The power of intent in building a legacy
When you pass, you will leave behind a lot. Memories, meaning, business, personal and social impact and lessons and love for your friends, family and community. This is your legacy, often hard to measure, shape or control.
A big part of your legacy, however, is something more tangible and easier to control—a collection of assets. The money has to go to specific people, organizations or entities. If you do nothing, those assets will be transferred to others by default, often according to your local jurisdiction’s laws. This could result in your assets being administered by people ill-equipped to do so or being passed to people you may not wish to benefit.
You can choose to be intentional, making deliberate choices based on your personal values and goals. You might divide your assets among beneficiaries who will receive your wealth upon your death. Or you could structure your wealth to be preserved and sustained across several generations beyond your lifetime.
It helps to think about the people who will receive the assets. Research shows that thinking about how our decisions affect others can motivate us to be more intentional.
1
Identifying who you want to benefit from your assets—think of it as a gift—can be a constructive starting point for taking action.
So here you are. You have accumulated a significant store of assets that you want to give away. Before jumping into all of the details, try to picture the future in as much detail as you can. Consider it an opportunity to take control, shape the future and create your legacy. What impact do you want your assets to have on your family and community? In an ideal world, how does the future unfold?
Questions to ask: Who, what, when, how?
With that in mind, now you can flesh out the details. Here are four questions to ask yourself:
Who
is the money meant for?
Your spouse, partner, children, future generations or other important people in your life?
Specifically when it comes to leaving assets to children, some people feel that it will be empowering for their children to receive all, or part of their accumulated wealth. Others feel that inheriting significant wealth would actually disempower their children. So identifying who will receive your assets is a critical first step.
What
exactly are you giving?
You might have a mix of belongings, investments, real estate and businesses. What are they worth now and what might they be worth in the future? What portion of your assets do you want divided among beneficiaries upon your death and what portion of your assets (a property or business, perhaps) might you want to preserve for multiple generations?
For any treasured possessions that are difficult to literally divide, such as a watch inherited from your father or a piece of art passed down through multiple generations, you’ll need to consider how you communicate your decisions to those receiving these items and—perhaps more importantly—those not receiving them.
When
do you want to make your gift?
Will it be during or after your lifetime? When will the gift begin and when will it end? For example, will there be many distributions to people over a long period of time, or one distribution at a single time (say, when you pass or when the beneficiary reaches a certain age?). Would you enjoy giving during your lifetime so you can see your beneficiaries put the assets to use?
How
should you make your gift to most faithfully reflect your intentions?
For example, do you distribute your wealth equally among your children, or do you choose a different division that you believe will be more appropriate? For many families, fair is not always equal. Other factors such as psychological readiness, financial need and contribution to the family play a large role in perceived fairness in how assets are divided.A legacy-planning checklist
To make your vision a reality, you’ll need to work with your financial, tax and legal advisors. The best-laid plans can be disrupted when important details are overlooked. Here are some tips to consider:
Remember to update your asset titling and beneficiary designations so that assets pass to the intended recipient or entity. Also of critical importance—ensure you have an up-to-date will.
If you plan for any of your assets to remain in a trust, foundation or similar structure carefully think about the governance arrangements for management and control of that entity. Will naming a family member spark conflict? Will that person live long enough to handle the responsibilities? Consider naming a corporate professional entity to facilitate continuity through generations and objective administration of your entity’s terms.
Life insurance can often play an important role in the Legacy bucket - to provide liquidity in an illiquid estate, to offset estate taxes, or as an uncorrelated asset class. Reviewing existing policies regularly to check on their financial health is a sound practice to avoid unintended outcomes (i.e. lapse in policy, additional premium outlay, inclusion in estate).
The timeline and priority level of your gift should dictate how the assets are invested. Generally speaking, the longer the time horizon, the more risk and less liquidity the assets can afford.
Communicating expectations, intentions and distribution policies to beneficiaries
before
distributions are made can go a long way toward engendering a sense of fairness. For example, you may want to have a prenuptial agreement policy or requirements for funds to be disbursed for education expenses.
Finally, keep the beneficiaries in mind. Do they have the required skills to use the assets in accordance with your intentions? Your J.P. Morgan team can help with financial and wealth literacy. Starting education early to give them the longest runway possible is a
prudent approach
. Further, consider writing a
Letter of Wishes
to give context to legal structures and decisions.
Final thoughts
Do you find it hard to think about your legacy? Join the club—the hesitation is entirely natural. Take a deep breath. Then envision your legacy bucket through the lens of who, what, when and how. By thinking about the specifics of your imagined future, and using our four-part framework you can plan for the legacy you want to leave your heirs and beneficiaries.

https://peoplescience.maritz.com/Articles/2018/Generositys-Bottom-LineThis chart brings the legacy bucket to life with three examples. First, an individual gives her two children $20MM of investment assets upon passing. At her death, all monies were distributed with very little structures, since tax, protection and control were secondary factors. Second, another individual gives $10MM of variable annuity and retirement assets to charities over 30 years. The pre-tax assets were left to a charitable giving vehicle and a family council meets to distribute 3% annually to local charities. Lastly, an individual wants to provide investment assets and a family vacation home to grandchildren, great-grandchildren and beyond for approximately 100 years. The vacation home and investments are held in entities for the benefit of bloodline family members with equal annual distributions of investment assets.Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.

The bulk of this note is on China, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the surge in natural gas, oil, coal, electricity, wheat, copper, palladium and other prices which will probably drag Europe into recession, and impose a heavy growth drag on the rest of the world as well. But before getting into it, the chart below should hang in the offices of policymakers everywhere. Energy transitions are inherently slow moving, particularly when citizens of countries adopting them erect NIMBY barriers along the way (a topic we cover in this year’s forthcoming energy paper). As we have discussed often, capital spending by the world’s largest energy companies has fallen 75% from peak levels while global demand for oil, gas and coal are all at or above pre-COVID levels. Countries that reduced their
supply
of thermal energy at a much faster pace than they reduced their
demand
are paying a very stiff price for that right now. We expect some about-face movements on this in the days ahead.

Chairman of Market and Investment Strategy
JP Morgan Asset ManagementAfter issuing an Executive Order banning new oil and gas leases on Federal lands, Biden is now reportedly considering a trip to Saudi Arabia to ask for more crude supply (Source: Axios), his team already visited Venezuela to do the same, and the administration is engaging in “outreach” to the oil and gas industry.  Wow.
China and the Russian invasion of Ukraine
In this note we examine the latest on China’s economy and markets. First, comments on China’s connection to the war in Ukraine since its financial and energy decisions may dilute the effectiveness of sanctions on Russia:
Energy
.  As shown below, Europe and China are large importers of energy while Russia is a large exporter.  So far, Russian gas exports to Europe are down ~15% from 2021 average levels (2nd chart).  But if Europe permanently reduced exposure to Russian gas, China could step in over the next decade.  The Power of Siberia expansion and Sakhalin projects could eventually add ~80 bcm per year to Russia’s gas exports to China, compared to its gas exports to Europe which have averaged ~190 bcm per year since 2017
Trade
. Since Russia’s invasion of Crimea in 2014, Russian-Chinese trade has risen by 50%. Russia is now Beijing's largest recipient of state sector financing, securing 107 loans and export credits worth $125 billion from Chinese state institutions
Currency
. China and Russia began using their own currencies to settle bilateral trade in 2010 and opened a currency swap line in 2014, sharply reducing reliance on the US$ for bilateral trade (3
rd
chart)
Payments
. While China’s Cross-Border Interbank Payment System is mentioned as an alternative to SWIFT, it only processed 13,000 transactions per day in Q4 of last year compared to 41 million per day for SWIFT
UN
. I’m not sure it matters, but China abstained from condemning Russia at the UN
As a reminder of how China’s geopolitical lens often differs from the West, since 2010 it has been North Korea’s almost sole trade counterparty (4
th
chart). We searched through all 40,000 bilateral trade combinations in the world and there is none as high as North Korean trade reliance on China.Before we get further into China, some comments on “shock treatment” plans advanced by the IEA to wean Europe off of Russian energy. It is VERY ambitious:
“
Diversify gas suppliers”?
That may drive prices up by narrowing European supply but not global demand. Also: 80% of US LNG is already going to Europe (and as discussed last week, is sold at high spot market “TTF” prices). The next major wave of US LNG liquefaction facilities is not coming online until 2025, and much of this capacity is already contracted as is usually the case since developers need such contracts to finance construction. In Europe, it will take time for completion of any new German LNG import facilities and to improve connectivity between Spain’s LNG import facilities and the rest of the continent
“
Accelerate wind and solar
”? European wind and solar MWh have been growing at just 1% per year since 2000; bottlenecks are often transmission and interconnection queues. Furthermore, electricity represents just 19% of European final energy consumption. In other words, Europe can decarbonize the grid more rapidly but the region would still be heavily reliant on thermal energy (oil, gas, coal) for industrial production of cement, glass, bricks, steel, ammonia, plastics; and for transportation and building heat
“
More heat pumps for residential heating
”? European electrification of residential heating is unchanged since 2013 at 25% of residential energy consumed. These are very slow-moving transitions; heat pump adoption is confined so far mostly to Scandinavia whose adoption rates are 9x the rest of Europe
“
Maximize nuclear power
”? Oh, the irony. In any case, European nuclear plants already operate at 80% capacity factors with much of the residual unavailable due to maintenance downtime (US levels are ~90%)
As shown below, Europe’s energy reliance on Russia is too high to reduce quickly. A decline in European energy costs is mostly dependent on (a) resolution of the Ukraine conflict, (b) the large 2.5x seasonal drop in gas demand in March/April and (c) an end to US/EU oil and gas buying for strategic reserve purposes.In any case, what is going on in China? As usual, that’s a question that has to be triangulated
I often read that China has a zero COVID tolerance policy but I’m not sure what to make of this. As shown below, China’s reported COVID mortality rate is just 2% of South Korea, Singapore and Japan levels. Once you strip out people that reportedly died in Hubei province,
the official COVID mortality rate in all of China outside Hubei is just 0.05% of its Asian neighbors
. It’s hard for epidemiologists to cross check by looking at “all-cause” excess deaths in China, since China is the reportedly only place in the world other than Greenland and the Spanish Sahara (the area between Morocco and Mauritania) that doesn’t report this data on a regular basis
1
.
Second, a lot of high frequency economic data in China is almost back to normal
. In other words, whatever COVID measures China has adopted, much of its economic activity is close to pre-COVID levels including electricity and coal consumption, steel output, road travel, rail travel and home sales. Only domestic air travel and movie theatre receipts show signs of much lower mobility.Of course, the other challenge regarding China analysis is that not that many people are allowed to go there right now. As a result, we have to rely on triangulated data to draw our conclusions.The next three charts show our China activity monitors separated into positive, stable and negative signs. The 5.5% GDP growth target just announced by China’s National People’s Congress will likely require some additional fiscal stimulus to meet (this GDP growth target is 1% lower than targets for 2019-2021). The third chart may not change anytime soon: the Chinese gov’t reiterated its stance that “housing is for living in, not speculation”.For equity investors: China has performed poorly in 2022 so far, in-line with the selloffs in other major regions this year in spite of stabilizing economic and profits data
. The primary reason: despite the war, markets still expect substantial Fed tightening this year (and so do we). While abstract rules can diverge from Fed decisions, the last chart below from JP Morgan Economic Research shows the rising pressure on the Fed to act in 2022

.Appendix: the Russian invasion of Ukraine, military balances and paths not takenOn our webcast last week we discussed 1,000 years of Russian totalitarianism and the window during the 1990’s when Russia was geopolitically weakened that coincided with NATO’s eastward expansion. Factors driving that brief period: Russia’s sovereign debt default, oil prices collapsing to $10 per barrel and the disintegration of Russia’s foreign exchange reserves, current account surplus and currency.
In the late 1990’s, Russians were already anxious for change back to the old ways, and NATO understood this risk very clearly
:
“…the inclination to the authoritarian forms of government is not limited by the ruling elite only. Diverse social groups are more and more actively revealing their interest in authoritarianism”
“the notion of enlightened, liberal, civilized and tame authoritarianism in Russia where there are such strong and deep historical traditions will hardly work…if society does not resist authoritarianism, the present authoritarian forms of government will acquire a much more brutal and despotic character”
“
Authoritarianism in Russia: Dangers for Democracy
”, A. Galkin/NATO Office of Information and Press, 1999
Around the same time, there were warnings against NATO expansion from George Kennan and from 50 US foreign policy experts, politicians and retired military officers who signed a letter entitled “
Opposition to NATO expansion
”. Signatories included Bill Bradley, Gary Hart, Sam Nunn, Paul Nitze (Secretary of the Navy), Stansfield Turner (Navy Admiral, commander of Second Fleet, Supreme Allied Commander NATO Southern Europe and CIA) and Robert McNamara (Secretary of Defense), who by then had realized the mistakes the US made during the Vietnam War.
Was there a path that might have prevented the destruction of Ukraine?
One might have been “Finlandization”, and the other might have been a path to NATO membership with explicit military protection along the way. Last November, the US and Ukraine signed a “Charter on Strategic Partnership” that asserted US support for Ukraine’s right to join NATO, but with no protections. Neither path was taken, and now 90 years after Stalin imposed the Holodomor terror-famine on Ukraine which killed 4 million people

, Russia is destroying Ukraine again. At this point, in addition to the bravery of its defenders, the only thing that might preserve an independent Ukraine is the “protection of divine Providence”, requested by Thomas Jefferson in the US Declaration of Independence in 1776.1

MR. MICHAEL CEMBALEST:  Good morning.  The bulk of this week’s note is on China, Russia’s invasion of the Ukraine, and the surge in natural gas, oil, coal, electricity, wheat, copper, palladium, and all the other prices which are going to drag Europe into recession and probably impose a heavy growth drag on the rest of the world, as well.
Before getting into all that, there’s a chart here that should hang in the office of policymakers everywhere.  Energy transitions are really slow moving, particularly when citizens of the countries adopting them erect NIMBY barriers along the way.  The chart shows just how quickly over the last 20 years smart phones, Ubers, broadband, internet access, social media, things like that skyrocket quickly.  Wind and solar share of global primary energy consumption is still 4% and EV shares of global vehicles owned are still around 1.5 to 2%.
The point is that countries that reduce their supply of thermal energy at a much faster pace than they reduce their demand for thermal energy are paying a very stiff price for that right now.  We expect some about-face movements on this in the days ahead, but as we’ve discussed often, capital spending by the 1,200 largest energy companies in the world has fallen 75% from peak levels while global demand for oil, gas, and coal is unchanged.
So, if you do not have a synchronous match between your decarbonization of demand and decarbonization of supply, you can experience what’s going on in Europe this morning which are unimaginable large increases in all sorts of energy-related prices.
Why are we writing about China this week?  Well, China’s connection to the war in Ukraine is important to watch because a lot of its financial and energy decisions may dilute the effectiveness of sanctions on Russia.  There’s a chart in here showing that Europe and China are the two large importers of energy in the world, while Russia, of course, is a large exporter.  The US is kind of in balance.
So far, Russia’s gas exports to Europe are roughly unchanged from where they were last year, so if Europe decided to reduce exposure to Russian gas, China could step in gradually over the next decade.  There are some projects in Siberia, in Sakhalin which could add almost half of what Russia currently sells and exports to Europe in terms of gas.
Russia has expanded its trade with China.  Russia is now China’s largest recipient of state-sector financing.  The countries began using their own currencies to settle bilateral trade.  China has created, it’s still in its infancy, but they’ve created a cross-border inter-bank payment system to compete with Swift, and they also abstained from condemning Russia at the U.N., although I’m not sure how much that actually matters.
The bottom line is that it’s very important to watch China here because we think that it’s going to do a variety of things that will dilute the effectiveness of sanctions on Russia, in which case the war could be prolonged.  Just as a reminder of how China’s geopolitical lens often differs from the West, over the last decade it has been North Korea’s almost sole trade counterparty.  We searched through all 40,000 possible bilateral trade combinations in the world and there’s none of them as high as the North Korean trade reliance on China.
Before getting into some of the China issues, we do comment in this week’s piece on the shock treatment plan advanced by the International Energy Agency to wean Europe off of Russian energy supplies; it’s very ambitious.  Ambitious is a synonym for probably not workable.  Diversifying gas suppliers, well, the next major wave of US LNG export facilities isn’t coming online until 2025.  A lot of that capacity is already contracted since you need to do that to finance construction.
Europe may agree to build and interconnect some new LNG import facilities; that takes a lot of time.  Accelerate wind and solar; well, wind and solar megawatt hours have been growing at 1% a year in Europe since the year 2000, and electricity also represents just 20% of overall energy consumption.  So, even if they decarbonize the grid more rapidly, Europe would still be heavily reliant on oil, gas, and coil for industrial production of cement, glass, brick, steel, ammonia, plastics, and for transportation and building heat.
We walk through some of the suggestions the EIA made as well.  The bottom line is that Europe’s energy reliance on Russia is way too high to reduce that quickly.  Any decline in energy prices is probably going to require some kind of resolution of the Ukraine conflict, and the large seasonal drop in gas demand that typically takes place in March, April, that’ll probably help the most.  Then an end to the US and Europe that are now buying oil and gas for strategic reserve purposes; that will run its course, as well.
As for what’s going on in China, that’s a question that has to be triangulated.  I often am told by colleagues and in research pieces that China has a zero tolerance policy for COVID.  I’m not sure exactly what to make of that.
First, I don’t find the COVID data, I’m not alone here, but I don’t find the COVID data reporting China to be in any way credible.  If you accept China’s officially reported data the COVID mortality rate would just be 2% of the levels reported in South Korea, Singapore, and Japan, and then if you stripped out the people that reportedly died in Hubei province, the official COVID mortality rate in China outside Hubei is 0.05% of its Asian neighbors.
I don’t find that credible, and it’s very hard for epidemiologists to cross-check by looking at something called all-cause deaths in China, because China is the only place in the world other than Greenland and the Spanish Sahara, which is the area between Morocco and Mauritania, that doesn’t report excess death information on a regular systematic basis.
Second, and probably more importantly, a lot of the high-frequency data in China is almost back to normal, so whatever COVID measures they’re adopting, a lot of its economic activity is pretty close to pre-COVID levels.  So, we have a chart in here that shows electricity, coal consumption, steel output, road travel, rail travel, and home sales.  The only things that are showing real COVID-related mobility reduction still are domestic air travel in China and movie theater receipts.  But for the most part, whatever this COVID policy is, it’s leaving room for plenty of activity in both goods and services.
When we look at our China activity monitor, the data looks pretty good outside of residential commercial construction.  Steel production, exports, industrial production, construction, corporate earnings, are all either rising or stable.  The Chinese government just announced the 5.5% growth target for this year.  They’ll need some additional fiscal stimulus to meet that, but so far the Chinese economy has been weathering the storm recently better than a lot of other places have.
Now, for equity investors, China has performed poorly so far, in line with the sell-offs and all the other major regions, in spite of the stable economical and profit data.  The primary reason for that is despite the war the markets are still expecting substantial fed tightening this year, and unfortunately, so do we.
While these abstract rules on what the fed policy rate should be sometimes diverge from fed decisions, right now all of those rules are pointing to the need for a funds rate that’s much higher than what it is now.  The markets are now pricing in six to seven hikes over the next year.  I think that’s about right; maybe it’s five at the minimum, seven at the maximum.  But we are going to see for the first time in a long time the federal reserve hiking rates in the middle of a war, and a spike in all sorts of commodity-related prices.
As a result, I don’t think we’ve seen the worst of the current war or stock market levels just yet.  It’s going to be very difficult to time the bottom, but it does seem like there are more difficult days ahead given the deleveraging and risk offloading that’s taking place.
Thank you to those of you that dialed into the webcast last week.  We had about 15,000 people participating globally.  We talked about a lot of the issues we already talked about today, but we started with a discussion of 1,000 years of Russian totalitarianism and that brief window during the 1990s when they were weakened geopolitically because of the collapse in oil prices, the debt default, and the disintegration of their currency in foreign exchange reserves.
Around that time there were plenty of warnings against NATO expansion and we discussed some of them on the call last week, and at the end of this week’s note we follow up with just a little more of an exploration of some of the paths that might have been taken to prevent the current destruction of Ukraine.  Nothing’s for sure, and nobody knows whether or not these things would have worked or not.
Here we are 90 years after Stalin imposed a terror famine on the Ukraine deliberately which killed several million people, and the Russians are destroying Ukraine again.  So, it’s very possible that there’s nothing that could have been done to prevent what’s currently happening in the Ukraine.  But at the end of this week’s note we do examine some of those paths and what they might have been.
So, I’ll be writing and speaking more frequently now as we go through all of this so that all of our clients are aware of our best and current thinking.  Thank you for listening.

MR. MICHAEL CEMBALEST:  Good morning and welcome to the 2020 Eye on the Market Outlook.  This is Michael Cembalest.  Hope everybody had a good holiday.  Our 2020 Outlook is entitled ""Ghosts of Christmas Past,"" and if you look at the cover, you'll see some of these ghosts, some of whom have returned from the past based on their connection to certain themes that we're looking at in 2020.  So you'll see FDR, Nixon, Thatcher, Hoover, Mao, the Pets.com sock puppet and some other familiar historical figures on the cover and we're going to walk through what all those connections are to our 2020 view.
Here's the summary: after a really positive year for investors last year, we expect lower positive returns this year.  We don't expect a global or US recession and we think that there's going to be a modest growth and profits rebound now that some of the worst case trade outcomes look like they're going to be avoided.
Even so, high valuations in equity markets, the reduced effectiveness of monetary easing, the repricing of unprofitable companies which is a process that's been underway for a few months, and rising corporate cost pressures will probably constrain the equity market advance.
And what we're monitoring in terms of the two big risks that could cause problems for investors-one would be a spike in inflation that forces the Fed to make a U-turn on policy rates, which we don't think is likely but is in the realm of the possible.  And the second big risk, of course, is a comprehensive progressive restructuring of the US economy after the 2020 election.
The Outlook itself is composed of an executive summary of a few pages and then ten special topics based on questions that our clients have been asking us.  Here's an overview of some of the things you can expect to see in the Outlook: we look at how the trade war basically knocked back global manufacturing earnings and capital spending from their 2018 peaks to be roughly flat on a year on year basis by the end of 2019.
So what's interesting about the US-China trade war is actually that Europe and Japan bore the harsher brunt of it, given their larger reliance on exports and their precarious growth trends in the first place.  And while there wasn't a GDP growth recession last year, there certainly was an earnings recession in the US, Europe and Japan, meaning two consecutive quarters of negative growth.  We do expect earnings to rebound in 2020 but that's priced into most equity markets.
One of the reasons why we're optimistic about a growth and profits rebound next year is a surge in coordinated central bank easing which normally leads to a manufacturing boost seven to nine months later, and that includes emerging markets central banks which are now cutting rates since emerging markets inflation is at an all-time low--about 3.5% to 4%, which is an unrecognizably low number for those of us that worked in emerging markets in the 1980s and 1990s.
Some of the evidence that there's an impact from all this easing is a rise in global new orders, now that the inventory overhang has been worked off, and a rebound in global semiconductor sales.
Now, to be clear, even after a US-China phase one deal, there are significant trade and investment barriers that remain.  The US Department of Commerce is working on its entity restriction list and product export rules to limit exports of emerging and foundational technologies, and so while US-China trade flows may normalize, bilateral foreign direct investment will probably not.
The Chinese are ramping up security regulations on hardware, software and data.  They have a new cryptography law which bans virtual private networks and requires all email and data transfer to be visible to China's cyber security bureau.  The US Senate is investigating the China Thousand Talents plan where it's been accessing US information and intellectual property via Chinese researchers studying in the US and funded by US taxpayers-so there's still a lot to go in the China trade war.
I think the worst case outcomes have been avoided, but I think we're in for kind of a low level conflict for a period of years.  And remember, Trump may still impose penalties on $110 billion of US auto parts and auto imports from Europe and Japan.  The US is pursuing section 301 investigations against France and probably now Italy for their digital taxes on US technology imports, and there may be European retaliation for US tariffs on European goods as a function of the whole Airbus thing. So the worst case outcomes in the trade war have been avoided, but there are still quite a few conflict issues left.
The foundation of our optimism for 2020, however, particularly in the US, is based on the strength of the US consumer.  US consumption is close to its highest share of overall global GDP since 2008-in other words, just the output and the activity and the demand coming from US consumers is at its highest level relative to all activity going on in the world since 2008, and US consumers are still pretty optimistic.
Service sectors that make up a large share of the economy are doing much better than manufacturing, and most measures of wages, labor markets, household debt, consumer delinquencies and housing look pretty good.  That said, it's pretty clear from the data why Trump was trying to find a way out of this trade war.
US manufacturing employment growth has weakened sharply since the trade war started and now the service sectors that are most exposed to manufacturing are seeing employment growth slow as well.  And when you look at falling trucking employment on a year on year basis now and you're looking at a pretty large spike in foreign loan delinquency rates and bankruptcies, it's pretty clear why the President was trying to find a way out of this trade war.
From a valuation perspective, valuations are high.  They have been for a while and that certainly didn't prevent great returns in 2019.  The difference was from 2009 to 2018, the market advance in the US was mostly a function of earnings growth, whereas last year, it was almost exclusively or entirely a function of multiple expansion.  So another year of multiple expansion doesn't seem that likely to me-earnings growth will probably have to be the primary driver of whatever market advances we get.
And we're also starting to see cracks in risky and poorly underwritten investments, whether that has to do with the energy sector, technology IPOs that aren't really technology IPOs-there's been a spike in weakest link companies that have very low ratings.
And then one of the things that we do in detail in this piece is we take a look at what we call the YUCs, which is-it's an acronym and it stands for Young Unprofitable Companies that have negative net income but rapid sales growth and have been around for less than five years.
And we go into some detail here showing that since we're at the highest level of these YUCs as a percentage of both market cap and corporate spending since the year 2000.  And if investors tire of financing these YUCs, which I think is part of what's happening is you're seeing in the IPO markets the consequences for growth and large cap tech profits could be material.
That said, the very slow pace of net US equity supply should mitigate any downside in the next sell off, whether it takes place with or without a US recession.  And as a reminder, we had a 20% sell off in December 2018, followed by the fastest bear market recovery on record over the next 100 days.  So we live in a world where you can always have a sharp drawdown, but in our view, the supply-demand dynamics of the US equity markets right now suggest that any corrections like that would be rapidly recovered rather than the much longer drawdowns that took place in the past.
And the big risk for 2020-obviously we discussed earlier, one is a pickup in US wage or price inflation that makes it clear that the Fed has made a mistake in cutting rates to zero again.
And the new thinking from the Fed about policy rates estimates that the natural real rate of interest-in other words, the policy rate in excess of inflation-doesn't have to be 2% to 3% the way that it used to be.  It can be less than 1%, and right now it's almost zero.  So any unexpected resurgence in inflation could cause real problems in terms of indicating that the Fed's off-side.  I think that's less likely.
The other thing that we're more focused on is a progressive overhaul of the US economy after the election, which we go into detail about in this piece.  But let me just summarize it as follows: in the Great Depression, US unemployment reached 22%, and FDR raised annual federal tax receipts by somewhere between 3.5% to 4% of GDP.
Elizabeth Warren's proposals, as an example, increases taxes two and a half times the FDR tax increases to fund this progressive restructuring of the economy and I think there could be a variety of unanticipated consequences for investors, particularly given proposed bans and restrictions on stock buybacks, increased corporate tax rates, sector level collective bargaining, and a bunch of other things like that.
And you know, the history suggests that Trump should be reelected on paper, right?  So a lot of you have seen our chart before--since 1896, no president has lost with strong economic tailwinds, with the exception of Taft, and that was back in 1912.  All of the other incumbent presidents that lost did so at a time where the market and economic scores were below 0.5, and we have a chart in here that shows that.
And we have these scores that go back to 1896 that incorporate things like inflation and employment and unemployment, changes in employment, per capita GDP, equity markets, home prices, and on paper it looks like Trump should be reelected quite easily.  He's got the strongest tailwinds for an incumbent over the last 120 years.
Now, the counterpoint to that is that a lot of those tailwinds were in place in the midterm elections and the GOP lost a very large number of seats at a time of strong market economic conditions.  Based on some rough math, I would have expected them to lose somewhere between 8 to 12 seats and they ended up losing 40.  So there are obviously other factors driving the electorate right now other than pure market and economic data.
So to sum up, we think next year looks like a year of a global recovery in profits and in economic growth.  Valuations are pricing most of that in already, and there are a couple of exogenous risks, one of which is related to an inflation surge in the US which I think is unlikely, and the other one is a progressive restructuring of the economy after the election which is too close to call right now.
In the remainder of the Outlook, we answer ten questions we've been receiving from clients as we head into 2020.  The questions include things like: Why don't I think there will be a recession in the US next year?  What are the greatest risks to investors in credit markets when the next recession does happen?  Why do US equity markets keep outperforming Europe and Japan year after year after year?  By the way, we expect them to again in 2020. How is China doing at a time of trade conflict, and what are the implications for emerging market investors?  Why is US inflation dead?  What are negative interest rates doing to European banks?  Will value stocks ever stop underperforming growth?  They actually did for a couple of months last year.  What are the greatest risks to markets from a possible progressive overhaul of the economy?  What's going on in US IPO markets?  And a final section on the most interesting breakthrough that I learned about in 2019.
With respect to the progressive overhaul, we go into quite a bit of detail on the progressive agenda as it relates to taxation, corporate profits, labor markets, healthcare, energy, student debt, trade, as well as energy, technology.
And then a couple of comments on these new Pillar One proposals in the OECD where they intend to tax digital services where they're consumed rather than where they're created, and so I think those are very important trends to focus on, particularly since the tech sector-which has really been driving the markets in terms of earnings growth and multiple expansion-are the ones that benefit from almost the lowest effective tax rates by sector, and have the highest foreign revenue exposure by sector.  So a change in US or foreign tech policy would have a pretty big impact on the tech sector.
In any case, take a look--the Outlook is available as of right now on the internet, and you can read the whole thing or you can read individual sections of it, and I look forward to seeing many of you in my travels early in the new year.

Equity markets are still stuck in the Trumpism range we outlined in our last piece as evidence mounts that the trade war is having an adverse impact. Given these rising uncertainties and Senator Warren’s rise in the polls, we take a broad look at Progressive policy proposals on taxation, energy, labor, investment, healthcare and anti-trust, including a deep dive into proposals to tax unrealized capital gains on an annual basis. As anti-trust momentum builds, we also take a look at recent tech IPOs. The underperformers are often “tangential tech”: transactional marketplace companies with substantial third party ecosystem costs, and a subcontracted work/sales force. Most pure technology IPOs with scalable B2B offerings continue to perform well. Read more

Companies are divided into pure tech (software as a service model, usually B2B and cloud based, delivered at close to zero marginal cost with increased returns to scale); marketplace companies (transactional sales model, often reliant on sub-contracted sales or workforce and substantial ecosystem third party costs); hardware (upfront sales of equipment with little to no follow on revenue); hardware/software blend (upfront hardware sale and software subscription); and social media. The chart shows that real technology companies are doing fine while “tangential technology” companies are struggling.Scatter plot showing the year of different US presidential administrations along the Y axis, and UCLA Voteview Liberal-Conservative scores along the X axis. Liberal-Conservative scores are based on the voting records of presidents and their administration members during their terms in congress. The liberal-conservative scores range from 1 to -1, with 1 being extremely conservative, -1 being extremely liberal, and 0 being centrist. The chart shows that since 1916, presidents and their administrations have become either increasingly liberal or conservative, and have strayed further from a score of 0. Elizabeth Warren is also plotted on the chart, and she currently holds the most liberal score, around -.75. Trump’s administration, by contrast, has the most conservative score on the chart, at around .55.[START RECORDING]

MICHAEL CEMBALEST:
Good morning everybody. This is the October Eye on the market podcast. We have 3 topics this week that we’ve written about. The first is a quick discussion of U.S. tech IPO performance. The second takes a look at what’s happening with the trade war in China as it wears out its welcome in DC. And then the third is a special Eye on the market section on the full contour of progressive democratic policy proposals given the rise of Senator Warren in the polls. First on, on the tech IPO situation, there’s been a lot of headlines recently on struggles of certain technology companies in the IPO market and in the pre IPO market. And those, those headlines are justifiable for the situations they’re describing. What I think got lost in the shuffle here is that most technology IPOs are doing just fine. And what are struggling are tangential tech companies that are included in the broad tech category but which are not really technology. If you look at them more closely. So we have a chart here that looks at all the different technology IPO’s in 2018 and 19. And what you see is that the companies that deliver software as a service model, usually on a B to B basis and cloud-based, deliver their products at close to 0 marginal cost and have sharply increasing returns to scale and most of those IPOs are doing quite well. The marketplace companies which have a transactional sales model and a lot of usually substantial ecosystem third party costs, subcontracted sales forces, subcontracted workforces. Those are the companies that are, that are struggling a little bit. So take a look at the chart. I think it speaks for itself, but I think the headlines recently have obscured a little bit of what’s going on in the underlying tech IPO market which is pretty good performance of real software technology companies. Then on, after Labor Day we wrote an Eye on the market on the trade war and Trumpism. And our conclusion is that we think equity markets are range bound by what the president is doing and that the upper end of that range is around 3000 on the S & P. So the latest news I think confirms that because, A, we’re starting to see even more policy proposals that are negative for global trade and, B, we’re actually starting to see actual economic data confirm the impact of the trade war on some global manufacturing data. So, on the policy front, the latest thing that’s happened, that I don’t know if it’ll actually get enacted, but it’s just a sign of the times, Senator Rubio proposed delisting Chinese companies that don’t comply with US accounting regs. And of course in 2013, the Chinese had signed that agreement allowing U.S. regulators to get audit working papers from Chinese companies and that, of course, never got enacted. And Rubio also proposed banning any federal retirement account from investing in portfolios that have benchmarks with Chinese exposure. So, the conclusion on this front is that the most important chart that we may have in here on the trade is the one showing that with 2 decades since China joined the World Trade Organization, it’s still the most mercantile country in the world. And at this point, they have very few friends left in Washington on either side of the aisle to defend them. And they’ve got a lot of detractors in the private sector as well. So the best outcome I can imagine for now is a narrow deal sometime early next year, mostly based on agriculture given all the problems that China is having in its agricultural sector. And by the way, in another blow to global trade, the WTO has now authorized the U.S. to put tariffs on a small amount, about 8 billion, of European goods to compensate the U.S. for unfair EU subsidies to Airbus. So, again, it’s a small number but there’s always the risk that there could be some retaliation by the EU. On the hard data side, we’re seeing a weakness in CEO confidence manufacturing surveys around the world, but we’re seeing a lot more strength in the U.S. consumer and the US service sector. And so that’s a dichotomy that I don’t think can last forever. And I think Trump’s playing with fire here’ cause we actually started seeing both in the U.S. and Germany for the first time in the cycle. Some weakness in manufacturing capital spending is now flowing through into the service sector. So I, I still don’t expect a recession in the United States in 2020. But there are increasing signs that this trade war is hurting not just the manufacturing sector, but maybe starting to bleed into services as well. We’ll see. As for China, one of the growth trackers that we look at, that looks at electricity production, and exports, and highway traffic, was running at about 7% growth in just a year and a half ago and is now down to 4%. So, this trade war is hurting China as well. So as it relates to the special section in the Eye on the market this month we were going to call it the Warren commission, but we decided on Warren Peace. President, Senator Warren has risen both in the polls and also in betting odds markets. Warren has almost a 50 % share in an aggregation of betting markets compared to 20 % for Biden and 10 % percent for Sanders. So, I thought it was a good idea to review the broad range of democratic progressive policy proposals that have been advanced by Senator Warren and others which she might adopt along the way. So there is a whole bunch of charts and tables in here that look through those policies, including a deep dive we’ve done on the proposal to tax unrealized capital gains each year. But one thing is clear, and this is a chart we at first included last December for the first time. If you look at the history of congressional voting records, since the very, since the beginning of the 20th century and you can go all the way back to the first Congress in the 1780s. And we looked at it over the last, let’s say 120 years. Senator Warren occupies a place on this empirically derived chart that is considerably to the left of any democratic president and also to the left of Democrats that aspired to become president as well, including people like Walter Mondell, McGovern and Humphrey. Anyway, take a look at this chart, take a look at the table. It walks through progressive policy proposals on taxation, the corporate sector, labor market, student debt, energy, healthcare, anti-trust, et cetera. And so we put a lot of effort in trying to capture the broad contours of these things. It was a really interesting discussion on how the federal government might tax unrealized capital gains each year, how they would deal with non-tradable assets like residential commercial real estate. We discussed as well the potential impact of a day 1 federal ban on hydraulic fracturing, which has to be put into the context of the fact that the U.S. now gets 60 to 80% of all its oil and natural gas and natural gas liquids from hydraulic fracturing processes and that they collectively account for around 40% of total U.S. primary energy consumption. So anybody proposing a ban on hydraulic fracturing, would probably need to have a pretty robust plan of what would they would do on day 2. We take a look at antitrust in the tech sector, specifically. There has been a really, up until about a year ago, the rate of FTC and Department of Justice antitrust enforcement on the tech sector was much lower than all other sectors and there is a lot of signs that that may be changing. And so that’s something that we need to understand. And then lastly, we take a look, a closer look at the prospects of a repeal in the U.S. corporate tax rates and additional windfall taxes on the corporate sector and the impact that that could have on the equity markets and corporate inversions. So, obviously we’ll be tracking more of this in the years ahead. I saw one thing that was an interesting reminder about how to be cautious with early polls. I think in 2003, the leader in the Democratic polls at this point in the process was Wesley Clark. In 2008, the leaders in the leader in the Republican Party was Giuliani and leader in the Democratic Party was Hillary Clinton. And then in 2011, the leader in the polls in the Republican Party was Rick Perry. So, we’re early in the process. But somehow I think the dynamic is a little bit different this time and it’s time to take a close look at the Senator Warren’s proposals, which is what we do in this week’s notes. So, thank you for listening and we will talk to you again next time.

MR. MICHAEL CEMBALEST:
Greetings, everybody.  This is Michael Cembalest with the February Eye on the Market podcast, in which I'm going to answer some of the questions we've been getting on the Coronavirus, US equity market concentrations in the mega cap stocks, which have been soaring, the Democratic healthcare plans after the Iowa caucuses, and just a couple of brief comments on student loans.
So a few weeks ago, as everybody knows, scientists who studied the transmission of animal-borne illnesses to humans were ringing alarm bells about the Coronavirus, based on the infection rates, flight bookings, train bookings, car trips, and all sorts of estimates of disease parameters on transmission mortality.  And in mid to late January, the team of scientists that I've been tracking at York University in Toronto had an estimate as high as 163,000 infections in Wuhan alone and a mean reproductive number of 6.5, which is very high compared to SARS, MERS, and swine flus and things.
But at the time, they also modeled what would happen if there were very aggressive policies on quarantine of infected individuals and suspected infections and contact-reducing policies in terms of how that affected both infected and asymptomatic individuals, which they thought could sharply reduce the infection rates.  And that seems like exactly what's happened.  Their projection from yesterday is down from 163,000 in Wuhan to about a total projected cumulative cases closer to 20,000 to 25,000, out of a population in Wuhan of 11 million.  And they expect a peak daily infection rate to occur in Wuhan within a week.
Now infection rates in other large Chinese cities are probably one to two weeks behind Wuhan.  So by the time this is done, we're probably looking, we could be looking at 150,000 to 300,000 infections in China, and with the range affected by travel bands and contact rates and things like that.  And so obviously a huge hit to Chinese growth and economic activity in the first quarter, but not the global pandemic that it looked like it was in mid-January.  And obviously we'll have to see what happens; we'll continue to track this.  But it does seem as if the policies that a lot of these virus scientists were recommending that China pursue in mid-January they finally have adopted, which should contribute to at least a slower acceleration and probably a peak infection rate in late February or early March throughout all of China.
Now growth tends to rebound one or two quarters after these outbreaks.  That's the good news.  The bad news is compared to SARS and other periods in the past, China is gargantuan now compared to what it was then, many multiples higher in terms of passenger car sales, the weight in the emerging markets, equity markets, smartphone sales, computer sales, air travel, crude oil consumption, international tourism.  So China is three, four, five, ten times what it was in 2002.
So I think it's going to be difficult to pinpoint exactly what the economic impact is going to be in China and the world.  It makes sense to sharply mark those down for Q1, but if a global pandemic is avoided and right now that's what it looks like, one would expect a growth rebound to take place in Q2 and parts of Q3, and for the world to regain the trend growth that existed in late December and early January, which was a world that was improving, but slowly.
The second topic that we discussed in this week's Eye on the Market has to do with the remarkable concentration of US equity markets in a few mega cap stocks, the ones you're familiar with, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Visa, and how these firms now contribute more to returns and to overall market cap than they have since the year 2000.  And so this kind of concentration in market valuations and returns requires us to have a view on their valuations, particularly after the run that we've just seen over the last few months.  And we've got a whole table of statistics in here.
The bottom line is that investors are paying a premium of about 1.4 times the market for these stocks, based on their higher sales growth and margins, versus the market.  That premium, believe it or not, is up from parity in 2010.  That's how cheap they used to be and is at its highest level since then.  But this 1.4 times premium is more or less the premium that existed for several years before the financial crisis, and this premium peaked at 1.8 to 2 in the late nineties.  Now nobody should ever invest solely based on comparisons to the most mispriced period in history.  So I guess the way we would summarize this is the opportunity to buy these mega cap stocks at valuations similar to the markets gone, but the premium hasn't reached absurd levels yet.
The challenge is now we've had this rally since Labor Day.  We're monitoring four big headwinds.  There's antitrust and DOJ investigations on at least half of these companies.  There's digital service taxes in France and other European countries.  There's a lot of overlapping hedge fund ownership.  And then lastly and the one that we explored in the outlook, all these big mega caps are very sensitive to changes in spending by these young unprofitable companies, the fast-growing public and private companies, which we call the YUCs that we talked about in the outlook.  And the market seems to be taking a much closer focus on these YUCs and closer focus meaning less appetite to finance them.  So I think the sweet spot opportunities for these mega caps has probably passed, and at this point, I would expect a fair bit of volatility at least over the next 12 months as we sort out all the issues around antitrust, digital service taxes, and things like that.
Okay, so in the wake of the Iowa caucus, I wanted to spend time in the Eye on the Market this week on the Democratic healthcare plans.  And to do that, I'm going to rely on a really detailed and fascinating analysis from the Committee for Responsible Federal Budget, which a lot of you will know about is made up of politicians from both sides of the aisle that are retired and now can speak freely about all sorts of fiscal issues like healthcare.
And here's the bottom line.  There are some charts in here that show this, but under all of the plans, and when I say all, I'm talking about Biden, Buttigieg, Warren, and Sanders, so those are the four plans we looked at, under all four plans, tens of millions of uninsured Americans would obtain healthcare coverage.  Now in the case of Sanders and Warren, this would be financed with trillions of dollars in new budget deficits even after trillions in taxes and worker and employer contributions.  Biden and Buttigieg's plans achieve around half the decline in the uninsured population, but at a fraction of the cost, and fraction meaning less than 10% in terms of measured in new deficits and new taxes.  And in the wake of the Iowa caucus, I think this is going to be an issue that people are going to want to keep tracking.
And so we go into all the grisly details here.  These estimates are hard to do.  You've got to estimate prescription drug savings.  You've got to incorporate whatever caps people have on healthcare costs growth.  You've got to look at increased taxes on personal and corporate income and contributions, non-healthcare spending cuts.  And you even have to look at this thing called a revenue feedback effect, which is if all of a sudden, companies and individuals are no longer subject to employer-provided healthcare costs that are deducted from their paychecks, their pre-tax income goes up, and therefore has a positive revenue feedback.  So there's a lot of stuff that goes into making these forecasts, but after all the years of reading everything I've seen from the CBO and the OMB, nobody does this better than the Committee for Responsible Federal Budget.
So the bottom line again is that the Warren and Sanders plans are estimated to add somewhere between 6 and $13 trillion to the ten-year budget deficit, even after the imposition of trillions in income, capital gains, payroll, wealth, and estate taxes.  So that's something that needs to be looked at pretty closely.  We also get, and by the way, the Sanders plan on its own would double the current estimate of the deficit.  We also get, I don't want to go into too much detail, but we discuss how quickly a new Democratic administration and Senate majority, if we get one, could reverse the corporate tax cuts.
The bottom line is difficult to do under regular rules.  They could rely on reconciliation rules that only require a simple majority.  They wouldn't be able to make any changes after the ten-year budget window.  And presumably they would just raise corporate and personal taxes and increase spending by an equal amount, so it doesn't change the budget window.  The thing that's more interesting to me is how easy it would be for Democrats to raise payroll taxes and subject all earned and unearned income to taxation above a certain level, like 250,000.  And that gets into the whole question of the filibuster.  If Democrats get rid of the filibuster, practically anything could be passed by a simple majority, and Harry Reid, who is the former Senate majority leader, and other progressives are now arguing that the filibuster should be scrapped for that specific purpose, to ensure passage of a progressive agenda, if they end up controlling all three branches of government.
So that's essentially what we all have to watch as these things play out, is how likely is it that a Democratic, unified government, if one would happen, would decide to abandon the filibuster.  Some people, including some people I talk to in our own government relations group, believe that the moderate Senate and the House Democrats might be reluctant to support all of the big tax increases associated with some parts of the progressive agenda.  But I'm not so sure.  Unified governments sometimes push people to vote for legislation if they think it's their only window in a generation to get something done.  In any case, take a close look at the Eye on the Market today, 'cause we walk through the Congressional and legislative logistics behind what it would take to make those changes to payroll taxes and corporate taxes.
The last topic for today is last fall, Jamie asked me whether I had ever done any work on student loans.  And I said not really.  And he said, ""Well good, so now you can do that.""  And so I spent a few weeks pulling together for him a deep dive report on student loans, including an assessment of what went wrong and what could be done next.  I've summarized the 20-page piece in this week's Eye on the Market on just a couple of pages.  And some of the conclusions might surprise you.  According to a comprehensive and really ground-breaking study from Brookings Institute, the primary problem is not one of high and rising costs, in terms of the problems with the system.  Once you take institutional aid and federal grants into account, net college costs are 30 to 45% lower than the gross stated costs.
The bigger issue is where students have been studying.  The policy changes which allowed that shift to take place and the labor market outcomes, in the year 2000, the top ten schools that made up most student debt were for the most part pretty selective four-year colleges, Penn State, Ohio State, NYU, Temple, University of Minnesota.  By 2014, the top ten list, DeVry, Walden University, Strayer, Kaplan, Argosy, Ashford, all of these for-profit schools instead.  And these for-profit schools also tend to have much higher degrees of reliance on federal student loans.
So you might say to yourself well what's the problem with for-profit colleges?  Let me tell you.  They have much lower graduation rates.  Their students face much higher rates of unemployment, and much lower median earnings than the entire rest of the system.  And therefore they default on the loans at much higher rates.  And this is known inside the student loan community, 'cause there was also a spike in the for-profit share of student loans in the late 1980s that led to a spike in defaults almost immediately.  And just to put some numbers on it, graduation rates for public and nonprofit regular schools, anywhere from 50 to 70%.  For-profit schools, 20 to 30%.  Median earnings for selective four-year colleges are double what they are for the for-profit colleges.  Unemployment rate, 20% versus 6% for the regular selective universities.
And finally what this all boils down to is you read so many things in the press about default rates around 10%.  What's really going on with that number?  The default rates are much closer to 5 or 6% for regular selective and somewhat selective colleges and 25 to 30 to 35% default rates for the for-profit colleges and the certificate-based two-year colleges.
So instead of blowing up the entire system and redesigning it from scratch and spending almost $1 trillion writing off all student debt, I think it makes sense to preserve the part of the system that's working now for borrowers.  And there's a lot of stuff that we discuss in here, like designing a system where student loan repayments are linked to post-graduation income and not automatically fully amortizing, amounts get automatically withheld from each paycheck, you can introduce risk-based underwriting based not on the individual, but on the school.  There's a lot of things like that that can be done.  But to spend somewhere between 1 to $1.5 trillion writing off all student debt, and making tuition free at public universities appears to collide with other competing priorities in infrastructure, healthcare, and renewable energy.  So I think it makes sense to preserve the part of the system that's working and address at a much lower cost the part of the system that isn't.
So that's the story.  You can read about all these topics with links to all of the things you want to look into in detail.  Thanks very much for listening, and we'll talk to you again in March.  My plan is that the next Eye on the Market will be our annual energy paper where we're going to touch on among other things, what's going to happen to US energy independence.  Thank you, bye.

“What has so often excited wonder, is the great rapidity with which countries recover from a state of devastation, the disappearance in a short time, of all traces of mischief done by earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, and the ravages of war. An enemy lays waste a country by fire and sword, and destroys or carries away nearly all the moveable wealth existing in it: all the inhabitants are ruined, and yet in a few years after, everything is much as it was before.”

[Music playing]
MR. MICHAEL CEMBALEST:
Good morning.  This is the early-March Eye on the Market podcast.  This is Michael Cembalest.  What I’m going to do today is give you a brief update of all of the topics we’ve been covering in both the Eye on the Market and in the webcasts we’ve been holding for clients, where you get to dial in, and I spoke for about an hour and presented information you could see on the webcast in charts.
So let me get started.  Well, as we wrote in the outlook, we felt this was going to be a year of a very small, modest recovery in profits and economic growth, but valuations weren’t really set up for any kind of a shock.  We didn’t think we’d see an inflation shock, we didn’t see, think we’d see any further trade shocks.  We thought we might see a political shock in the U.S., but what we did not anticipate was a global virus shock of this magnitude.
Right now, the supply chains around the world are pretty stressed out, worse than they were right after Fukushima.  You’ve probably seen everywhere the data, showing that the infection rates in China have crested and are falling throughout China with the exception of inside Hubei itself, which is the epicenter.
Two things.  One, there are questions about the validity of that data, which I understand, and, second, even if that’s true, that has come at an incredible economic cost, the likes of which I can’t remember ever having seen anywhere.  If you look at coal consumption, railway traffic, home sales, transportation hubs, box office revenues, restaurant receipts, and things like that, they’re all down anywhere from 20% to 50% to 60% versus normal levels.  So the kind of lockdown that China has imposed upon itself is going to be enormously painful for China and reverberating throughout the rest of Asia, even if it is, does turn out just to be for a quarter or so.
And now, as you all know, the infection rates are rising outside China, where, historically, there are not too many instances of quarantines, contact tracing, and things like that, which I’ll touch on a little bit later.  But the bottom line is that if you look at the slope of the infection rate outside China, it’s a little bit slower, but similar enough to the acceleration in terms of the infection rate within Mainland China, just lagged by about a month.
The important thing to keep in mind here is to slow these outbreaks—and I’ve spent more time talking with virus scientists than I ever thought I would, including reading articles in something called the Journal of Hospital Infection, which, believe me, is not a fun read.  You can aggressively isolate infected individuals, but unless you also trace their contacts that they had before getting sick and isolate those people as well, you probably won’t be able to effectively control an outbreak.
And we have a chart here in, that we’ve had in the Eye on the Market and also in the webcast deck, that shows you different scenarios in terms of how many outbreaks you can control based on reproductive numbers and percentage of contacts traced and isolated.  And the speed with which this particular virus travels makes that kind of exercise even more difficult.  So there are real questions about the ability of western societies to engage in the kind of contact tracing and economic shutdown that we’ve seen in China.
You probably are well aware now that the vast majority, in terms of the concentration of mortality rates, are people over the age of 70 and/or people with severe preexisting conditions.  That’s well known.  The other thing I think, we’ll see,  but China is uniquely bad amongst all the countries in the world in one way, which is it has the highest combination of bad air quality and high cigarette-smoking rates.  So the mortality rates globally are about 3.5%, obviously, very heavily weighted by China.  I have reasons to believe that that number may be substantially lower outside China for reasons related to not just healthcare system quality, but also lower levels of smoking and better air quality, which means that most other populations are not nearly, don’t nearly have as much compromised lung capacity amongst the elderly population.
I will say this.  This whole episode has raised questions about the right risk premium for investing in China, particularly as MSCI and Barclays think about making huge additions of China to global benchmarks.  And there are some articles that we cited here.  One of them was called, “Coronavirus and the Blindness of Authoritarians,” in the Atlantic Monthly, that’s definitely worth a read, “How China’s Incompetence Endangered the World,” Foreign Policy magazine.  You get the point.  I think there are some real questions here on a long-run secular basis about the risk premium that you’d pay for Chinese assets given what we’ve now learned about this episode.
We’ve got a whole bunch of data in here that’s pretty straightforward on why the economic reverberations would be greatest inside China, and then, secondarily, in Asia, much less in Europe and the U.S.  But that’s looking at the shock from the perspective of its impact, of the China shock, on the rest of the world.
We’re now grappling with the fact that we may have a virus shock within Europe and within the United States.  And over the last 48 hours, I’ve been involved in discussions with our own company and other companies in terms of travel restrictions and all sorts of other things that will have cascading effects on both services and manufacturing.
I think, at this point, there’s a few things to keep in mind.  First, the history of pandemics, whether it was the original SARS virus, the swine flu, bird flus, Eboli, MERS, you have an economically, and with respect to equity markets, you have a drawdown in a certain quarter.  And then within one or two quarters, you start getting a payback to above trend growth.  And by the time you’re six months out, growth and equity markets are kind of right back where they started from and growing at whatever trend they were growing before the pandemic hit.  So that’s the pattern.
I think that pattern will be maintained this time.  I don’t think there’s going to be a lasting output shock on the world from this, but I do think that the depth of the shock and the length of the shock may be much longer than things that we’ve seen in the past because of the impact on so many different sectors in so many parts of the world.  I don’t think we’re dealing with anything that will have lasting effects in 2021 and 2022 and beyond, but there’s going to be a fairly big shock in 2020 to both growth and earnings.
One of the more important charts that we put in here was how should we measure what’s being priced into equity markets?  And one of the charts we have looks at that.  To us, it looks like this year’s earnings, based on the market decline so far, are expected to decline about 50% in both the U.S. and Japan and Europe.  And that seems like a pretty big number if you assume that the shock is all felt in this calendar year.
There are some other silver linings here, which is that the manufacturing sector and the wholesale inventory, and the wholesaling sector had inventory ratios well above normal heading into this, so they’ve got a buffer in terms of their supply chains.  In contrast, both retail and computer, electronics, more broadly, have very low levels of inventory compared to the past relative to sales.  And so it’s a little bit of a mixed bag, but at least parts of the U.S. economy have some cushion against a decline in intermediate goods imports.
And the other thing we look at—and, I think, most of our clients were surprised about this when I’ve shown it to them—is that if you look at reliance on China by industry and you look at intermediate goods imports from China as a percentage of all the intermediate goods that you use both domestic and imported, only electronics, that number’s about 20%.  The rest of the sectors are 5% to 10%.  So, in other words, 5% to 10% of inputs, intermediate goods inputs, by sector come from China; the rest either come from some other import counterparty or are produced domestically.
And so there are times when I think people overestimate the impact of a Chinese supply chain shock on the United States.  Obviously, for certain companies it’s bigger than others.  But this level of China dependence on inventory levels may act as something as a buffer for the next couple of months.
From a scientific perspective, I’ve been doing some interesting reading on the impact of changing seasons on virus transmission rates.  So, for example, the SARS virus in 2003, when temperature rates went up, the infection rates went down.  Now, there are a lot of other changes taking place from March to May in 2003.  They were improving healthcare delivery, they were changing hospitalization rates, they were giving doctors better medical equipment and more disinfected gowns, and so a lot of things were happening.  But there’s a lot of science that shows, there’s a lot of research that shows that viruses like the flu and SARS slow, the infection rates drop really sharply as temperatures go up, as humidity goes up, and as you have higher levels of solar radiation.
And one way of thinking about that is that in colder weather, a lot of these disease particles can travel longer distances and survive for longer periods of time than they do when you have warmer, more humid conditions.  And with respect to solar radiation, UV radiation is very well known to kill all sorts of surface viruses and bacteria.  As a matter of fact, one of the more interesting businesses I’ve seen are companies that make these UV radiation robots that travel around high school gyms and hospitals at night when the rooms are empty and sterilize everything.
So I do believe that, at least as we head from the end of winter into the spring and the summer, there should be an organic decline in the rate of infection, at least in the northern hemisphere.  The problem is in the southern part of the southern hemisphere, you’re heading into their winter in June, July, August, and it’s possible that the infection rates pick up there.
And one last thing on potential impacts.  There’s an enormous difference in the global financial system, and in particularly, the U.S. from 2007.  And some of the charts we have in here show much higher capital ratios, higher liquid assets as a percentage of short-term liabilities, much less repo usage by financial intermediaries.
In the United States, banks have way more retail deposits than they have loans.  So they have more than 100% coverage of their loan book with sticky deposits.  That’s very different from where the U.S. and Europe were in 2007, where there was a whole lot more wholesale banking that was at risk of having a run.  There’s been also a sharp decline in the risk in money market funds based on money market reform.  And so there’s been improved underwriting in securitization, for instance, commercial mortgage-backed securities.
And so, to me, the risks in the financial system, in terms of its ability to absorb this shock, are much improved.  And a lot of credit goes to Tim Geithner and his team, who were the ones that insisted on all of those things, at times over the objection of the banking system back after the crisis in 2008.
So, to sum up a lot of work that we’ve been doing here, the markets appear to be pricing in a pretty sizable shock in terms of both economic growth and profits in 2020 from this virus.  And if we do get any kind of a vaccine or an organic, a cresting of transmission rates within the next month and a half, you, I think, we would then, in the summer, in the late spring/early summer, find ourselves on the other side of this with people looking forward and taking a fresh look at how to value financial assets from there.
Just as an aside, there was a vaccine that was developed for the SARS virus.  It was developed after they didn’t need it anymore because the virus faded by late May 2003.  But they were able to find the antibody necessary to create a vaccine for SARS.  This new coronavirus COVID-19 is not the same as SARS, but it does share roughly 80% of the same underlying characteristics.  And so a lot of the scientists that we’ve spoken with suggest that they’re not starting from scratch and will be starting with pretty much of a head start in terms of trying to figure out a potential vaccine for the next season.
Now, until recently, we’ve been looking at the Democratic primary, because there is a double-whammy risk this year for financial markets investors, because the first risk was the impact of the coronavirus and the second risk for investors was that the markets would begin to price in a substantial possibility of the following scenario.  Now, there’s a lot of if’s here, but just hear me out.
Scenario one.  So, step one, Sanders wins the presidency.  Step two, Democrats retake the Senate by a small margin.  They pick up three or four seats, plus they have the—if Sanders won, they’d have the VP seat for a tiebreaker.  And third, and perhaps more importantly in this whole food chain of ideas, the new Senate majority leader, which is expected to be Chuck Schumer, has, it has been suggested to him that he kill the filibuster.  And just to be clear, without the filibuster, major legislation could be passed with a simple majority instead of by 60/40.  So, look.  Anything can happen, but, as financial market investors, that is a risk that was starting to be priced in and still exists even after the results of Super Tuesday.
And I just, I want to be clear about something because it’s very hard to have these discussions.  It’s always been hard to have these discussions, but it’s even harder now.
With respect to the progressive agenda that we’ve written a lot about, its supporters can’t have it both ways.  You can’t support an agenda which involves major restructuring and reordering of multiple sectors of the U.S. economy, whose largest companies have been driving stock market returns, without people like me saying, Well, I then have to reprice those financial assets in light of those policies.
I’m not commenting on whether I think those policies are good or bad, or whether I agree with them, or whether I would support them, or whether I wouldn’t support them.  All I’m doing is saying, Well, therefore, if Policy X, Y, and Z are implemented, it has the following impact on this financial asset price.
And so, as we talk through politics, starting now through to the end of this year’s election, I’m hoping that everyone understands that people like myself are in the position of having to evaluate things like, well, if we’re going to raise corporate tax rates, that’s going to affect valuation of corporate cashflows.  If we decide to ban hydraulic fracturing, which accounts for 60% to 80% of U.S. oil and gas production, that’s going to have implications for deficits in the dollar and imported energy, and geopolitical risk, and things like that.  If we prohibit or curb stock buybacks, we’re going to be inhibiting the single largest sources of demand for U.S. equities over the last few years, which has been companies themselves.
So, all of these things are about tradeoffs and the price that financial assets experience in light of those tradeoffs.  And none of this is meant to be some kind of value discussion or value judgment.
And, now, of course, things look a little bit different than they did a few days ago.  Most of the research I read a few days ago suggested that by the end of Super Tuesday Sanders would have a commanding lead.  Biden now has, based on our estimates, a slight lead in delegates of about a hundred delegates.  Remember, it takes 1,990 to win, and we think he’s got something like 690, and Sanders may have something like 580.  But those numbers are a little bit of in flux because it takes time to allocate these delegates after the state primaries.
The bottom line here is that there are several things that have to happen before the progressive agenda, as outlined, would impact financial asset prices, but, I think, some people go too far in assuming that, Oh, well, that’ll never happen because of the Senate.  You have to take a very close look at what happens with the filibuster.
And I’ll leave you with two things to think about.  The first is Harry Reid, who’s the former Senate majority leader for the Democratic party, wrote an article last year in the New York Times, saying the filibuster is suffocating the will of the people and is advising the next Senate majority leader to scarp it, particularly if they have a chance of implementing a once-in-a-lifetime progressive agenda.
And the second thing is there was an article in the Atlantic Monthly recently that talked about how Schumer voted against the U.S. Mexico trade pact, even though 80% of Democrats in Congress supported it.  And they speculated that he’s concerned about hearing a primary challenge from his left in the next couple of years.  And if that’s the case, there could be implications for the new Senate majority leader’s decision on the filibuster as well.
So, the details matter here.  It does seem like, in the wake of Super Tuesday, that this is going to be a closer race and that Sanders is not going to, that markets are not going to price in a Sanders’ victory quite so quickly.  There’s still a lot of delegates to go.  Take a look at the Eye on the Market that came out today.  It’s got a whole bunch of charts in here, including a really interesting one for history buffs with an ideological roadmap for the ideology, the partisanship score for every candidate that’s ever run for the Democratic presidential nomination in the modern era.
Okay.  That’s a lot longer than usual, but there’s a lot of things going on.  Thank you for listening, and I’ll talk to you next time.

MR. MICHAEL CEMBALEST:
Good morning.  This is Michael Cembalest with the eye in the market podcast.  Just some quick comments on the phase 1 China US deal.  Most of the consensus reactions have been pretty negative and skeptical, but I think they're missing the broader point.  You can read elsewhere about what they agreed to, I'll just give you some key terms and conditions of the deal.  China agreed to by another 200 billion in U.S. exports over a baseline, 2017 level.
There were some commitments by China to increase penalties on intellectual property infringements and language around you don't have to give China your technology plans as a condition of accessing their market.  There were some larger broader reductions of Chinese important restrictions on U.S. agricultural goods.  Lots of financial services liberalization, most of which was already underway.  A ban on competitive devaluation and some language around dispute resolution.  As I mentioned most of the consensus opinions are pretty skeptical that one of the Chief Economists in J.P. Morgan's Investment Bank doesn't believe the trade deficit is going to change.
Because all it's going to do is increase demand for U.S. imports, reduce the attractiveness of some of these exports to countries other than China because of an impact on the exchange rate.  And so then the net trade deficit won't change.  Other people have commented on how all that will happen is the U.S. trade deficit will be rearranged and we'll have a smaller deficit with China and a bigger one with everybody else.  There is concerns about the fact that so far this trade war has been kind of a loser.  Most of the data shows that U.S. consumers have absorbed 100% of the tariff costs.
They took a large bite out of global GDP and earnings growth and that the deal is not good enough to reverse some of the negative momentum that we saw towards the end of last year, in terms of trucking employment falling, rising farm bankruptcies and things like that.  So there is a lot of policy skepticism around the fact how can China import so much more U.S. manufactured goods at the same time that the U.S. is also imposing all of these large sanctions on Huawei, which is one of the biggest customers of U.S. technology firms?
Similarly, won't all the problems at Boeing be another problem for this deal, because how can China reach this manufactured goods imports target given their decision to switch recently from Boeing to Airbus?  Other concerns are about clauses in the deal saying that the agricultural commitments only have to be met according to market conditions, which is obviously a clause that means different things to different people.  And there is rampant skepticism about China's ability to really change their intellectual property behavior.
They've made a lot of these promises before, hasn't done much, and China's legal system really isn't set up to start processing some of these cases.  It's not known for its openness, transparency, or fairness.  And then almost everybody is saying that the phase 2 talks won't yield any results in the future because that's where they intend to cover China's domestic subsidies to their champion companies, national owned companies and that they won't change.
And then there's just other skepticism about the fact that China and the U.S. have a dispute resolution which would allow either side to restart the trade war if it thinks that the other side has abrogated terms of the agreement.  And then lastly I got a lot of feedback that the people that thought the deal was just time to drown out the impeachment hearings, and Trump then use the signing session as an opportunity to talk about Lindsey Graham's golf game and the max 3737 issue.  And lastly he asked Mary Erdoes who was our asset management CEO, who was in attendance, to thank him for the firm’s earnings.
A lot of the skepticism is a little bit beside the point.  Let's think about the alternative where nothing was done, where the administration just kept the policies going as usual.  What did we have up until that point?  We had unchecked Chinese mercantilism, and with China having the least receptive foreign direct investment inward investment regime other than the Saudis.  In other words, harder to invest in China anywhere except Saudi Arabia.  More and more rounds of these China US strategic economic dialogue talks that Bush and Obama administration has held for years since 2006 and which basically accomplished nothing.  To 300 to 600 billion dollars a year of annual losses to the economy from counterfeit goods, pirated software, theft of trade secrets, things like that.
And then the continued hollowing out of U.S. manufacturing communities.  There's been more and more research showing that very tight connection between rising Chinese exports and declining U.S. manufacturing jobs.  And then more specifically the negative impact of Chinese competition on U.S. workers that don't have a college degree, compared to the much smaller impact on U.S. workers that do have a college degree.  And at this point I'm not too concerned about the impact of this deal on tariffs on U.S. consumers.  They've received an enormous windfall over the last 15 years from Chinese trade and a redistribution from consumers back to U.S. manufacturing workers.
If it happened, we reverse a very small part of that distortion.  And there is a ton of research out there showing the impact of increased Chinese imports in the U.S. leading to a very large fall in that industry CPI.  And that's basically been going on since 2000, 2001.  There is actually some data showing that increased Chinese imports generated benefits to consumers through lower prices, equal to about 100,000 dollars per lost manufacturing job.
So I think the bigger picture here is that like a lot of divorces, that we're all familiar with, unwinding the status quo was always going to hurt and was never going to be easy.  China showed absolutely no intention of responding to U.S. concerns until this tariff war started and it's unreasonable to think that any serious renegotiation of trade and investment could ever have been achieved without any economic damage on both sides.
We had over a decade of these strategic dialogue talks that basically involved a lot of stonewalling on both sides.  So I don't know if this deal is going to lead to fairer trade, but from a U.S. perspective anyway it moves in that direction.  And it also tries to codify some kind of acceptable rules of engagement for the largest participants in the global economy, specifically China.  And for this reasons I think it deserves a little more credit than it is getting.  Again, particularly given the lack of, total lack of progress in prior Republican and Democratic administrations on this topic.  So there is risk of re-escalation and I don't think foreign direct investment in both directions will ever go back to where it was.
But the worst-case trade war outcomes look like they're off the table.  The Chinese purchase commitments of U.S. exports are pretty substantial indications of a willingness to compromise, even if they're not reached in full.  And some capital spending plans are now going to get restarted around the world, which is what the equity markets are responding positively to.  So that's just some brief comments on the trade conflict.  Thank you for listening and we'll talk to you soon.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.First and foremost, understand how taxes will impact the distributions you receive—before they’re paid.Alyssa Zebrowsky, Wealth Advisor
Trusts are commonly used wealth planning vehicles. Yet many beneficiaries don’t anticipate how the structure of their trusts may impact their entire financial pictures, from what they spend and how they invest to meeting their expectations and making future plans.
Moreover, because trusts do not have to conform to a single structure, beneficiaries of multiple trusts may well want to think carefully about how, when and in what order they receive distributions—and if the distributions they receive might impact their non-trust resources.
The devil’s in the details
Irrevocable trust distributions can vary from being completely tax free to being taxable at the highest marginal tax rates, and in some cases, can be even higher. Therefore, understanding the tax implications is critically important—which is why we focus on irrevocable trusts in the discussion below. In contrast, distributions from revocable trusts are not taxable to the beneficiary.
Grantors, too, should examine whether or not the characteristics of the trust(s) they have created are benefiting—or likely to benefit—their heirs (and their decision making) to the degree originally intended.
Your J.P. Morgan team, along with your estate planning attorney, can help you gather and assess the information you need. This article can help you get started
1
.
How irrevocable trusts work
There are three distinct components to consider:
First, understand how the trust operates
Among the questions to have answered:
Are you a current or future beneficiary? That is, will you receive distributions of income or principal now—or later, when the current beneficiaries’ interest terminates?
Who is the trustee? Does the trustee have authority over investments and distributions? Or, is there a third party whose authority on investments and/or distributions supersedes that of the trustee?
Next, determine the tax characteristics
As a beneficiary, there are several key things you will want to know:
Is the trust a
grantor trust
for income tax purposes? If so, the grantor is responsible for paying U.S. and state income taxes owed by the trust, and the beneficiaries will not owe income taxes on distributions they receive from the trust. Even so, for estate tax purposes, the assets in an irrevocable grantor trust may be considered outside of the grantor’s estate and therefore not subject to estate taxes at the grantor’s death.
Is the trust a
non-grantor trust
for income tax purposes? Then keep in mind, the trust is the taxpayer for any trust income not distributed to a beneficiary (i.e., accumulated income), and may be taxed in several jurisdictions: the state in which the trustee resides, in the state in which the grantor resided when the trust was created, and/or in the state in which a trust beneficiary resides.
As an example: A non-grantor trust established in Delaware by a Florida resident has four beneficiaries who live in Colorado, California, Illinois and Florida, respectively. Because California taxes the accumulated income of trusts that have a California resident beneficiary, the income is subject to California state income tax. However, this income is not subject to tax in Delaware, Colorado, Illinois or Florida.
Are the trust assets exempt from generation-skipping transfer (GST)
2
taxes?
At your death, will the trust assets be subject to estate taxes?
Lastly, understand the distribution provisions
Does the trustee have discretion under the trust agreement to distribute cash or other assets to the beneficiary(ies), or are certain distributions mandatory? If you are the beneficiary of a trust that makes mandatory distributions, you likely will have a predictable income stream from that trust—and can plan accordingly (though investment decisions and investment returns can affect distribution amounts).
Conversely, if the trustee has complete discretion over distribution timing and amounts, you may not have a predictable income stream, making planning more difficult.
How a trust works may affect your goals
Your relationship to a trust (grantor, beneficiary) can enhance your lifestyle and allow you to fund long-term goals, such as paying for a child’s college education or making charitable gifts. Consider:
Grantor
—If you are the grantor of an irrevocable grantor trust, then you will need to pay the taxes due on trust income from your own assets—rather than from assets held in the trust—and to plan accordingly for this expense. Financial modeling can help determine whether this additional expense is sustainable without compromising your other goals.
Beneficiary
—When trusts make (at a minimum) annual mandatory distributions, beneficiaries can reasonably expect a reliable stream of income. However, this may not be the case if distributions are made solely at the discretion of the trust’s trustees. In such instances: If you don’t need discretionary distributions to accomplish your goals, you may want to inform the trustee of this fact. The trustee may then invest those assets with a longer time horizon in mind, since the remainder beneficiaries will ultimately receive these assets years into the future. (All else being equal, remainder beneficiaries stand to inherit more from a trust that does not currently make distributions and whose assets are invested with long-term growth as its primary investment goal.)
Case study: Trust distribution strategy
In this example, a widower with his own assets is also the beneficiary of several trusts that were funded upon the death of his spouse. Taken together, the accounts hold $25 million in investable assets—to which the widower has varying levels of access:Withdrawal strategy:
Minimize taxes
To minimize future transfer and income taxes to the extent possible, the widower worked with his advisors to implement a strategy for his spending, investing and gifting:
Spending order
—The plan is to first draw from the accounts that are subject to his estate taxes to meet his spending needs, and then from accounts that are exempt from estate taxes, as follows: Required Minimum Distributions (RMD) from his IRA; individual brokerage account and Marital GST Non-Exempt Trust; additional IRA withdrawals; Bypass GST Non-Exempt Trust; Bypass GST Exempt Trust.
Asset allocation
—The overall allocation of the $25 million in investable assets is 60% are in equities; 40% in fixed income. The assets that will be spent first are more conservatively invested than those that will be spent last, meaning most of the fixed income investments are held in the brokerage account and Marital Trust. The equities are in the Bypass Trusts.
Treatment of charitable gifts
—As part of his own estate plan, the widower plans to use funds from his retirement account (IRA) and personal assets, along with funds from trusts subject to the most estate taxes,
6
to make charitable gifts. He will not make donations using funds in his GST-exempt funds.
We can help
We understand that trusts can be complex, with many considerations to take into account. Your J.P. Morgan team, along with our Wealth Advisors, Wealth Strategists and Trust Officers, can work with you and your tax advisors to create a distribution strategy that both meets both your day-to-day spending needs and your longer-term estate plans.
1
For the purposes of this discussion, we assume that the trust, grantor and beneficiaries are all U.S. entities or individuals. The outcomes may vary for foreign trusts, grantors and/or beneficiaries.
2
The GST exemption is the same amount as the U.S. estate and gift tax exclusion: currently, $12.06 million and twice that for couples. However, these amounts are scheduled to be cut roughly in half when the current legislation expires at the end of 2025, unless Congress acts otherwise. In 2022, the GST tax rate is 40%.
3
The Marital Trust holds assets passing to the widower from his spouse’s estate in excess of the amount that could pass free of estate tax. The assets will be includable in the widower’s estate at his death.
4
The GST Non-Exempt Trust is subject to the GST when distributed to a grandchild or more remote descendant.
5
The Bypass Trust—sometimes referred to as a Family Trust or Credit Shelter Trust—received the amount that could pass free of estate tax upon the death of the spouse. It is not
includable
in the widower’s gross estate upon his passing, and therefore will not be subject to estate tax. The GST Exempt Trust is not subject to the generation-skipping transfer tax, and thus can pass from generation to generation with no additional estate, gift or generation-skipping tax liability.
6
The widow can use the trust assets as long as she has a power of appointment that includes charitable beneficiaries.This example directs the widower to spend assets from each account in the following order. First, spend the assets in the estate that are subject to the generation-skipping tax (GST). Second, spend the assets outside of the estate that are subject to the GST. Lastly, spend the assets outside of the estate that are not subject to the GST.Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.

MR. MICHAEL CEMBALEST:
Good afternoon.  This is Michael Cembalest with the Eye on the Market podcast from my remote location.  There is an Eye on the Market called Man vs. Nature, and the point is to focus on the things the government can try and fix and what it can't.  It is mostly– it is a pretty quick read; it's mostly charts.
Let me just walk you through what we have in here.  We have some high-frequency manufacturing and consumer data measures.  These things are pretty hard to revive just with monetary and fiscal policy obviously, when there is lockdowns in place.  And so the idea is we're going to start tracking the coincidence of infections, lockdowns, and economic activity the same way we are doing in China.
In terms of that jobless claim number last week, it's not quite the same number- that surge that you get during a typical demand led recession given the speed with which people might go back to work this time once the lockdowns are lifted, and also provisions in the stimulus bill designed to incentivize companies to hire these fired workers back.  But still, we are bracing for pretty sharp downward jolt in economic activity in both Q2 and then again in Q3.  So what we are going to start doing though, is again tracking how some of these various measures play out to give us an indication of when financial markets might bottom.
And there is a page in here where we walked through a history of labor markets and asset prices.  And I don't know if the March 23 close on the S&P of 2200 is going to mark the low for the cycle.  It's probably too early for that.  But when the bottom does occur I expect it to be pretty consistent with prior cycles in both the U.S. and Europe in which the equity markets a bottom way before unemployment starts declining.  And usually, markets bottom even as unemployment is still rising.  The best example of that was during the stag-flation era of the 1970s.  Equities bottomed when unemployment was just starting to rise.  You know, the tech collapse was the big exception.
The other thing we are starting to measure in terms of what the government can't control, is the Fed's ability to alleviate a credit crunch.  There is a whole bunch of credit facilities that have been designed to alleviate the pressure in the credit markets.  The first thing to note is that in most cases, not all, but in most cases, the spread widening so far is much smaller than in 2008 which I think reflects improvements in the plumbing and capitalization in the banking sector.
And the most remarkable chart to me is the one that shows how bank debt spreads have barely budged versus other investment-grade issuers whereas in 2008 the bank spreads blew out by 2 to 300 basis points versus other investment-grade bonds.  So there is evidence that the improvements to the financial system are having an impact this time around.
So we see value given all these fed facilities and investment-grade credit, some selected municipal issuers and some upper tier non-energy high-yield.  And we have a whole bunch of charts in here, all of which are also posted in our online coronavirus portal, and which are updated frequently.  So you can see what is coming on in terms of libor versus the Fed funds rate and versus treasuries, commercial paper, investment-grade corporate bonds, as I mentioned, mortgages, high yield, preferreds, emerging markets, leverage loans, things like that.  So what we are doing is we are tracking how those things are trading and I do think what the Fed is doing here is putting something of a floor underneath some of the most high quality issues.  And again, that is where we do see some value.
Now, on to the other things that governments can't fix so easily.  There has been a little bit of the unraveling of the chloroquine story.  And I just want to make it very clear many of the antiviral studies that you have seen reported in the press so far don't meet any of the qualifications of what is typically a lengthy and complex process of randomized trials and control groups and population sets and things like that and that are designed to demonstrate the efficacy and the safety of some of these drugs.
And while some of them may be used eventually to combat the disease, it is a little premature based on these nonrandomized trials of 20 or 30 people to draw comprehensive inferences about their effectiveness.  And we have some– an interesting chart here showing that, while there were thousands of antiviral drugs proposed in the scientific literature over the last 50 years, only 90 of them have ever been approved for final use.  And around half of those were just for HIV on its own.
And while there is some perspective here that I think is worth looking at, we show the results of some of the– some of the live trials and some of the cell culture trials, but I just want to walk through just for a second, it's now clear that some of the studies that have been floating around in the press were completely nonrandomized trials.  There were no discussions of clinical outcomes.  Some of the recipients of the drugs weren’t discussed in the final results.  Sometimes the control group had a more intense measure of the virus starting out than the infected patients which could explain why the control group was still infected at the end.  And a bunch of other things in here.
So the chloroquine study has been muddied further by other studies which have found no benefits at all in looking at control groups versus these things.  So the big issue is that there is enough rationale, I think, to continue investigating some of these drugs, antiviral drugs that have been approved for other diseases in COVID-19 patients in hospitalized settings.  But the idea that they are– that they should be used as a preventive on a prophylactic basis I don't think stands up right now.  And in any case, if we have an update on all of the antiviral and vaccine stuff going on.
And the last thing I wanted to comment on this week is some of you have asked why we haven't published any prediction curves for the infections.  And there is a two pager here at the end of the Eye on the Market on Monday which gets into that.  It is really only for people that like math.  So I have to warn you, if you don't like math you do not want to read this.
But, there are these epidemic outbreak models based on the SIR model that was developed in the '20s.  We've adapted a version of it and it estimates the number of active infections in a given exposed population based on the rate of new infections, recoveries, mortalities, infectiousness, removal rates and a bunch of other things.  It sounds very scientific but there is a lot of very, very manual curve fitting going on.  And the big problem is it's very hard to predict reported infections for a very infectious disease like COVID-19 when you have such large numbers of infected people who are asymptomatic or for other reasons not reported because the model get confused because it has to try to reconcile the smaller number of reported cases versus what is expected.  So there is a series of charts in here that are kind of interesting.
It looks at how well the model worked in Korea, which could've been serendipity and I suspect might've been.  But even so, the model did a pretty decent job in Korea.  And if you took those parameters and you applied them at the time to what you thought was going to happen for Italy it would have been a disastrous failure.  Using the Korea parameters, it predicted a peak infection rate of 9000 in Italy and we have 62,000 just so far.
And there is too many exogenous variables that affect the way these things work for these models to be used reliably across countries.  And you can take a look at it.  The bottom line is that these models have to be constantly updated to fit the observed infection rates in each country so what you have learned by fitting parameters for one country has almost zero value of predicting the evolution of infections in any other country.  And even the predictions you make within a country can shift wildly with testing and policy changes.  So the best you can do, is use them to provide a very rough estimate of infection trajectories for a single country assuming that policy testing and behaviors don't change and you could still be wrong.  So far what I have seen is that these models are most accurate when the infection rates have already peaked, at which point they become moot and you don't need them anymore.
So anyway that is the story.  Again, we have all of our coronavirus materials on markets, economics, vaccines, infections, mortality and all the charts derived from that data are updated on a high-frequency basis on our coronavirus research page.  Take a look online and we will talk to you again soon.

MR. MICHAEL CEMBALEST:
Good morning and welcome to the Eye on the Market for late September.  In our September 8
th
piece, we reviewed many of the market and economic issues at stake in the election.  So with one month to go, I just wanted to briefly mention two last topics.  The first is the election as a referendum on the US.  And the second is how should we think about the rising possibility of a very, very contested election process?
So on the first point, I was reading some J.P. Morgan Investment Bank research at the end of August, and they had a piece where they recommended that investors position for rising odds that Trump gets reelected.  And the primary point of their argument was the protests that are going on and that if those protests are seen as violent, that could materially affect voting patterns.  They cited some other research they had read showing that demonstrations at a county level in 1960 through 972 in the United States boosted Republican vote outcomes by about 2 to 8%.
And I know it sounds very mathematical, but this is not 1960 and 1972 when most Americans still trusted the federal government as an antidote, as a prevention from chaos, and when violent crime rates were quickly rising.  And in a poll this month, around 60% of respondents said they thought the administration’s response to the protests were harmful, compared to only 30% that thought they were helpful. And I guess my response to the investment banking piece is that while some voters may see the administration as guardians against lawlessness, there may be just as many, if not more voters who see the current administration as purveyors of it.
In any case, I think rather than focusing on the protests in isolation, this election may be a referendum on how well the overall system works in America and for whom.  And I took the World Bank high income universe, and I broke it down into a lot of different categories, using a lot of different sources to see how does the US stack up against the rest of the world, ‘cause I think that may also be influencing how people vote this year.
So unsurprisingly, and there’s a chart in here that shows you all these rankings, the US ranks at the very top for equity investors and for entrepreneurs.  We have lower regulatory burdens, lower tax burdens.  It’s much easier as a manager of a company to hire and fire people, easier to do business, and the legal system is oriented to resolve commercial disputes quickly and fairly.  All of those things contribute to top decile profits growth and equity returns.
Now let’s look at for workers, how does the system work for workers?  The US ranks above average on median income, whether adjusted for purchasing power or not, on housing costs, and the OECD has a measure of a better life that looks at jobs, housing, work/life balance, environment, and personal safety.  And the US ranks still above average on those kinds of things.
But that’s where the rankings start to slip after that.  There are cracks in the US judicial and legal system.  The US now ranks median or below on judicial independence and corruption.  The US ranks below median on homelessness, basic education, on math, science, and reading, healthcare, including COVID mortality. The US ranks very poorly on income distribution, generational mobility and poverty, and ranks at the very bottom on civil and criminal justice and discrimination.
So some of these problems have existed for decades, of course.  But I think this year, voters are going to be more inclined than ever to judge an incumbent president, on whether his administration made some of these problems better on the margin or made them worse.  So you can take a look at the chart that shows these different rankings, ‘cause I have a feeling that this broader context and referendum is going to be more impactful on the overall voting patterns than the protests in isolation.
So what kind of election results are we going to get and when?  Everybody is aware right now that there’s going to be a surge in mail-in voting this year.  Could be 40%, 50% in some states, nobody really knows.  And given the relentless criticism of the mail-in voting process by both Trump and his attorney general, I had included on Labor Day an election primer on how the election works.
And what we said at the time is still true, which is on January 6th, Congress will almost certainly do one of three things: Either announce a president based on the Electoral College results, or announce a contingent election that’s held by the House to choose a new President if the Electoral College fails to produce a candidate that gets a majority of accepted votes, or if the contingent election fails to produce a winning candidate, designate the speaker of the House as a temporary acting president until sufficient rounds of voting in the contingent election in the House determine a winner.
And I think I may have made it sound simpler than it is, because the primer that we had didn’t cover all of the steps that are fraught with potential for legal uncertainty, judicial interpretation, gamesmanship in this kind of stuff.  And with the president of the United States being cited as having declined to commit to a peaceful transfer of power, you know we want to take another look at this.  So what we did in this week’s piece is to look at some of the uncertainties that we didn’t discuss in our Labor Day piece.  I’m just going to tick through them really quickly here, and you can look at this for more detail.
But six weeks from November 3
rd
to December 14
th
when the Electoral College meets sounds like a long time but may not be.  And one of the primary reasons is in states that have requested automatic recounts, those absentee ballots may end up having to be counted twice.
There have been Supreme Court decisions that require states to extend voting deadlines from having your mail-in ballot received on Election Day.  And now that they’re requiring it be postmarked on Election Day.  And there are going to be countless opportunities for election lawyers to file court challenges, alleging violations and all those kinds of stuff, all of which could result in more than one set of electoral results being submitted from a state.
In the prior primer, I mentioned that in most states it’s the secretary of state in each state that oversees and certifies the election results, and that’s true.  But in other states, the governor and the state legislature as well may have equal standing.  And they may just decide to submit a separate slate of electoral results to the Congress, to the Electoral College.  And then Congress would have to sort out which electoral state to approve.
The other thing that’s important to point out is if some electoral votes are not reported by December 14
th
or they get rejected by Congress for procedural reasons, there’s a chance that Congress would select the president based on less than 270 electoral votes.  In other words, if 20 electoral votes from the state of Pennsylvania just were not submitted in time or were thrown out, Congress could select the president based on whether or not someone who received a majority of the electoral votes that were submitted.
So instead of needing 270, you would need 270 minus ten, which would be half of the 20 plus one.  So there are circumstances under which election lawyers would have an incentive to tie up states in the courts for as long as they possibly could, hoping that their results would get thrown out of both the numerator and the denominator of Electoral College.
And that opens up a whole string of unknowns, which is what if a state doesn’t complete its vote count until after the 14th?  Will Congress accept the results?  It could be unconstitutional, against federal law to count electoral votes submitted after the 14
th
‘cause that would mean that the process is not uniform across all states, which is one of the requirements.
What if a state submits results by the 14
th
but have only counted 97% of the ballots and know that there’s a small number of absentee ballots that remain uncounted?  That may also be unconstitutional.  And then there’s also issues about faithless electors.  What would Congress do if the Electoral College were really close in early December, but on the 14
th
a few electors decide to throw the election to another candidate or to abstain from voting to force a contingent election?
So there’s a lot of scenarios that we walk through in here.  And of course there’s always the nightmare scenario that you almost had in 1876 of dueling inaugurations, where each party declares a different winner.  Like most Americans, I think I’m praying for time so that this process can be carried out fairly and accurately and that we have a winner that’s clear well before the Electoral College meets in December.
But again, given the rising and relentless criticism of the mail-in voting process by the president and some members of his cabinet, we thought it was important to update everybody on what we know and we don’t know about the process itself.  So more to come hopefully shortly after Election Day, thank you.

[THEME MUSIC]
MR. MICHAEL CEMBALEST:  Good morning, this is Michael Cembalest with the Eye on the Market podcast. And today I'm going to be discussing our tenth annual energy paper. I know we're all still focused on the virus; as things stand now there's been a spike in infections. The U.S. is now running one of the highest infection rates in the world, including compared to all sorts of developed and emerging economies.
The only silver lining here is that the spike in infections is not translating yet into a spike in deaths and hospitalizations, which continue to decline, even in some of the hotspot states like Arizona, Texas, Florida, et cetera. So we'll see if that stays in place. There's arguments for and against the status quo continuing, which we'll continue to monitor, along with all the developments in terms of antivirals, monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, et cetera on our coronavirus web portal.
In any case we released our tenth annual energy paper this week. And I just wanted to highlight some of what's in there. It's a long piece; it's our tenth annual one. When I started writing about energy ten years ago I knew that we needed a technical advisor to shepherd me through some of the complexities of the energy ecosystem, and Vaclav Smil has been our technical advisor during this entire time, and it's been a pleasure and incredibly insightful and rewarding to have worked with him. And he worked with us again on this year's paper.
So the interesting thing about COVID is that it knocked CO
2
emissions all the way back to where they were in 2006, but this is obviously a very temporary reduction. Already we're seeing the Chinese coal and oil demand is back to pre-pandemic levels and air traffic in China is recovering. The EIA expects a full recovery in global liquid fuels consumption to pre-COVID levels by, you know, no later than June of next year. So all of what's happening right now, with respect to the emissions declines are temporary.
And what I wanted to focus on this year, as much as we could, is what kind of renewable energy transitions could deliver a more durable decline in emissions. Obviously it's not sustainable to have the world in an economic lockdown; what kind of renewable energy transmissions could translate into similar declines in global emissions?
And so there's a bunch of different topics that we cover in here. One of the overarching themes to remember is that historical data is relevant; the history of energy transitions is that it takes as long as 30 to 40 years for a new energy type to reach 15 or 20 percent of global primary energy consumption. When you look at the transition from wood to coal and from coal to oil and from oil to natural gas, those transitions took many decades just for those new fuels to reach 15 to 20 percent.
Now that we're finally at roughly four percent contribution of renewables to world primary energy consumption some of the forecasts we see are unfortunately way too hockey stick-y optimistic in terms of where we go from here. And one of the things to remember is, while the energy efficiency of the world is getting much better in terms of CO
2
intensity per unit of growth, absolute levels of emissions keep rising, and they're rising for a reason, which is that the developed world has outsourced the energy-intensive manufacturing to the emerging countries really over the last 25 years. So it's all well and good that the United States and Europe, and to a lesser extent, Japan, figure out ways of decarbonizing their electricity grids, but now that we've outsourced manufacturing, ammonia, steel and cement production to the emerging world, that's where a lot of the emissions are taking place, and that's where a lot of the new technologies would have to be applied to make a difference.
So one of the things that we go through here is where primary energy comes from, where electricity comes from. Some of the important takeaways is that globally only about 20 percent of all energy consumed actually comes from electricity; the rest of it is direct energy consumption in transportation and by industry, and to a lesser extent, homes and buildings.
Even if you electrified the entire electricity grid, which is of course impossible--I'm sorry, even if you decarbonized the entire electricity grid with renewable energy--you would only really be decarbonizing 20 percent of global energy consumption. So understanding the limitations of decarbonizing the grid with wind and solar on this whole question of emissions is an important thing to understand, and highlights the importance of some kind of decarbonization progress in direct industrial use and in transportation, both of which are moving along really slowly.
I have a lot of energy discussions with clients, with friends and with family, and some of them are interesting; almost all of them are interesting. Some of them are difficult. People have a lot of preconceived notions of things. And one of the sections this year in the paper is called The Ten Energy Commandments, because it's the ten most important things to try and understand about the world of energy and climate as you dive into this, if you're interested in getting into the details.
So I'm not going to go through all of the specifics now, but I'm going to tick through the topics that we discussed, one of which is why are the rapid, rapid declines in wind and solar levelized costs not translating into a faster pace of decarbonization on a global basis. And there's all sorts of issues there in terms of transmission costs and politics and intermittency and seasonality and things like that.
One of the things we discuss is how important it is not to conflate the speed of wind and solar costs declines with the speed of decarbonization. One of the other topics we get into in some detail is is it possible to electrify a lot of industrial processes that right now rely on coal and natural gas, so that if the grid were eventually decarbonized with renewables you could essentially have green energy production in industry.
It's not so simple; there are certain industrial processes that can be electrified; others can't. And even when you can, the cost per unit of energy for electricity is three to six times more expensive than natural gas. Now you can solve that with a carbon tax but let's see whether or not any countries have the appetite to set that carbon tax at a level that will equilibrate those two costs in terms of renewable electricity versus natural gas. So far we haven't seen anybody do that. It's simple to say, ""let's decarbonize the industrial sector""; it's a lot harder when you get at the specifics of actually doing it.
We talk about energy storage. Some of the proposals for energy storage involve overbuilding massive amounts of wind and solar and then drawing down on stored energy in winter months so that you can turn off the natural gas peaker plants. The utility scale battery storage industry is in its infancy, and understanding the challenges there are important in understanding the feasibility of some of these more aggressive assumptions on using wind and solar to decarbonize the entire grid.
And then we've got a section on politics. In New Hampshire people effectively shut down a project that was going to solve a lot of the energy problems in the Northeast by importing hydropower from Canada, and they objected to it because they didn't want the high-voltage, direct current line bringing the power down. And so the New Hampshire siting council rejected it, and the federal government did not use any of its powers to overrule them. So sometimes there are some clean solutions that fall to the wayside because of politics. And instead, the Northeast is going to have to import natural gas from West Virginia and Ohio and other places and combust it in natural gas combined cycle plants instead of using Canadian hydropower because of politics.
We get into the question of the false narratives on carbon capture and storage and carbon mineralization, and some of these things that sounds great on paper but which tend to fall apart once you get into the engineering challenges. And we talk about the importance of reforestation, but not overestimating both the impact of replanting trees on actual CO2 sequestration, and the challenge involved with replanting millions of acres when the U.S. Forest Service tends to replant about 100,000 acres a year.
So we talk about the hydrogen economy, we talk about voluntary carbon offsets that airlines are looking at, and then we get into questions about ride hailing, and finally U.S. consumption in terms of cars, housing and food, and how those consumption patterns, if they change, could make a material impact on U.S. emissions a lot more than something like carbon capture.
Then separately from this whole question of the renewable transition we get into the question--two questions, on the oil and gas markets, which is are we now at the point of peak U.S. energy independence, and secondly what's the real reason for this dreadful performance of oil and gas stocks which were at their lowest valuations relative to the market in 90 years. Is it a stranded asset risk, or is it a supply shock?
And so, again, no time on a podcast to get into all the details, but on the question of U.S. energy dependence the U.S. has finally reached a level of U.S. energy independence that Nixon and every president since him talked about since the 1970s; we are now a net exporter, if you look in energy terms, across oil and natural gas and coal. But there are some challenges here, first of which is about 40 percent of all U.S. energy consumption is based on U.S. production that comes from hydraulic fracturing.
So there are two big issues, one of which is the water usage and water disposal demands of hydraulic fracturing and how that evolves with potentially-changing politics. And the second is even before COVID the investing in the U.S. shale revolution was something of a train wreck. If you look at the industry for a decade in aggregate it had negative free cashflow. I mean I've never seen anything like this. I've seen a few years where airlines and casinos and cable and things like that in the '80s and '90s had a few years of capital investment and it took them a while to recoup that. But I've never seen anything like a full decade where in aggregate the entire industry had negative free cashflow. And I think of 29 shale companies only a few ever posted a couple of years where they were free cashflow positive. So this was an industry that was built on growth and revenues, rather than profitability, and that started to crumble even before COVID.
So to me, given the rapid decline rates in shale wells, both in gas and oil, we're facing some challenges in terms of U.S. energy independence because the combination of the financial pressures on the industry, plus the political and environmental pressures on the industry, could bring this era of U.S. independence to an end, and we take a close look at that in section two of the paper.
And then the topic that was also interesting to us is there's a lot of people that believe the underperformance of oil and gas stocks are because of stranded asset risk. In other words the market is not valuing any of the reserve finds because within some period of decades the world's not going to need those reserves, so you're wasting money on E&P to try and find them.
And there are certainly some academic studies and some policy people that believe that, and so it's something to take a look at. I continued to believe that a big part of the explanation for the underperformance of oil and gas is a supply shock, rather than this question of stranded asset risks. If you look at the U.S. shale boom the vast majority of it reduced imports, rather than being exported. So you had this domestic supply shock, you had this explosion of production, a collapse in profitability, and again the S&P 1500 oil and gas sector had 13 consecutive years of negative free cash flow.
And so the lack of capital discipline, both by the investors in these companies, and the companies themselves I think is a better explanation, particularly considering when you look on a long-term basis there's a lot of different scenarios out there. Some scenarios--the IEA, the International Energy Agency, has one--some scenarios project that the world is going to leave millions of tons of oil equivalents, of oil and gas and coal, in the ground, because they won't be needed over the next few decades.
You should take a look at what the underlying assumptions are for that sustainable development scenario in terms of a dramatic increase in wind and solar, and 50 percent electric vehicles, up from maybe one or two percent right now, a collapse in the energy utilization of buildings, a decline in actual energy demand in countries like the United States, back to 1988 levels, despite a huge growth in population. So this sustainable development scenario is possible. And if that actually happened you'd have a lot of stranded asset risks.
But when I look at it the world certainly is not on the trajectory of the IEA sustainable development scenario right now, and I'm tempted to think that because of that what's really going on in the markets with respect to oil and gas stocks is related to their current profitability, rather than the stranded asset risk associated with the deployment or not of future reserve.
Anyway, that's enough for this week's podcast. Take a look at the paper. We're also doing a webcast at some point over the next few days, which you can sign up for, where Anton Pil and I will be talking about this. And obviously we will continue to stay focused on developments with respect to the virus and any second waves that occur. So thank you very much for listening and I will talk to you soon. Good bye.

MR. MICHAEL CEMBALEST:  Good morning, this is Michael Cembalest with the mid-May “Eye on the Market” podcast.
Around a month ago I wrote in one of the notes that the U.S. might start reopening in the middle of May due to declining infection rates. And that prediction turned out only to be half right because, while states representing almost half of U.S. GDP have announced reopening plans, the U.S. still has one of the highest COVID infection run rates in the world, and one that is declining only very slowly and has not declined more sharply, like we’ve seen in other regions such as in Europe. And given the ample evidence of heightened mortality risk for the elderly, we’re at a moment now where the risk of greater generational sacrifices is about to rise.
We are going to be tracking both the virus consequences of state reopening and also the consumer spending impact of state reopening, drawing in part from information we’re building out from our colleagues at Chase card services. We want to be able to really get an assessment for what reopening means because in different states it may mean different things, and rather than just adding up the GDP of the opened states, I think we need to take a pretty close look at what the responses are, and what the elasticity of different categories of spending are to a reopening.
Now that said, we are already picking up signs of a revived economy pulse at a national level, and we have charts in here looking at hotel occupancy rates, petroleum demand, rail traffic, mortgage applications, new business applications. There’s a decent number of high-frequency U.S. data tracker indicators that are already picking up.
One of the factors that is presumably going into these decisions to reopen is are there any treatments that can be used on a prophylactic basis for health care workers or for sick patients. The news continues to be pretty slow. There was a new antiviral trial result that showed some promise in reducing time to recovery from twelve to seven days but it involved the use of three different antivirals at once: interferon injections, multiple antibiotics and oxygen therapy. And so while the outcomes were okay and the viral load also declined more rapidly in the treated group than the control group, there weren’t that many differences for patients that were treated seven days or more after their symptoms came on. In other words, a highly-intensive hospital domicile, or hospital-only approach, it needs to be used with patients with mild to moderate symptoms, and those two things often don’t go together. In other words, people that are hospitalized with only mild symptoms.
We also had a discussion this week of the latest news on monoclonal antibody therapy, which is basically antibodies manufactured outside the human body that give a temporary immunity boost to sick patients or to health care workers. But again, these are clinical trials that are ongoing. Regeneron and some other companies are going to be taking a look more closely at these trials this summer, and could be available more quickly in a vaccine, but again, more costly, harder to produce at scale, and the impacts are temporary, usually just a few weeks.
Jumping over to the real economy and to corporate profits, last week we took at look at the haves and the have-nots of employment and how layoffs are very highly concentrated in leisure/retail, and how somewhere between 65 and 75 percent of those workers look like they may be receiving, at least for now, state and federal benefits that are equal to or greater than their pretax earnings.
This week we take a look at the high concentration of the earnings hit as well because that’s also very concentrated. It’s kind of remarkable but if you look at around 70 percent of the S&P market cap the projected earnings declines are not that bad: tech, internet retail and media, which is now, after everything that’s happened, around 40 percent of U.S. equity market cap is not expected to have much of a growth hit at all in the second quarter. And non-cyclicals, which is another third of the market, are only expected to have an earnings hit of around 20 percent, which is not that bad, given how much operating leverage a lot of these companies have. It’s the financials, and then obviously the cyclical companies that are expected to have their earnings completely decimated.
But part of the resilience of the equity market so far, and the recovery that we’ve seen is probably a reflection of that fact that more than two-thirds of the S&P market cap is projected to suffer a much smaller earnings hit. Whether that does happen in Q2, and I have my doubts, is another question. So we’re going to be monitoring the Q2 estimates really closely, given how optimistic they are for the non-cyclical stocks, in tech, internet retail and media. But if they can escape from Q2 with flat for tech and down 20 percent for the non-cyclicals, that would be a pretty good outcome.
A lot hinges on two things we don’t know yet, which is how—and I mentioned this earlier—how robust will consumer and manufacturing activity be in partially reopened states, and how large a virus infection spike would be needed to prompt a reimposition of the lockdown by the governors. And to me it feels like with the rally that’s taken place the markets are already pricing in good news on both of those questions. In other words a fairly rapid resumption of some degree of normal activity in partially-reopened states, and then, second, either the virus infection spike won’t be that big, or if it is, that the governors will have so much momentum behind the reopening decision that they would not reimpose any kind of lockdown conditions. It feels premature to me to make both of those judgments, and so, as I mentioned last week, we feel like the markets are kind of fully priced now for what the upside and downside opportunities are going forward.
And one of the remarkable things, to me, is that while 2021 earnings projections for the S&P have come down since the beginning of the year, they’re still around flat to what the actual EPS numbers were through the end of 2019. So that seems a bit optimistic, and we’ll have to see whether that plays out.
There are two final topics that I wanted to talk about in this week’s podcast. The first is a regional equity performance barbell. As many of you are aware, we’ve been following this for a long time, and I joined JPMorgan in 1987 and I have never seen any investment thesis work anywhere as consistently as this one, which is a regional overweight to the United States and emerging markets in equities and underweight Europe and Japan. There’s a chart in here showing that it’s more or less worked on a rolling three-year basis from 1991 until now, with a temporary period of underperformance in those two years of the southern European growth boom in 2005-2006.
But other than that I am actually running out of ways of imagining how this trend would ever change. Particularly this year, compared to the U.S., Europe has had a much more rapid decline in infection rates, and Japan’s infection rate barely registered at all. And yet Europe and Japanese equities are, once again, underperforming the U.S. and emerging markets.
There’s not a lot of things from the 2020 outlook have survived this pandemic but one of the more important discussions from the outlook this year, which came out in January, that’s still very relevant, are the structural advantages of U.S. equity markets compared to Europe and Japan, and specifically, number one, are much higher exposure to tech relative to basic materials, energy and industrials in the U.S. relative to the other regions. And secondly, and I think this one is even more important, within each sector, higher U.S. profitability measured as return on assets and return on equity for U.S. companies, compared to European and Japanese counterparts, within the same sectors.
So if the United States is generally comprised of stocks tilted more toward high-growth sectors, and within each sector they end up being more profitable than counterparts elsewhere, that’s a really strong structural advantage for U.S. equities, and you’d have to have a massive valuation discount in Europe and Japan to offset that and—you know, for a really long time that hasn’t happened.
Last topic: last July we wrote a special “Eye on the Market” on leverage loans because there’s been an absolute collapse in investor protections in terms of covenants. And we went into some detail on this, and there’s some data from Moody’s where they put together an index showing just how weak these covenants have become, and heading into the fourth quarter of last year they were the weakest on record in terms of investor protections. And I’m talking about things like leverage and interest coverage tests, most favored nation provisions, restricted payments clauses, leakage of assets out of the collateral pool, the ability to transfer assets to unrestricted subsidiaries and affiliates. These are the things that investors have been surrendering at a record pace.
So then you come into this year; you have this pandemic, and now we’re going to have a credit crunch and a spike in default rates. This is going to be a problem for the leveraged loan market. Now it already was, right, and almost mirroring exactly what the price action was in 2009 you had almost an immediate upfront 30 percent decline in leveraged loans in March, which is almost the same thing that happened in March 2009. And in March 2009 there was a pretty quick V-shaped recovery. I think it’s going to be a little harder this time, given the erosion of investor—creditor protections and the problems in terms of lockdown, particularly in the states where it’s prolonged, that it’s going to have on cashflow.
So to me, after this recovery, the leverage loan markets recovered around half of what it lost; to me it seems like a pretty decent time to think about shifting out of some of these leveraged loan exposures and taking a closer look at distress debt, given the expected surge in non-performing loans and other distressed assets as we head into the summer and fall of 2020.
So there’s more information on that in the “Eye on the Market” that’s coming out this week; take a close look. We also have a list of some topics that you might have missed over the last couple of weeks in the “Eye on the Markets”: we’ve addressed whether the U.S. fiscal stimulus is enough. We took a close look last time on the COVID impact on underfunded state pension and retiree health care obligations and what that implies for the Chapter 9 debate. We looked at this questionable premise about the BCG vaccine being a driver of COVID severity, and a discussion of some of the more ambitious vaccine time tables and serology results. So take a look.
Thanks for listening and I will talk to you again soon.

MR. MICHAEL CEMBALEST:
Good afternoon, everyone.  This is Michael Cembalest with the Labor Day Eye on the Market podcast.  So that was a long summer.  We sent out an Eye on the Market today, day after Labor Day, that covers a lot of ground.  I’m just going to summarize it briefly here.
The big topics are how should we think about a market that is highly concentrated in tech stocks at high valuations?  What’s the cost of engineering this US recovery as the world waits for a vaccine, looking at both what the central banks have done and fiscal deficits.  We’ll discuss some US election rules, dates, and process in light of some very derogatory comments on mail-in voting by the president and his attorney general and a few other things.
So let’s see.  Looking back in January of this year, we spent most of our time focused on the China-US trade deal and the prospects of an election in which Trump was on track to run with one of the strongest economic and market tailwinds of 100 years.  Obviously those things have both changed a lot.  China is very far from meeting its trade deal purchase commitments, but the market no longer cares about it.  And while the US economy is recovering, Trump’s once-in-a-lifetime tailwinds are gone, mostly due to the Coronavirus.
So one of the things that we did is to keep track of the cost of achieving this recovery we’ve seen so far, which has propelled the S&P 500 to all-time highs again.  There’s no question, so far the recovery looks a lot like a V, right?  If you look at industrial production and retail sales, the recovery in employment and job openings, lumber, steel, electricity output, all these things are recovering with V shapes that are much more V-shaped than the prior recession and most recessions for that matter, because it was never an organic recession to begin with because of the lockdowns.
So the issue here is that this didn’t come cheap.  The increase in fiscal deficits in central bank balance sheets, which we track for this cycle and for a few countries and regions versus global financial crisis, the European balance of payments crisis, the Depression and things like that, the world has never seen a monetary and fiscal expansion like the one that was just produced in a matter of months.
And we can debate the cost of central bank expansion in terms of risks of inflation, which I consider right now to be pretty low.  But I don’t think there’s any debate that at some point there’s going to be a price to pay for the fact that US gross federal debt is now expected to end the year at World War II peaks, over 100% of GDP.
And so as an exercise, not that I think either party would consider doing this, but as an exercise, we worked with the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget to figure out what would it take to bring US federal debt back to pre-virus levels by 2030.
So in other words, let’s spend the next ten years reversing the last six months of debt expansion.  And it would take the largest tax hikes or spending cuts in history, or we could grow our way out of it, but it would take a growth boom in terms of real GDP growth consistently above 4%, somewhere between 4 and 6%.  And the last time that happened was the mid-1960s, so more than 50 years ago.
So it’s very unlikely that the US is going to be able to bring these debt levels back down, and I don’t think there is the political will to do this.  And so the US will just have to get used to very high, not quite Italian, but almost Italian levels of government debt.  I agree that it was the right thing to do for now, because it sustains private sector demand, and the benefits outweigh the cost to the economy.  But these experiments can have a lot of unprecedented consequences.  And down the road, the US flexibility to respond to all sorts of geopolitical natural disaster, climate, and other emergencies will be impaired by having this level of debt.
So to be clear, US debt levels may rise even further, right.  I mean Trump has been running massive deficits at the time of full employment before the virus.  And Biden’s agenda proposes about $5 trillion worth of taxes and $8 trillion of spending.  So if anything, roughly proportional, like the Biden proposals goes through.  If he’s elected we’ll have a lot of increase in the US debt anyway.
Some people respond to this Biden plan very negatively.  I think for me it’s a split decision.  A lot of the items that Biden wants to spend money on have pretty high growth multipliers, whether it’s housing, education, infrastructure, and jobs, and some of the healthcare, but not all, some of the healthcare proposals.
So I don’t think it is a priori negative for economic growth.  I do think there would be some headwinds for the corporate sector.  Because a big, very big part of how this spending expansion would be financed would be through corporate taxes.  And one of the things that you have to pay close attention to is Biden’s people are clever in the way they say this.  They say we’re only going to raise corporate taxes by half of the Trump corporate tax rate cut.
But the rates aren’t the way to look at this.  If you include all the base broadening and sector-specific tax proposals, Biden’s proposing raising up to around $2.5 trillion of new corporate taxes.  That’s many multiples higher than the reduction in taxes that came with the Trump corporate tax cuts in 2017.  So there will be another time and place to talk about the wealth taxes.  I mean there’s, between the payroll taxes and taxes on the wealthy, there’s a proposed couple of trillion dollars in terms of taxes on the wealthy.
But right now I think the bigger issue for investors is the headwinds to the markets that might come from this much corporate taxation, and this could take a reasonable chunk out of after-tax earnings.  And so we’ll have to wait and see what gets passed and how it gets passed and when it gets passed.  But the biggest headwind here is from that.
So I see a positive outcome for growth and employment, but some headwinds on valuation.  Now some people might say well that’s fair because for the last 25 to 30 years, there’s essentially been an implicit wealth transfer from workers to owners of capital, and this would just be reversing some of that by reducing corporate valuations to transfer wealth back to median income workers.  And I think that’s explicitly part of what the Biden agenda is all about.  Everyone can make their judgments in terms of what that means for them.  But I think that’s the broad outline through which you should be looking at Biden’s agenda.
The other challenge for the equity markets is obviously the concentration, high valuations in the concentration in terms of the contribution from just a few large tech and social media stocks.  So there’s a bit of good news and bad news, and I’m going to try not to cherry pick any specific data point.  The profit margin news on the corporate sector is pretty good.  While profit margins obviously got whacked in Q2, they fell to a level that’s still basically the highest level seen in the last 50 years or so.  US companies are highly profitable and had the wherewithal, a lot of them anyway, to absorb the hit that came from COVID.
And so in other words, tech and pharma and biotech, some of these pre-tax margins were still 20 to 30%, and they were more than twice the margins of some of the cyclical and consumer staple companies.  The challenge is the PE ratio for the market overall, even if we look at it relative to 2021 earnings, which assumes a normalization of earnings back to 2019 levels, these valuations are pretty high.  And it’s hard to see how you could get a further valuation boost to market levels.  I think from here it would have to be earnings-based.
The top five stocks now represent the largest share of market cap since 1990.  It’s actually, I think it’s almost double the level that it was in 1999.  In other words, the contribution to the overall market from Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook is double what the top five firm contributions were in 1999.  Now there’s a big difference between now and then.  The free cash flow of the largest companies back in’ 99 was terrible.  It was like 8%, and now it’s closer to 20.  So these companies are more profitable.
But the valuations reflect that, and so it’s an expensive market where people have been crowding into the stocks that are seen as having the greatest degree of protection from mobility issues resulting from COVID, and it’s going to take a lot of earnings broadening next year to prevent frequent bouts of profit-taking and intermittent stock market corrections.  Right now we’re I guess you would say mildly optimistic on the outlook for a broadening earnings recovery.  A lot of it’s going to depend upon how quickly a vaccine is developed and how quickly it changes the behavior of the people that take it.
The other thing to keep in mind as well, when you look at a world where you’ve got the five largest stocks representing an all-time high in terms of contribution to the market and to employment and to GDP, you have to start thinking about antitrust policies.  There were two or three instances in the last 50 years when you had these antitrust concerns.  Obviously the end of the 1990’s was one of them.  The late 60s and the industrial concentrations was another one.
And now you’ve got this tech and social media concentration where as a percentage of the overall economy, it’s as high or higher than those two prior episodes, both of which led to some antitrust action by the Department of Justice.  And there’s obviously some politics involved, but the attorney general has overruled the Justice Department lawyers that wanted more time before bringing an antitrust case against Google.  And so a case might be filed as early as September or October of this year.
And to be clear, while there are some political shenanigans in terms of the timing of this, there is bipartisan interest in this Google case in all the 50 states, given Google’s control, I think 90% of global web searches and a third of all online advertising.  So we have to start factoring in some of these antitrust risks.  I don’t think that it’s flashing red as a risk quite yet.
It’s unclear if the Trump administration has interest in broadening the antitrust actions outside Google.  And if Biden’s elected, he’s expected to increase antitrust enforcement by the Sherman and Clayton Acts and things like that, and to improve bargaining power for the gig economy workers.  He’s also mentioned revoking part of the US Communications Act that gives safe harbor provisions to protect Facebook from crazy things people post there.
But Biden has called, he’s described calls to break up big tech firms as premature.  And so far his clearest antitrust statements are about farming, hospitals, insurance, and pharma, and not tech or social media.  I think Biden is more focused on protecting critical infrastructure from cybersecurity threats and things like that, and on restoring net neutrality.  And we’d be surprised if a Biden administration really curtailed the ability of the big tech firms to acquire competitors and startups or to force divestitures.
Okay, I know I’m running a little bit long this week, but there’s a lot to cover.  Let’s talk a little bit about COVID.  So I spent a lot of the summer obviously preparing our weekly COVID emails and maintaining the online virus portal that we have.
Here’s the good news.  In most of the developed world, mortality has collapsed relative to the rate of infection.  And there’s a lot of debate about this.  The most likely explanations are younger people are now getting infected, and obviously their mortality rates are much lower, so you have infections up, but mortality doesn’t go up.
You’ve got more selective ventilation of hospitalized patients.  I think ventilation was going on a lot more frequently in the beginning, and now they realize that there are alternatives to that.  Increased use of certain anticoagulants, blood thinners, and steroids, which have proven very effective ‘cause COVID is not just a pulmonary disease, it’s also a vascular one.  And don’t discount the fact that when hospitals, doctors, and nurses aren’t overwhelmed, mortality rates go down as well.
So that’s the good news.  And now this good news has ushered in I think a strong belief in certain places that the economy should be reopened as quickly as possible, and some people have brought to my attention some issues with COVID data, right.
So if you’re interested, here are some of the issues with COVID data, why it needs to be interpreted carefully.  These PCR tests that are used in many places to determine public policy and school closings and things like that, the results are highly dependent on how fine-tuned the equipment is to determine positivity.  So if you took a COVID test in one lab in your state, and you did the same exact test in another lab, you could get a positive and a negative, depending on how fine-tuned this equipment is.  And if all of the equipment nationally were calibrated similarly, the reported infection levels in certain places could fall by a lot.  And by a lot I mean 20, 30, 40, 50%.
So there are issues here in terms of how these PCR tests are used from a policy perspective.  And the reason for all of the debate is how much of a trace, how small a trace of RNA are you actually looking for?  And if you’re looking for any trace, including in people that had the infection and are no longer contagious, because you want to find it for contact tracing purposes, those very fine-tuned equipment will help.  If you’re trying to identify people that are currently contagious and should be isolated, having those fine-tuned equipment approaches is not going to help you.
So there’s also some reports of hospitalized individuals may be counted as COVID patients when they’re there for other reasons and things like that.  The bottom line is that the PCR tests, flawed as they are, are highly correlated with hospitalizations and really the only way at this point to easily monitor community spread, and I think people have to understand that.
If you want to read more detail on this issue, it’s on pages seven and eight of the Labor Day Eye on the Market.  We get into all the excess death issues and the cycle issues and the T-cell issues.  There’s way too much being written and said about T-cells at this point.  I agree there’s a lot of emotional, workplace, and economic stress associated with school closings, and I’m not arguing that they should remain remote.
In fact, I think that the country should be working as aggressively as possible to where expanded testing, contact tracing, and isolation can be used to spot and contain outbreaks, in which case you can reopen the schools.  But that’s for the public health officials to decide.  And I think the libertarian narrative about the virus takes liberties with the real-life complexity of this pandemic.  So anyway, more on that in the Labor Day Eye on the Market.
And then let me just summarize in closing, if anybody is still here.  The president and the attorney general have been making a lot of very derogatory comments about the mail-in voting process.  To be sure, the mail-in voting process is not riskless.  In 2016, about 4% of all those ballots were lost or miscounted.  This comes from an MIT study.  But that’s not that different from the amount of in-person votes that get lost or miscounted in regular presidential elections due to deficiencies in the election administration, inaccurate voter registration, malfunctioning machines, and things like that.
So there’s not a lot of evidence you can actually find that vote by-mail-ballots are nearly as destructive or inherently exposed to fraud to the degree that the president and his attorney general have been saying.
So anyway, but given the comments they’re making and concerns about the political process, if it takes a few days or weeks in some states after the election to finally count up the ballots and figure out who won in each state, I put together a description of the rules, dates, and process in presidential elections, and it’s at the end of the Eye on the Market.  The bottom line is the states have over a month to determine who the winners are in their state, right?  So the drop-dead date is December 8th.  That’s the Safe Harbor date.
And there’s also a process in the Constitution that defaults to Congressional election of the President if on January 6
th
, if the Electoral College doesn’t produce a candidate with at least 270 votes.  So there are all sorts of contingencies in the Constitution to handle weird outcomes.  And what’s notable is none of those contingencies involve the current president automatically by law remaining in place until things get sorted out.  So take a look if you’re interested in how contingent elections work, where the House and the Senate pick the president and vice president and if you really want to know the rules.
I strongly believe that even though there may be quite a few states that don’t know who won the day after the election, within two to three weeks, they will know after they count up all the mail-in ballots.  And the states have discretion about that process as long as they are adhering to the equal protection clause.  So I don’t really think as, they can stamp their feet up and down as much as they want, but I’m not sure there’s much the White House and the Justice Department would be able to do about the process.  So thank you very much for listening, and I look forward to speaking to you again soon.

MR. MICHAEL CEMBALEST
:  Good morning, everybody.  This is the mid-October Eye on the Market.  Just a few quick topics as we buckle ourselves up for the election.  The first page this week deals with the question of pre-election processing of absentee ballots.  And the reason that's important is if Biden wins Florida and Texas, you could have a winner announced on election night.  But if Trump holds those states, as he did last time, and it comes down to some of the Midwestern swing states, it could be a while before the winner is known.
And the reason is because a couple of important states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin share an unholy trinity.  One, they don't have experience with large numbers of absentee ballots.  Two, they don't allow any pre-election processing of absentee ballots.  And three, there swing states with large numbers of electoral votes at stake.   And both Ohio and Michigan are very similar in terms of rules that don't really allow a lot of substantial pre-election processing of these absentee ballots.
We get into a gruesome discussion here on the bottom of the first page on the process of counting absentee ballots and why it takes so much time.  But the bottom line is, trust me on this, it does take quite a bit of time to process this stuff.  And so far there have been over five million absentee ballots admitted nationally, compared to just 75,000 by this point in 2016.  So it may take a few days for a winner to be announced.
And there's a page here for anybody that wants to subject themselves to abject cruelty.  We have a chart here that shows a combination of absentee and mail-in voting experience in 2016, whether it's a swing state, the number of electoral votes, a code on absentee ballot processing rule, and another code on absentee ballot counting rule.  So if you're a glutton for electoral punishment, you can take a look at this chart.  But the bottom line is that Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania may be the source of some substantial election-related delays.
The next thing we discussed this week is a Rorschach test where you look at an inkblot and you see what does this mean to me?  We have a Rorschach test on COVID here.  There's a chart showing that the big sky states in the US, Idaho, Montana, the Dakotas, Wisconsin, Wyoming have infection rates that are ten times higher than the three Canadian provinces that are directly adjacent to them.  Their population densities are the same, generally the same; they're testing at roughly the same rate.  And it's an interesting exercise to think about why the infection rates are ten times higher and mortality rates six to seven times higher in the US, in these states than in the adjacent Canadian provinces, which is kind of remarkable.
The bottom line is the US is still dealing with some residual infections.  The level of mortality is obviously much lower than it was in the spring, but we're starting to see a trend where rising infections in young people who make up a larger component of recent infections are translating into rising infections in older people and rising mortality in older people.  It's already happening in Spain, again at a much lower level than it did in the spring, but there are some potential shoes to drop here as we go through the winter months.  The good news is places in Latin America, infections are now rolling over from very high levels.  And there's even some good news in Italy, which is not experiencing any kind of infection spike seen in the rest of Europe.
So let's talk more about politics and the election.  In recent Eye on the Market notes, we have this chart that shows, roughly speaking, a plan that raises, you know, 3 to $4 trillion in taxes on the wealthy and on the corporate sector from Biden's agenda and spending close to 8 trillion.  So the implication is that two things, number one, Biden's agenda involves a lot of stimulus for the US economy, because it's a big gap between 4 trillion in taxes and 8 trillion in spending, and also adds a lot more to the federal debt by the end of the decade.
Now, we've been focusing on this because of the rising market-implied probabilities of Democratic sweep.  Now, that said, we've now gotten some estimates of a second Trump term in terms of what that would do to spending and debt.  And the deficit impacts of both candidates' plans are not that different.  This is from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.  Now, I don't know how much of a second term Trump agenda would ever get passed because of the likelihood the Democrats retain the House.  But for the record, the Trump administration plan, which calls for lower taxes, more spending on military and infrastructure and space travel, lower drug prices, and reduced spending on immigrants, so that all translates into a lot of fiscal stimulus as well.
And so I think right now that's been well-received by the equity markets, that both candidates would keep those fiscal taps flowing.  And the markets also believe that there's a willingness by the Federal Reserve to keep a lid on interest rates if the debt markets ever revolted.  It is interesting to notice that rising Democratic sweep odds have not derailed the S&P's rise.  If anything, a brief decline in the odds of a Democratic sweep in early September actually coincided with a little bit of a setback in the market.
So one of the interesting things has been the tendency for the market this year to latch onto the deficit financing and stimulus proposals by the administration in a positive way and overlook some of the tailwinds, I'm sorry, headwinds associated with much higher levels of taxation.
There are a few other interesting trends that are being priced in as Democratic sweep projections rise.  One is a faster resumption of global trade and lower trade tensions with China.  And we can see this in the outperformance of stocks with exposure to those factors.  The mega cap tech and social media stocks have finally stopped outperforming the rest of the market.  This could reflect greater antitrust scrutiny from a Biden administration, as well as the beneficial impact of Biden spending plans on the laggard value sectors of the economy.
And then for everybody concerned that higher capital gains tax rates could result in a temporary market selloff as everybody runs for the hills to take advantage of lower rates, there's little evidence that that actually did happen in 1986 or 2012, when capital gains tax rates were increased.
Just a quick comment, some clients have asked about what's going to happen to the carried interest loophole that allows private equity sponsors to have their incentive fees treated as long-term capital gains?  The Biden administration doesn't need to have an explicit point of view on this loophole, because since they're planning on unifying capital gains at ordinary income rates at the same level for people with adjusted gross income over $1 million, the point is moot.  The carried interest loophole can be left in place, but the capital gains tax rates will be the same as the ordinary income ones.  So the Biden administration can sidestep the issue entirely through the approach they're using on unifying tax rates.
The last comment of the week is on vaccine timing.  A lot of public companies have benefitted from Federal Reserve programs on credit availability and cost.  Small and medium-sized businesses, particularly the virus-sensitive ones, are suffering from tighter credit conditions.  From various surveys, it looks like most of them can survive for another three to six months before experiencing severe cash flow shortfalls.
But at that point, there are some big questions to ask.  So the whole concept of timing of a vaccine is of critical importance for some of these virus-sensitive businesses, many of which our clients own, since that's what's really needed for normalizing consumer behaviors to pre-COVID levels.  So we get into some of the issues this week at the end on vaccine timing.
I'm going to skip for now some of the issues around how vaccine's not a foregone conclusion, and some of them may be approved with only 50 to 60% efficacy.  The bigger issues are the US ranks in the bottom third, the bottom of the third quartile globally, with respect to trust and in use of vaccines.  So even if a vaccine is approved, only roughly 27% of respondents in a recent poll said they would get the vaccine as soon as it's available.  Another 44% said they'd wait for a while, and the rest wouldn't get it at all.  And the problem with this is if you're part of the cohort upon whom the vaccine doesn't work, right, because as I said, the FDA would approve something with 60% efficacy, if you're part of the 40%, your chances of getting the disease are much higher if the overall adoption rates are low.
But the big issue here is a lot of vaccine companies took funding from Operation Warp Speed, and therefore the US government is going to own in the US and distribute a lot of the supplies.  And their prioritization is going to be healthcare workers first, and then 60 million essential service workers in food and agriculture, transportation, education, energy, wastewater, law enforcement, and then people with high-risk medical conditions, and then everybody else.
So what does this translate into?  My belief is that if a vaccine is approved by year end, the US is going to end up treating healthcare workers in Q1 of next year, and that most of the remaining populations will not be inoculated until Q3 of 2021.  And while the markets will probably price in the benefits of an approved vaccine upfront, the actual benefits in terms of economic activity and consumer behavior, returning to quote/unquote normal, is probably going to have to wait until true herd immunity is reached through a combination of antibody prevalence resulting from the disease survivors and the people that get vaccinated.
So anyway, that's the story.  We're all buckling up to prepare for a potentially sloppy few days following the election.  But the big picture is that the US economy appears to be doing okay with or without a second stimulus bill.  And we expect overall levels of economic activity to reach pre-COVID levels by the summer of last year.  So that's it for today, and we'll talk to you next time.

MR. MICHAEL CEMBALEST:
Good evening, everybody.  It's Sunday night, November 8th, and this is the election version of the Eye on the Market.  I haven't recorded a podcast in a while.
Like the rest of you, I've been kind of busy and also transfixed on what's been going on, so I want to just walk you through quickly where we are.
We've been sending a lot of information out, you know, on the market-wise in terms of what we think about the election.  And we had a piece last Friday on the, um -- the constitutional challenges that could be filed and some court history, um, and then an explanation of that an American Horror Story approach where state legislatures decide to send in competing slates of electors so the electoral college has two slates for the single state, et cetera.
So -- and those are all remote scenarios, but I thought it was important to at least spend some time walking through the logistics of them so that people understood.
Anyway, we have a piece coming out tomorrow called ""Quiet Flows the Don"" and, you know, I've been waiting to use that for a while.  I was a Russian Studies major in the 1980s and that's a 19th century epic novel about some Cossacks.  And it happens to fit here, uh, ""Quiet Flows the Don.""
When you look at the election from an investors' perspective, it does look like much more of a referendum on the president himself than on the policy issues that divide Democrats and Republicans.  I'll explain why in a minute.
First, and this chart you've seen from us a few times.  For the first time in 100 years a challenger has unseated an incumbent president at a time of strong economic and market tail ends.  And we have this chart that shows how we compute that, but it's pretty straightforward.  When you look at Hoover and you look at Bush Sr., and you look at Carter, uh, and you look at Ford.  Um, those are presidents that ran as incumbents during very weak periods both in terms of markets and economics.
Trump's tail runs were much higher and, uh, well, he's the first president -- he's the first incumbent president in a hundred years or so to lose, uh, at a time of strong tail ends.  And the last guy that did was Howard Taft who was so fat they had to bury him in a piano case, um, or so the rumor goes.
So -- so what Biden's accomplished is impressive simply, you know, if for no other reason than for the, uh -- the rarity that such an outcome actually happened.
But again when you look at the full scope of the federal and state results, and we don't know which way the Senate is going to go yet, but if we assume the Democrats and Republicans split those two open -- open runoff seats in Georgia, and some other assumptions on some unseated House seats, uh, this -- this is not -- this was not a clear referendum, uh, in terms of policies between Democrats and Republicans.
We put this chart together that looks at the history of the partisan balance in all of the federal and state government positions.  In other words, the House, the Senate, gubernatorial positions, and then the state legislatures, right?  The state Senates and the state Houses, sometimes called assemblies.
Forget about a blue wave.  According to this index we've put together, the Democratic tide actually went out a little bit.  The, uh -- the Democratic component of this index actually fell a little bit when you -- when you kind of keep track of all the different things that happened at the federal and the state level.
So that's pretty much telling us that we are in for a period of divided government, and the investor playbook that we need to come up with has to be geared towards that.
And, uh, now again, just to be clear, Democrats could pull off victories in Georgia and, um, they could decide to jettison the filibuster whose usage been rising pretty steadily over the last 50 years.  We have a chart on that in the 'Eye on the Market' coming out tomorrow.  So those things could happen.
You know, jettisoning the filibuster, when you've got a 50/50 split in the Senate and you're relying on the VP for a tiebreaker, would be a pretty bold thing to do.
Uh, um, in any case, since the summer of this year, the markets have been favoring a Biden portfolio that was betting on a blue wave, and it's been pummeling a Trump portfolio as well.  And so now, if we get divided government, the path forwards may benefit a purple mix of both this Biden and -- and Trump portfolio and we can kind of walk through the sectors that we feel strongest about.
I'll pick through a few of them here.  We're still -- regardless of the outcome, we're optimistic on -- on renewable energy.  There's probably not going to be a Green New Deal.
But the president, because of the powers invested in the executive branch, can still increase the cost of capital in oil and gas.  They can disallow further LNG export permits.  They can tighten fracking and methane rules, particularly on public lands.  They can increase climate risk disclosure requirements, reinstate the cap-phase standards which Trump softened in the Spring.
So there's a lot of things that Biden can do here and his people can do here to effectively increase the costs of capital for oil and gas relative to the cost in capital of additional renewable penetration of the grid.
So, um, you know, for what it's worth, I still think owning some renewable energy, particularly if it sells off here, would be -- would be interesting.
Infrastructure, if there's one point of agreement between both parties, it's the need to reinvest in some very dilapidated U.S. transportation and maritime infrastructure.  I think you could get a modest bill in 2021.  I don't know if it's a trillion dollars.  You know, we've been spending too many trillions of dollars this year, um, but I still think that's -- that's something interesting.
Where we're less optimistic is on the China trade war.  I think Biden's likely to go very slowly here.  I don't think he's going to remove these Trump tariffs during his first 18 months in office.
China is only 25 to 50 percent compliant with the Phase One trade deal purchases from the U.S.  And, um, whether it's for human rights reasons or mercantilism reason, the anti-China policies are now pretty bipartisan in Washington.
And now that we don't think we're going to get a big corporate tax hike, there are companies that benefitted from tax hikes in 2017 that -- that will continue to do so.  And, you know, we tracked those stocks.  They got hurt this year as people, uh, started to price in the probability of the corp -- the huge corporate tax hike.  That doesn't look like it's happening now.
And, um, with all the money that's being spent, we're -- despite the surge in Covid, still anticipating a decent global economic rebound in 2021 so companies with high levels of international sales should do well also.
We're not quite ready to embrace large cap pharma yet.  The, uh, the bipartisan prescription drug bill is possible.  And also the executive branch can implement demonstration projects that effectively bring Medicare Part D drug prices back down to international levels.
So, um, large cap pharma, in spite of all the fantastic work they're doing on the, on the vaccine trials, are, um -- are in the jailhouse in terms of public opinion, kind of just only ahead of banks maybe.
So -- and then we're neutral on the anti-trust targets.  I mean the worst -- the most punitive outcomes for the big four - Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Google - are probably off the table.  And if you want to see what those, uh -- what those worst case scenarios were or the House Judiciary report wanted to -- you know, all sorts of rules, merger prohibitions, breaking the big companies up, prohibitions on the use of bargaining power, and new anti-trust laws, forced data sharing; all sorts of stuff like that.  I don't think that -- that House Judiciary report is going to go anywhere on anti-trust.
Even so, there is still the Justice Department case that was just filed against Google.  Um, as we discussed in a piece a couple of weeks ago, um, based on the payments that Google makes to certain, uh, web browser developers and device manufacturers and, um, people like that, I -- I do think there is an interesting case there.  We'll see how it gets adjudicated in court.
And there could be a case pending versus Facebook as well, so we're kind of neutral on these anti-trust targets.  The worst outcomes for them are probably off the table, but there still could be some, um -- some difficult scenes that they'll be facing in 2021.
So, um, in general where do we go from here?  A client asked me to pull this table together on equity returns, whether there are Republican -- whether the president was Republican or Democrat, and whether or not they have control of Congress and, you know, which party had control of Congress and things like that.
The highest returns in the post-war era happened during grid lock periods when there was a Democratic president, but I don't think the table is worth very much.  The sample sizes are small and basically the return differences reflect mostly when recessions hurt and how the Fed happened to react to them.
So unless you think the presidents and Congress caused recessions, or they should get the benefit for narrating a recovery, um, most of those returns by party-affiliation, you know, charts, is garbage.
So let's focus on the business cycle.  Right now the U.S. and a lot of Europe are in a race against time.  The U.S. employment situation is definitely improving.  Um, only about half the increase -- the remaining increase of unemployment is permanent.  The other half is still temporary.
And, you know, we think we could be at 5 percent unemployment by the end of next year.  Uh, and -- and when you look at the number of unemployed people relative to job openings, this is -- it's much better than in prior recessions and it's a sign that when and if we get through this Covid thing, it could be a very strong and rapid recovery in employment and wages.
But, you know, the race against time is getting kind of short.  Covid infections, hospitalizations, deaths are rising again.  I am still sitting here in my undisclosed bunker with, uh, not allowing my kids to come out right now.  Um, you know, I'm taking the necessary precautions as a person who's 58 and has some co-morbidity issues.
And so what's going on here with Covid infections and hospitalizations and everything, this is increasing the chance of lockdowns which would really jeopardize the employment and spending recovery that we're seeing.
And it highlights the importance of three vaccine steps that are all different, critical hurdles on the road to herd immunity.  We need vaccine approval, we need vaccine distribution, and we need vaccine acceptance.
Those are three different things, but you need all three of them.  We talk about them extensively -- extensively on our webcasts and on the coronavirus web portal so I'm not going to do all that again here.
Um, I think given the election I'll close with the following.  You know, a greater adherence to scientific principles in Washington can only help on this vaccine acceptance issue.  And, uh, I think a decision by Trump not to fire Dr. Fauci, which he's threatened to do, could be helpful as well in terms of maintaining some level of acceptance for -- for science and for vaccines in particular.
The United States ranks in the bottom, uh, third globally with respect to vaccine adherence, belief, trust in science, and things like that.  So, um, if the world is going to get back to normal, it's gonna take a really long time to get there through herd immunity.
We saw some data a couple -- well, uh, last week from the CDC that by early August most states, other than New York and a couple of other northeastern states, were still below 5 percent in terms of antibody testing.  In other words, the serology tests they did showed that we are still a really long way away from herd immunity.
So we need vaccine approval, we need vaccine distribution, and we need vaccine acceptance.  And hopefully in something that's -- that's something that the new administration in D.C. will work on on promoting all three of those.
So thank you for listening and I look forward to speaking to you again next time.

MR. MICHAEL CEMBALEST:
Good afternoon everybody.  This is the Thanksgiving
Eye on the Market
Podcast.  Welcome.  So about a year ago I wrote a piece on the Armageddonists which are the market watchers, forecasters, money managers, all the people whose apocalyptically bearish comment tend to spread like wildfire in print and in the online financial news.  And as we looked at last year anybody following these Armageddonists over the last decade to the end of last year had large opportunity losses if they had been listening to them and were sheltering in low risk assets, given how well equity markets performed.
So the question is, now we’ll take a look at another Thanksgiving, did the COVID virus selloff rescue these Armageddonists by finally causing the market collapse they were anticipating and the answer is no.  Even if we give them credit for including pandemics in their panoply of disasters, the selloff last March didn’t erase the cumulative fund performance of the portfolios that we created that match up to their views.  And the selloff that took place last March was so quickly reversed that you would almost have had to rebalance immediately into riskier assets to even recover part of the prior losses.
So COVID didn’t rescue the Armageddonists from underperformance purgatory and now the markets are at all-time highs again.  And one of the things you can see, we have a little chart in this week’s piece, that plots a new batch of Armageddonists comments that were made in March and April, pretty close to the market bottom.  And we show you a little table of what those comments were.
Why have these Armageddonist-driven portfolios done so badly?  You know in fairness to them, monetary and fiscal stimulus explains a lot.  The problem is as investors you have to deal with the world that you live in rather than the world that you would like to see.  So there’s been a lot of fiscal and monetary stimulus, a lot of these Armageddonist types are either gold bugs or they follow the Mises Institute on very tight money.  And you know this disturbs them.
The last decade has seen the longest period of negative interest rates in recorded history other than during the three wars.  And more recently the COVID stimulus was two times the levels that was provided during the financial crisis and was delivered four times faster.  There are some other technical factors involved.  There’s been a shortage of investable publicly traded equities given all the buybacks and M&A activity.
And in fairness to the corporate sector, corporate profits have been much more resilient than these Armageddonists may have expected.  In Q3 earnings were expected at one point to be down 25%, they turned out only to be down 8%.  And almost the entire earnings contraction in the quarter was just from airlines, travel-related businesses and energy.
You know the free cash flow for the core of the market was actually up.  And so despite the latest surge in infections and mortality in the developed world which is a very scary thing, and obviously we’re tracking all these developments on our Coronavirus website, we anticipate a further recovery in spending, inventory building, capital investment, corporate profits, et cetera next year fueled by central banks buying another $3 trillion of assets and also by the eventual benefit of the vaccine and labor force participation and mobility.
So far we’ve had some good Phase 3 results from Pfizer and Moderna.  I would expect Novavax, J&J and Astra Zeneca to follow.  The one thing I would note that was a little puzzling was the infection rate that took place in the placebo groups in Pfizer and Moderna were only about half the overall level of infection in society.  So I still think the results are very meaningful but it was puzzling that the placebo groups had an infection level that was around half of the organic infection rate taking place around which suggests that maybe the vaccine candidate people did a little bit more social distancing than the average person even if they were placebo types.
In any case it’s very good news and there are CDC guidelines on who gets vaccinated when.  20 million healthcare workers in Q1, maybe another 30 million essential service workers, police, fire, water, electricity, wastewater handling, things like that in Q2.  And then the rest of the population starting in Q3.  So that’s what the rollout looks like.
One last virus note, Michigan now has 7 times more infections than it did in March and both hospitalizations, mortality are rising pretty sharply.  The response from radiologists and Trump Coronavirus advisor Scott Atlas to the renewed restrictions in Michigan was “the only way to stop this is if people rise up - you get what you accept”.  Only the best people we were promised.
Okay.  So with the latest news on the markets, it looks like the Armageddonists got this wrong again.  But I can think of one thing that could rescue them with a selloff and that would be the perception by the market that it’s an unorthodox transition of power as this election process unfolds.  And we go into some detail for anybody that’s really interested in how all the rules actually work at this end of this
Eye on the Market
, a couple of pages.
Let me make it clear ‘cause I’ve gotten some negative feedback on this, democracies can and should enforce the rule of law to make sure that only lawfully cast ballots are counted.  I agree with that 100%.  For investors and for financial markets the devil is in the detail of how this is achieved.  To what aims?  How is it done?  When is it done?  And do people play by the rules?
And the United States is the world’s reserve currency nation. If it’s seen as sliding down a path towards electoral illegitimacy that could have an impact.  We have a chart in this week’s piece showing - you know and this is a very generalized discussion - but the countries that have more constraints on government power tend to trade at higher valuations.  And so if the US rolls down the curve of perceived electoral legitimacy and rule of law, in the long run, you could end up in a derating of US equities.
So what are all the things that we get into here?  We discuss the issue about competing slates of electors.  Extremely rare, only happened one time in the 20th Century in Hawaii in 1960.
The bottom line is that a variety of entities whether it’s the legislature, governor, secretary of state, could conceivably submit a competing slate of electors to whatever slate of electors are certified by the state.  If they’re against the popular vote they could be invalid under some Federal Election Day statutes, they may violate the Voting Rights, the Supreme Court actually did recognize in
Bush V.  Gore
but the courts would sort all of that out at one point.
And then the real way that gets sorted out is through the Electoral Count Act.  It was passed in 1887 after 10 years of debate, after a pretty scary situation in 1876 where you almost had dueling inaugurations because the House and the Senate disagreed on who won.  And the Electoral Count Act in the case of a split Congress which we may have in terms of Democrats controlling the House, Republicans controlling the Senate.
The tiebreakers go to the governors.  And the governors in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Nevada are Democrats.  And in Georgia and Arizona, they’re Republicans.  So if the Electoral Count Act is respected, there’s a clear process in terms of how Congress would deal with competing slates through gubernatorial tiebreakers.
There was an article from a Harvard historian who usually focuses on U.S.-China relations that the Republicans could just dispense with the Electoral Count Act and proceed under the 12th Amendment which would give Vice President Pence as the presiding office in the joint session on January 6th the ability to cast the deciding vote.  This is a theoretical argument.
And in this nightmare scenario you know the Senate ignored the Electoral Count Act, they let Pence cast the deciding votes, they figure out a way to flip three states in favor of Trump.  The Democrats disagree.  They don’t participate in the January 6th session and you end up with the potential for dueling inaugurations on January 20th.  This is all highly unlikely.  But the purpose of today’s note is to discuss some of the issues involved.
Allison’s scenario assumes that the Senate Republicans just discard the Electoral Count Act.  And how many would it take to prevent them from doing that if two or more GOP Senators actually respect the Electoral Count Act then those gubernatorial tiebreakers would work because irrespective of the runoff elections, the Democrats would have at least 50 votes in the Senate and then the situation would play out as expected.
We also talked to in this week’s piece the risk of what the Attorney General might do in terms of seizing or impounding election records, recounts.  The bottom line is that a lot of very unorthodox things would have to happen for Trump to be reelected based on the uncertified vote results so far.  Trump would have to either reverse or impede the results in three states to prevent Biden from reaching 270 electoral votes so you we explain the math and how it works and how we got there.
How remote are these risks?  Most of the election law, constitutional election experts I’ve been talking to say they’re extremely low.  Essentially because of the high hurdle needed for the Republicans to prove or the Trump campaign specifically to prove sufficient levels of unlawful ballots in a state for either courts to set aside the outcome or for state legislatures to decide that they’re going to overrule what was reported as the popular vote.
So they don’t believe it could happen.  I’m not going to rule anything out.  The Trump campaign has been filing lawsuits to prevent state certification of results.  The RNC hasn’t signed on to many of these things but anything is possible.
I did notice that a senior Department of Justice official who’s been there for many, many years who oversees voting investigations stepped down from his seat after Attorney General Barr authorized US attorneys to start probing election fraud.  And he wrote an email to his clients that said that the new policy abrogates a 40-year old noninterference policy.  So there was some strange things going on in the Department of Justice and I am not going to rule anything out at this point.
We also discuss what steps the Supreme Court might take in terms of state challenges or challenges to the constitutionality of the Electoral Count Act.  The bottom line is that it’s extremely unlikely that all of these things come to pass, in particular since you need three states to flip, for Biden not to reach 270 electoral votes.  But that is the one scenario I can think of right now that would derail what looks like a pretty positive outlook for US equities over the next few months.
One last thing.  My brother-in-law has been sending me videos and links to internet news sources asserting all sorts of proof of widespread fraud from election hackers and cybersecurity malware.  He tends to do this kind of thing.  I spent a few hours of my life that I’ll never get back responding to him with sources that clearly refute a lot of these theories.  I’m not sure it’s going to have much of an impact on him.  But if you are going to be celebrating Thanksgiving either in person or remotely with family members, and you need to refute some of this whacky stuff, I have done the homework for you and I have a link at the end of this week’s
Eye on the Market
that you can use.
So please be safe everyone.  Please obey all the laws that exist at the federal level and at the state and local level.  And I look forward to speaking with all of you again soon.

MICHAEL CEMBALEST:  Greetings, everybody, and welcome to the 2021 Eye on the Market Outlook Podcast.  The outlook this year is titled the Hazmat Recovery.  In addition to continued monetary and fiscal stimulus, we’re going to be getting some vaccine airdrops this year, and as we discuss in the executive summary, by late summer, we expect the global economy to be back close to pre-COVID levels of activity, given the vaccination timelines that we see.  Most developed countries have vaccine capacity that they’ve contracted four that’s roughly 1 and a half to 2 times the size of their vulnerable populations, already by Q2, and then later in the year, being able to vaccinate the rest of the populations that choose to get one, so we think by April or May, we’ll start to see some substantial mitigation and sustained mitigation of the hospitalization and mortality surges that we’ve seen over the last couple of months.
China is already booming again, and other signals we’re seeing in terms of leading indicators, like the copper market, are pointing to much stronger global growth in 2021.  One of the key things to remember about pandemics is that historically, like natural disasters, they can generate deep recessions, but the recoveries tend to be much faster than ordinary recessions, and you can look at things like employment and production and consumer spending and capital spending, and we show some examples of how much faster the recoveries tend to be when pandemics and natural disasters occur, compared to typical recessions, and so we’re expecting US unemployment to end 2021 at about 5 percent, and one of the key messages here is that there’s an enormous amount of pent up unspent consumer spending that we think will be unleashed, and that the Fed won’t be doing very much to constrain it.
There’s a lot to talk about this year, there are some important issues that hinge on the Georgia Senate runoff outcomes, for example, if Democrats take both seats, there are some important decisions on budget reconciliation in the filibuster that will have enormous impacts on what Biden’s achievable agenda turns out to be.  In the executive summary, we talk about that in some detail, but in any case, the corporate sector has been pretty resilient to this pandemic.  For example, in Q3, S&P earnings were only down 8 percent or so, compared to the 25 percent that they were projected to be down, and the details are important.  Airlines, other travel-related businesses, and the energy sector accounted for almost the entire earnings contraction in the quarter, so in addition to seeing unemployment at about 5 percent at the end of next year, at the current pace of improvement, we also think the S&P 500 earnings per share should be back to pre-pandemic levels, maybe by Q3 or Q4 of 2021.
All of that said, it is hard to escape the pervasive impact of zero interest rates on the investment landscape.  We have a chart in here that we’ve shown you all before on how the last decade has seen the longest sustained period of negative real policy rates in recorded history, other than during the Civil War, World War 1, and World War 2, and so that has resulted in very high equity valuations compared to history, and a lot of money flowing into anything that has any kind of a yield, so we believe that the equity melt-up which took place at the end of 2020 will limit market gains in the US to roughly 10 percent in 2021.  The consensus is very bullish, which does set the stage for corrections and profit-taking from time to time.
In this piece, we do spend some time on the issue of market concentration and antitrust risk.  It’s impossible to ignore this issue.  Since 2016, five stocks, and you all know what they are, have represented a disproportionate share of market cap and total returns.  They’re a lot more profitable than their 1990s counterparts, but we’re concerned about some of the antitrust risks at home and digital service taxes abroad, and that’s one of the reasons that we’re a little bit more neutral on those stocks for 2021.  As an alternative to them, we review some of the secular, high-growth stocks that don’t have quite as much antitrust baggage, that look a lot more interesting.
It’s hard to wrap up the entire outlook in just a few minutes on these kinds of podcasts, but I’ll give it a shot.  It’ll probably take three to four months, as we said, for vaccinations to permanently shift developed world hospitalization mortality curves down, given the complicated logistics involved, and since the US is really nowhere near herd immunity.  I think the latest data from the CDC show that most states have antibody presence of 10 percent or less.
Even so, we do think that there’s an enormous amount of pent-up spending potential that’s going to be unleashed, and one of the key charts in the outlook here compares potential spending to actual consumption growth, and we’re now looking at one of the largest gaps in the last 50 years or so.  We don’t think the Fed is going to short-circuit this.  I think after a decade of being wrong about growth, inflation, and policy rates, the Fed is going to wait to see a four-alarm fire of inflation before they decide to ever raise rates again.
So, it looks like a year of roughly 10 percent equity market gains in the US, with bouts of profit-taking along the way, given how bullish the consensus is, and again, we’re going to have to see what happens with the runoff elections and decisions on budget reconciliation in the filibuster to understand really what Biden’s true agenda is going to be.
We spent some time this year on some special investment topics that I’d like to just walk through for a minute, given how important they are.  We take a close look at China, its trade and military conflicts with the US are at the highest level in years, at the same time that its weight in global equity and fixed income indices is set to rise, and so global diversified investors have to grapple with that, and we walk through some of the choices involved.  We also revisit the reasons for the consistent outperformance of US equities versus Europe and Japan, the impact of negative rates on European banks, and then for investors looking for value, we walk through some of the few sectors left in the US that haven’t recovered yet, and emerging markets, which we prefer to Europe, given what looks like favorable valuations, cheaper currencies, and much lower balance of payments risks.
As I mentioned, we do spend a lot of time on antitrust issues facing the US mega-cap stocks, as well as some of the digital service tax risks that those companies face overseas, and then for investors that are struggling with the impact of zero interest rates, we look at hybrid investments as a means of boosting returns, and when we talk about hybrid investments, we’re talking about certain kinds of structured credit, we’re talking about mortgage REITs, equity REITs, we’re talking about collateralized loan obligations, things like that, and that’s really kind of the last stop on the train in a rapidly shrinking set of portfolio choices for yield-oriented investors, and we conclude the special topic section with some discussions on the US debt, the increase in the federal debt is probably permanent, and what the implications for things like gold, so take a look at the outlook.
We’re also going to be having a webcast in early January that you’ll all be invited to participate, as we kind of walk through some of these things in a little bit more detail, and one last comment we provided in an extra supplement today, which is a--this was the email, it’s not on the landing page, it’s a two-page primer on the joint session of Congress on January 6
th
, which is shaping up to be one of the more contentious events in US presidential history over the last hundred years or so, so we thought it was a good idea for everybody to be able to understand the rules of engagement at this January 6
th
joint session of Congress, because a lot of what’s out there in the press is either incomplete or actually misleading, so thank you very much for being loyal listeners of the podcast and readers of the Eye on the Market, and I actually hope to be back on the road, both seeing clients and fishing, sometime in April or May, fingers crossed.  Thank you very much, everybody.

MR. MICHAEL CEMBALEST:  Good morning everybody.  This is the January 19th Eye On The Market podcast.  Three main topics today; I wanted to talk to you about a bunch of things that are flying.  Equity markets are flying, COVID is flying, and so are corporate reactions to the congressional objectors.  The note this week gets into the details of what's going on with the equity markets.  We've got a lot of fully invested market participants and a complete lack of risk aversion right now and I wanted to walk through some of the details on that.  COVID is flying in certain places around the world as the mutations increase while vaccination is rising at a much slower pace, and I also wanted to talk a little bit about the aftermath of the January 6th, Capitol Building riot, specifically the corporate PACs and the actions they’re taking with respect to the congressional objectors.
Let’s start with equities.  Since last April equity markets have been on a tear.  A lot of the indices, whether it’s the S&P, or the Nasdaq, emerging markets and then specifically alternative energy, semiconductors, consumer discretionary, a lot of these things have been rising at around a hundred percent on an annualized basis since last April.  We expect a rebound in growth and profits and employment this year, but I think investors should start getting a little wary of one directional markets, particularly given some of the uncertainties around COVID mutations and what that might mean.  Our view this year is for rising markets, but with some bouts of intense profit taking along the way, so I would keep some dry powder around.
In this week’s note, one of the things we look at is information from our prime brokerage partners in the investment bank.  In our outlook we talked about very high levels of optimism from individual investors and equity market mutual fund managers.  The prime brokerage covers hedge funds and there were some startling charts in here when you see how quickly the notional exposure and the gross notional exposure of the hedge fund industry has been rising much more quickly than the market itself.  There's been a massive short squeeze.  We have a chart in here that shows the stocks with the highest short interest that have just been soaring this year and also a complete collapse to the lowest level in, let’s say, 20 years or so in the put/call ratio, which is a way of measuring how risk averse investors are by looking at the number of defensive put options the people buy relative to bullish call options, and so the put/call ratio has collapsed.
When you put it together, a lot of market participants fully invested, soaring hedge fund exposures, a short squeeze, and a collapse in risk aversion, I think you have to start being a little bit careful and keeping some spare cash and liquidity aside in case there's a correction at some point.  Now, that said, even though stocks are flying there's still plenty of demand for long duration fixed income as well and one of the things we discuss in this week’s note is how there was a minor 20 basis point backup in yields at the long end that drew in a lot of interest from real money investors, in other words, everybody but the broker/dealers.
An exception to the soaring stocks everywhere you look are the mega cap stocks.  The longest section in our 2021 outlook dealt with the challenges that are facing these big stocks in the form of antitrust issues, rising corporate tax rates, new proposed taxes on low tax jurisdictions around the world from the Biden administration and the digital services taxes being imposed on them by other countries.  We started talking about a lot of these risks last summer and by Labor Day we concluded that the best days of mega cap performance outperforming the market was probably behind them.  That’s exactly what's been happening.
We’ve talked in the outlook about other secular growth stocks that are below the antitrust radar that we like better.  In any case, the events of the last two weeks are also part of what we worried about and like Icarus, some of these stocks have been flying too close to the sun and once you have companies that have enormous size and scope, ever since the early 1900s there has been a reaction by government and by citizens against these enormous concentrations of power.  That said, I’m not going to get into too much detail on the dispute between Amazon web services and Parlor and there's other places you can look for legal commentary about how that dispute may be resolved.
Just so that everybody understands, the challenges that these social media and webhosting companies face in providing a place for people to discuss their views, go pull up Amazon’s response to Parlor’s lawsuit on the internet,
Business Insider
has a copy, and look on Pages 4 and 5.  Amazon lists some of the things they found people saying on Parlor and I thought this was a pretty nightmarish reflection of the inner id of a lot of the internet users that happen to use those forums.  When you see the kinds of comments that were on that site, you can understand better some of the decisions that Twitter and other platforms took and web hosters took to exorcise themselves of some of those participants.
In any case, I think the best days of the mega cap performance are behind them and we have some tables in here that show how they stack up against the rest of the market and specifically the S&P market cap weighted index has begun to underperform finally, the equal weighted index after outperforming it for so many years in a row.
With respect to COVID right now, the outlook is all about the collision of two things; a good thing and a bad thing.  The bad thing is these new mutations and the good thing is the availability of vaccines to mitigate both the instance of COVID and its severity.  In a lot of the trials that took place, even the people that were deemed to not have had the vaccine work on them quote/unquote, none of those people died or were even hospitalized as far as we know, which means that these vaccines have the potential to mitigate severity of COVID even when people do get it.
We have some charts in here on where some of these new mutations that are taking place.  Even if the new mutations are not more pathogenic, which means deadly, when you get it, they still result in more deaths because if they’re more contagious you have more people getting infected, and then you have this same percentage of infected people dying which means the overall deaths numbers go up.  Will the vaccines work against the new mutations?  Against some of them, apparently yes, based on testing from Pfizer.  Against some of the other ones, we don’t know yet.  There are more mutations to test, one of which originated in South Africa, testing’s underway.  One of the benefits of the mRNA vaccines is that they can apparently be reprogrammed reasonably quickly in order to respond to new mutations, but we’re starting to see mutation breath that is different enough versus the original virus to raise questions about vaccine efficacy, whereas, a few months ago, the mutations were genetically more similar to the original virus itself.
We’ve got some charts in here that look at the pace of vaccination.  They’re plodding along for a lot of the procedural and personnel bottlenecks you read about, and also the reluctance on the part of certain people, including healthcare workers, to take it.  We’ll be talking about some of this with the CEO of Moderna on a webcast this Wednesday, so please dial in if you want to hear a little bit more from him about issues related to personnel bottlenecks, production levels, vaccination levels, and then what they think they can do about resistance and things like that.
One last comment on COVID, one of the most annoying internet fallacies that I see is that COVID deaths are rising but are simply offsetting other causes of death, and so you know, all these other diseases have gone away and so the overall picture is not so bad.  This is just one of the most misinformed idiotic things I’ve ever heard.  The data is really clear.  The CDC tracks deaths from all causes relative to normal levels and anybody with eyes and a brain can look at the chart that we have in the Eye On The Market this week to see that deaths from all causes have surged way above normal levels and the reason for that is COVID.
We've got some additional information this week on the actual fear of flying which is that airline spending is still pretty depressed at about 80% below last year’s level based on credit card spending trends and TSA data, but oil demand overall is rising sharply on the U.S. and elsewhere, and as per our energy paper last June, we outlined a lot of reasons why we expected a rebound in oil and gas demand and related stocks and service sector businesses.  The loss of capital discipline by investors was, in our opinion, rather than stranded asset risks and renewable energy penetration, the primary drivers of why the energy sector did so poorly and capital discipline has unsurprisingly returned after people lost tons of money and the oil sector is rising again, which is more or less what we laid out in our energy paper last June.
We also have a section in here that looks in detail at the reasons why European equities have underperformed in the U.S.  You should take a look.  It’s an interesting chart, because what it does is it breaks down the various different reasons why Europe is underperformed.  A small part of it is the outperformance of the dollar, and a small part of it are sector weight differences where the U.S. has a lot more tech weight and Europe has more financials, industrials, and consumer staples, but the single biggest factor is not currencies in sectors, but within each sector the outperformance of U.S. companies relative to their European counterparts, whether it’s tech, consumer discretionary financials, even within the sectors, U.S. companies are more profitable and have generated higher returns than their European counterparts, so take a look at that.
The last section in today’s note deals with some of the insurrection issues, and I know that a lot of you have been reading in a lot of places a lot of different things, and so I’m not going to repeat what other people have said.  I will say that when I saw what was happening on January 6th, I started thinking about that fly that landed on Mike Pence’s head during the vice-presidential debate, and I started thinking that fly was trying to warn him that Trump was going to betray him in the most Shakespearian manner possible.
Remember, Trump tweeted at 1 a.m. on January 6th, if Mike Pence comes through for us, we will win the presidency.  Pence did not have any, the poor guy had none of the powers ascribed to him by the president, even though under the most distorted and charitable readings of the Electoral Count Act in the 12th Amendment, we explained all of this in detail on a note that we sent to you on January 1st, but enough people believed it and I think a lot of what happened on January 6th was a function of people completely misunderstanding the powers that the vice president has at the joint session and what he chose to do or not do.
Anyway, here we are the day before the inauguration, and the topic I did want to talk about was a bunch of U.S. companies have announced that they are not going to make any more political donations ever to members of congress that objected on January 6th to the Electoral College results.  First, to understand corporate PACs, we have some charts in here that show that all PACs represent somewhere between 20 and 40% of funding for politicians in the house and the senate, the rest coming from self-financing, small individual contributors, and large individual contributors, so PACs overall represent 20 to 40%.  Then within all PACs, corporate PACs are about two-thirds, the rest of them are ideological PACs like the Sierra Club or something like that, and then labor PACs.  All things considered corporate PACs represent 15 to 20% of a lot of politicians in the house and the senate of their funding, so changes to those patterns are material, but not life-threatening, I think is the right way to describe it.
What do I think about the decision to no longer give PAC funding to congressional objectors?  To be clear, this is just my opinion, and it doesn’t play a role in anything except my opinion.  But I think you have to think about it in two ways.  What are the arguments in favor of cutting off donations?  It’s very difficult to find good faith reasons for the objections that took place.  There were not competing slates of electors on the floor.  Some were submitted reportedly to the national archives, but Pence chose not to put them in front of congress.  There were no competing slates of electors on the floor.  Five of six of the disputed states are controlled by GOP legislatures, and none of them officially submitted a competing slate, and then after dozens of court cases, no judge or group of judges ruled that any of the Biden slate should be in any way discounted or decertified.  If you look at it from that perspective, the January 6th objections were attempts to disenfranchise voters with no good reason, and so that’s the reason that some corporate PACs have decided to cut off funding for politicians who objected in the lack of any good faith evidence for doing so.
Here’s the other side.  Irrespective of their reasoning, the congressional objectors were adhering and following rights ascribed to them in the Electoral Count Act.  The bill was passed in 1887 for the purpose of avoiding more violent and disruptive means of resolving these disputes, and so if you punish objectors who use legal means, whether you like it or not, you may be creating incentives for people to channel their objections into illegal means next time around.  As you may have read, democratic house reps raised objections in 2004, in 2000, and in 2016, and whatever their motives were, I don’t think those objections should have been sanctioned at the time either.
Here’s how the process should work from the other perspective.  Objectors should state their reasons for doing so and the supporters of the officially certified slates should say those objections such as those raised by Hawley and Cruz are cynical, unsupported, and baseless, and here is all of our data, court opinions, and legal precedent for saying that, and that’s how politics is supposed to work.  With those arguments in favor of cutting off donations and against them, my own personal opinion is I would not have cut off funding to congressional objectors solely based on their one decision on January 6th, because, as I mentioned, they were exercising rights ascribed to them in the Electoral Count Act in the 12th Amendment.  I would align the corporate PACs with politicians who share their firms values over a wide range of visions over a longer period of time.  That’s my opinion.  For whatever, it’s worth, which is probably nothing.
That is our Eye On The Market podcast for this week.  By the way, the title of this Eye On The Market is Fear of Flying because there's lots of flying references in this week’s note.  If you remember, that was a book written by Erica Jong in the early 1970s, and while it might seem a little tawdry, like a predecessor of the
Fifty Shades of Grey
books, at the time John Updike and Henry Miller and the
New York Times Book
Review reviewed it quite favorably.  I was 11 at the time it came out and so I did not actually read it.  Anyway, thank you all for listening, and I look forward to talking to you again soon.

SPAC capital raising boom
.  Our main focus: returns to date for SPAC sponsors and investors, and the large wealth transfers taking place among SPAC participants.  Second topic:
Biden’s early stage energy policies
(ban on new oil & gas leases on Federal lands, Keystone XL pipeline termination and conversion of Federal fleet to EVs) will probably end up increasing US oil & gas imports more than they reduce emissions.
Read more here.MICHEAL CEMBALEST:
Good Afternoon, everybody. This is the early February “Eye on The Market” podcast. This Eye on the Market this week is called “Hydraulic Spacking” because we want to talk about two things. First, the capital raising boom using the SPAC vehicles, and secondly, the reference of hydraulic fracking.
I want to take an early look at some of Biden’s energy policies which so far don’t seem to be in sync because they’re mostly about reducing oil and gas supply and not reducing oil and gas demand, in which case all you get is a rise in oil imports and no real change in emissions.
Anyway, let’s look at this SPAC boom. It’s pretty remarkable. Just to make it simple, a ‘SPAC’ is an alternative way for a private company to go public. Instead of doing a traditional IPO, a ‘SPAC’ is established through an IPO.
There are some sponsors. They hold the proceeds in cash and they have a couple of years to hunt around for a private company that they take public. And then there’s a snowflake-like array of different rules, regulations, disclosure, etc., in terms of how this all works.
The bottom line is that you’ve got a blind pool SPAC. Tons of them have been formed. Around 85 have completed their mergers and brought new companies public. There’s another 300 or so that haven’t completed the process or even found a merger partner yet. And we wanted to take a look at the results so far even though there’s way more SPACs to be completed than the ones that have been completed so far.
The bottom line is that some people are making a lot of money here because there are some wealth transfers and they’re large from some SPAC participants to others. SPACs might be a cheaper way for companies to raise money. We’ll talk about that.
And then my biggest concern is that the SPAC boom may simply end up bringing a lot of earlier stage, lower quality companies to market, and that might be the more lasting legacy of this whole thing. And, you know, every 15 minutes you’re reading about another celebrity that’s raising a SPAC, so I think that does tell you something.
Anyway, so in--on the first page of the piece we have a diagram here. Our piece is not a SPAC primer. You should look elsewhere if you want to see that. There’s plenty of law firms and investment banks that have published detailed SPAC primers, and if you’re going to invest in them you should probably read one of them just so that you know what all the rules are.
Instead, we wanted to focus on the performance and some of the basics that you need to know. So what are some of the basics? The SPAC market kind of revived what was a moribund new issue market in the U.S. and have been around half of all new IPOs by volume and number of deals over the last couple of years.
A lot of them are technology, electric vehicle, and health care companies so there’s a big growth bias there. And they tend to be pretty early-stage and unprofitable of--you know, way around three-quarters, maybe more, of all of the SPACs brought public so far were, you know, had negative free cash flow in their most recent financial statements.
Now, that’s not unique to SPACs. The IPO market last year, 80 percent of those IPOs had negative earnings as well, so risk tolerance for unproven business models is just very high right now. It’s what happens in an environment of low interest rates.
And we’ve actually built this thing called a “YUC model” where “YUC” stands for young unprofitable company. And we showed in 2019 how the share of new high-growth but unprofitable companies as a percentage of market cap had been rising to the highest level since 2000. We’ve updated the chart and it’s still rising and that, you know, obviously the SPACs are part of that.
And so anyway, read the piece if you want to see more about the rules. The bottom line is that there are four major SPAC participants. You know, five if you include the SPAC sponsor, right?
So the SPAC sponsor sets it up. Then you’ve got a group of investors that participate in the SPAC IPO itself. At that point they hunt around for a company. They find one. They sign a Letter of Intent and then they start--typically most of them are going to start talking to institutional money managers to arrange a private placement so they can close the merger.
And in case those up-front SPAC investors decide to redeem for cash, which is their right to do that, you’ve got the institutional money standing by to help you complete the merger and also to do larger deals. And then eventually you have the final retail investors who end up owning the new public company once the merger is complete.
So we went through each one and we computed the returns for the different SPAC investor types that we’ve identified. And we compare--we looked at the returns on an absolute basis and relative to other things people could have bought, such as traditional IPOs and the Russell 2000 Growth Index.
And what you tend to see is a real divergence. So first you’ve got the original investors in the SPAC and they do great. And I have to say, these are some of the most remarkable investments I’ve ever seen because you can sell in the secondary market before the merger if shares go up, or get your cash back if the SPAC prices decline.
So it’s kind of a very low-risk optionality for your money. And then you also get warrants in the new company that you can keep even if you redeem for cash.
In my experience, every time you see one investor class making tons of money relative to the risks that they are taking, that’s because other classes of investors and the issuers are paying for it, right? There’s no free lunch here.
So in my opinion what we have happening here is wealth transfers from all of the other participants in this SPAC universe and from the selling companies to juice up those returns of the original SPAC investor.
So we have a table here that compares all the different returns. For the up-front SPAC investors, who we call the SPAC garb investors, the returns look great. For all the other investors, the SPAC buy-and-hold investor, the pipe investor, the institutional money, the retail holder, the absolute returns have been great, but the relative returns relative to any IPO index they could have bought or the Russell 2000 Growth Index, most of those numbers, those median numbers are negative.
So, you know, and you have to remember in a rising market, rising tides lift all boats. So you’ve gotta take a closer look at the assumptions we’ve made and what we’re saying, but I think a lot of people feel great about the SPACs right now because they’ve made money in them.
If the people who are the buy-and-hold investors took a look at what they bought instead, they might see that they might have made even more money.
So, you know, we’ve got a lot more information here. We take a look at the question of whether or not SPACs are in fact a cheaper means of raising capital for companies going public. The early evidence suggests that they might be which is why the selling companies might be willing to give the SPAC sponsors such a big piece of the deal. Some of them get as much as 20 percent of the shares in the SPAC.
And then we’ve got a whole bunch of charts here that show you the growth in the SPACs and the sectors, redemption rates, and the low level of profitability of the companies that have been brought public so far.
So, yeah, take a look. The bottom line is that this looks like a vehicle for bringing new companies public that will stick around. But after this surge in SPAC activity fades and we get a chance to sit back and look at the actual performance of the companies that are brought public, I wouldn’t be surprised to see if a lot of them under-performed, other investments one could have made in traditional IPOs, and in the broad markets.
The second half of the Eye on The Market this week look at Biden’s early energy agenda. And there’s undoubtedly going to be more to come from the Biden administration. I mean they’ve barely had a month on the job.
That said, just like we looked at a preliminary basis on the SPAC market, let’s take a preliminary real world impact look at Biden’s early energy policies, and so far a lot of the policies are going to reduce oil and gas supply a lot faster than they reduce oil and gas demands.
And what you end up with in that case is a--just a modest rise in exports--I’m sorry, of U.S. oil and gas imports rather than any change in emissions. So let’s take a look just for a second.
The first major policy was a ban on new permits for oil and gas production on federal lands. So this doesn’t cancel any existing leases. It just means that as the existing wells become non-productive and get shuttered, they won’t be replaced.
That’s going to have a bigger impact on onshore production sooner than offshore because the life cycle of the onshore hydraulically fracked wells is, let’s say, 12 to 18 months where the offshore wells can, you know, can last for years if not decades.
So up front I think the impact is fairly small. Onshore production of oil and gas only accounts for around nine percent of total U.S. oil and gas domestic production. That said, if this moratorium were to stay in place forever, the larger amounts produced in offshore federal lands would add to the decline in production.
I think the more important point is what I said earlier. If you shut down oil and gas demand on U.S. federal lands and it’s not met by increased production on U.S. private lands, the gap simply is going to be imported unless you can enact policies that reduce oil and gas consumption just as quickly. And that we’re really not seeing yet.
Kind of a similar situation with the Keystone Pipeline termination. If you take 500,000 barrels a day of oil that were going to be exported by Canada to the U.S. and use standard refining conversions, you’d get about 3.5 billion gallons of gasoline a year that would have come to the U.S. from Canada.
Now if the U.S. were adopting electric vehicles at a sufficiently rapid pace, you wouldn’t care about this pipeline disappearing, and the emissions gains would be immediate but that’s not what’s happening.
If you make some basic assumptions about passenger cars, 3.5 billion gallons of gasoline every year would power almost 6,000,000 internal combustion engine cars. Last year only around 330,000 electric vehicles were sold in the U.S. So based on the current pace of electric vehicle sales, it would take 17 years to offset the loss of the Keystone Pipeline. In the meantime, the U.S. will simply be importing the oil that would have come from Canada from someplace else.
Now, the current pace of vehicle sales, I hope, will start rising more rapidly than it has been. A lot of the auto companies are announcing new models and, you know, and we’ll see what happens.
But EV sales in the U.S. have kind of been flat-ish for the last couple of years. Let’s see whether or not the Biden administration can do things to make those go up faster.
Here’s one thing to think about. In addition to the lost gasoline supply from the Keystone cancellation, you’ve also got around $2.5 billion of distillate fuels and 800,000,000 gallons of jet fuel that we won’t be getting which are, you know, the other components of refining crude oil.
And so those are other fuels that will need to either be produced domestically or imported from some other place other than Canada. And imagine the irony if Biden’s Keystone policy just ended up benefitting Middle East oil exporters and hurting Canada which is America’s, arguably, closest ally that has been reliably selling its oil and gas and hydroelectric and uranium supplies to the United States for decades.
Now, there was one policy we saw of the Biden upfront policies, and again there’s more to come, that does reduce oil and gas demand and that was the electric--the electrification, you know, EVs for the federal government agency fleet of vehicles.
The challenge here is that it’s only about 600,000 cars and immediately electrifying them would reduce U.S. gasoline demand by about 400,000,000 gallons a year. That’s a very, very small number compared to the 5.5 billion gallons a year that you lose from eliminating Keystone XL and eliminating onshore oil production on federal lands.
So, again, just to beat a dead horse here, the federal electric vehicle--the vehicle electrification policy reduces demand by a small amount and is dwarfed by the policies that reduce supply. And all you’re going to end up with is a lot more imports at some point, not a big change in emissions, unless you get some policies that reduce demand.
Now maybe those will come next. And at the end of the Eye on The Market this week we talk through what some of those would have to be. You would certainly have to increase the pace of investment and production tax credits for wind and solar power. You’re going to need, you know, either hundreds of billions, or trillions depending upon whose numbers you believe, to invest in transmission for increased wind and solar power and avoid curtailed renewable energy and remain--and maintain power reliability.
And something we’ve been writing about in the Eye on The Market energy paper for years: the federal government may need to exercise its imminent domain rights to prevent local politics and NIMBY activists from killing projects that are going to make this all work.
There was a Clean Line Plains and Eastern project to bring wind power from Oklahoma to the east coast. Arkansas killed it. There was--the most ridiculous example was the progressive enclave of New Hampshire killed a hydro-electric project from Quebec to the Northeast that’s simply going to result in more combustion of natural gas. And they did that because they thought the transmission lines would be a blight on tourism.
So I don’t know how you get to real demand reduction and displacement of fossil fuels if critical infrastructure and renewable energy projects can be killed by states like this. You know, and you--certainly Biden will probably reinstate the auto mileage standards revoked by Trump.
And so we walk through some of those things, but, you know, it’s very easy for a new administration to come in and do things to reduce supply. Reducing demand is another question entirely and this is something that we’re going to track as we evaluate and understand the Biden energy agenda.
Okay. That’s enough for this week. And thank you for listening and we’ll talk to you again soon.

MR. MICHAEL CEMBALEST:
Good morning, this is the Eye on the Market holiday version of the podcast.  At this time of the year, I send something out that's a little bit more personal to clients.  And if you don't like this kind of thing or are easily offended by certain things, please stop listening to this podcast immediately and listen to something else.  Otherwise, listen, keep going.
So the title of the holiday piece is called The Winter of Our Discontent.  You might be able to guess about some of what I wrote about today.  That passage from Richard the III is about a harsh winter that's coming to an end, and now the good things are on the way.  The actual passage is, ""Now is the winter of our discontent, made glorious summer by the sun of York.""  And it's about the fact that this terrible season is ending and something good is coming.  And I think that's true.  A lot of hospital systems in the United States are overwhelmed, and COVID deaths are elevated right now.  But the vaccine trials suggest that better days are coming.
A COVID vaccine was never a foregone conclusion here.  There's no AIDS vaccine still.  And a lot of traditional vaccines that use dead and attenuated viruses take years to develop.  And then the MRNA and vector vaccine approaches that Pfizer, Moderna, and AstraZeneca have come up with have never been approved for use before in the developed world.  So the fact that it looks like they work is kind of remarkable.
A few months ago, in March when Mary and I did a webcast, I said that the world could be 70 to 80% back to normal a year later.  And my rationale was based on two things, the rapid pace of medical advances that were culminating and global efforts to defeat the virus, and also markets were pricing in at five, seven, ten-year drawn-out economic recovery.  That's the kind of thing that usually follows a war.  And so we thought the recovery would be faster with lots of monetary and fiscal stimulus, and also since pandemics are more closely related to national disasters than economic depressions.
We have a table in here that looks at a bunch of economic indicators for the US.  Most of them are at least 60% recovered from, in terms of the percentage of the decline.  It's now been recovered, whether it's certain kinds of employment, production, spending, housing, retail sales, capital goods shipments, things like that.  And some of them are 70% recovered, and some of them are fully recovered.  So our forecast for the spring of 2021 is still on track.  And again, as I mentioned, there are some very overcrowded hospital systems that are kind of terrifying, and we have charts in here to show which ones they are.
That said, it's very hard to escape this winter of our discontent.  Many of you are now aware of what's going on.  There have been allegations of election fraud.  There's been pressure from Congress and the executive branch on state legislators to submit uncertified slates of electors to the Electoral College.  Bunches of legislators are supporting this approach.  You had the lawsuit from the attorney general of Texas suing four other states for failing to conduct safe and secure elections.  And then 20 states and at least 120 GOP House reps filed amicus briefs or actually sought to become co-plaintiffs.  We've had calls from General Flynn and others for martial law, suspension of habeas corpus, and military tribunals.  There have been physical threats against election and appointed officials.  And then also counter-allegations of voter suppression, given what happened with the postal service, voter purges, drop box rules.  So this has been a difficult period here.
The judiciary has been pretty clear so far that the Trump campaign lawyers have lost 30 to 40 lawsuits depending on how you count them.  There's 10 or 15 still pending and either zero or one clear wins.  Even with those judgements from the judiciary being so clear, I think it would be interesting if an objective policy shop or an academic team itemized a lot of the fraud and legal process allegations and provided a list of explanations for laypeople.  I think that would be helpful.  We've just had an election where we've had a bunch of states going from 5 or 8% absentee ballot shares to 25%, 40%, even 60% in the case of Michigan.  And you have highly gerrymandered and polarized voting districts that can lead to some weird lumpy outcomes.
And I think there's a lot of interesting work that academics and other policy people that follow this kind of thing can explain so that the rest of us can understand the basis for a lot of these fraud allegations and why they either do or don't make sense.  And I think this would be helpful, particularly if this is how future elections will take place with very high absentee ballot shares.  Certainly Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin should join the rest of the states and allow absentee ballots to be processed well before Election Day, and I think it's a fair question to ask why they haven't done that.
To be clear, there have been very few documented instances of voter fraud.  There's a Brennan Center for Justice that has A Myth of Voter Fraud website.  And they've got a bunch of academic analyses and judicial decisions from 2000 to 2017 on all sorts of voter impersonation, list matching, list maintenance issues.  And they found .0025% instances of voter fraud.  And even the Heritage Foundation, which has a lot of history on commentary, only cites about 1,300 cases of voter fraud in its database, which begins in the year 2000, of all the elections they've covered since then.
But what Brennan and Heritage analyzed are a little bit different from the ballot handling and data dump allegations in this year's election.  And so I still think it would be interesting for, as I mentioned, some policy shops and some academics to take a look at what happened, if only to allay the concerns of such large blocks of the population that don't trust the results.
Now for people that are concerned about election fraud, remember this.  In February of 2020, Senate Republicans blocked three bills on election security, including election security funding, and a proposal to ban the voting machines from being connected to the Internet, which is one of the issues that's actually been cited by certain people as why they believe that there may have been certain instances of malfeasance this year.
In any case, to add some lightheartedness to what's otherwise a pretty dour holiday piece, I noted in the piece how I fed some information on voter data news stories and Twitter feeds into our neural network model and showed what it came out with.  You'll have to look at the exhibit.  All I will say on this podcast is that there's a picture of Hugo Chavez, Michelangelo's statue of David, the octopus from my octopus teacher, a minion, and Mr. Crabs from Sponge Bob.  You'll have to take a look.
And for everybody that looks at it, do me a favor.  Please don't get all upset; this is obviously satire.  I believe that a good postmortem on this election would make sense.  And I'd also like the Supreme Court to clarify what state legislators can and can't do regarding election law changes.  That's the essence of what the attorney general of Ohio did last week.  He filed an amicus brief where he angered everybody, which I thought was a pretty courageous thing to do, since he denied that Texas had standing to sue the other states for election handling, but also supported the need for some kind of judicial clarification on election law changes.
In any case, all the states have now certified their results.  And the next step is the January 6th joint session of Congress, in which the electoral votes get counted.  Is there a chance that Trump remains president, even though today is the Electoral College admission deadline?  Yes, technically, but it would take a really bizarre series of highly unlikely events.  And if you want to understand the gory details, you'll just have to look on the appendix on page seven of today's piece, because it requires a detailed understanding of the Electoral Count Act, which was passed in 1887, and which is the process by which Congress has to sort out the issues of completing slates or challenges to the official slates of electors.  This is not an issue for the courts to determine.  This is an issue for Congress, and the Electoral Count Act, which was passed over 100 years ago, explains how that will take place.
I do think that the courts may eventually grant some victories to the Trump campaign on extensions that were mandated by courts instead of state legislatures and on some equal protection issues in places like Wisconsin, where there may have been selective application in different counties of ballot curing and ID requirements.  But I don't think, and I haven't found anybody else that believes that even if the courts are going to find in favor of the Trump lawyers, that they're not going to provide the requested remedies, which is either reallocating or decertifying the electors in those states.
One of my favorite shows as a kid was The Bob Newhart Show.  And I have always liked politicians that remind me of Bob Newhart.  Unfortunately, politicians like that are pretty rare and may become rarer if there's a GOP purge of politicians who were not supportive of the Texas lawsuit.  And in many states, that appears to be what's happening.
I conclude the piece today with some observations.  You've got to see some of these charts to believe them.  The share of Congressional moderates has plummeted.  And as this has happened, growth rates in the United States have declined.  And there's a lot of reasons that growth rates have declined.  A lot of it's demographics and longevity.  But I believe that the growth rates have declined as well with the decline of Congressional moderates because you get these violent swings in both directions, in terms of all sorts of policy issues that prevent the country and specifically businesses and CEOs from making long-term plans on anything related to trade, energy, net neutrality, and things like that, that keep getting punted back and forth, immigration.
A growing percentage of people in both parties see the other side as immoral, not just wrong, but immoral.  And for the first time ever, more people vote based on antipathy for the opposing party than based on support for their own party.  And we're actually at the stage here where you've got people who support the elimination of the Electoral College entirely in favor of a popular vote.  Now of course, Constitutional amendments are going to make that very, very difficult to happen.
But that state, it would reflect the aggregate national preference but disenfranchise a lot of the states that for example, produce the food and energy that allow giant urban centers to exist in the first place.  And even more immediately, important as it relates to what may happen from the runoffs in Georgia, you've got a lot of people that are pushing Schumer as potentially the Senate majority leader if the Democrats win both seats to eliminate the Senate filibuster, which has been around since the early 1800s.
That would give President Biden the chance to preside over a unified government, with one of the narrowest Congressional majorities ever, essentially 51/50 in the Senate, using the VP as a tiebreaker, and eight to ten seats in the House.
If they eliminate the filibuster to pass major legislation that would impact the country for decades without any consent or support from the opposing party, it would continue a very disturbing trend.  And we have a chart in here on how over the last hundred years, major 20th century legislation almost always had some kind of bipartisan support, civil rights, immigration, war powers, deregulation, labor issues, trade expansion, the Patriot Act, the most controversial bills had substantial levels of bipartisan support.  And that era ended with the hyper-partisan passage of the recovery bill in 2009, the Affordable Care Act, Dodd-Frank, and then Trump's tax cuts, which was the single most partisan major bill in history.
So all I can tell you is if moderate politicians keep losing elections, and voters like us or like me, let's say, have to increasingly pick between the two extremes, I'm not happy about it, but I know which choice I'm going to make.  Anyway, I hope to see many of you in 2021.  Our Eye on the Market 2021 outlook is going to be released as usual on January 1st.  And I hope that all of you have a safe and happy holiday season.

MR. MICHAEL CEMBALEST:
Good evening everybody and welcome to the March 2021 Eye on the Market podcast.  There are three topics I want to be discussing today: interest rates and equities, the Zoom shock on commercial and residential real estate and a COVID update.
Also please join us on Thursday, this Thursday, we're going to have a webcast to discuss our SPAC research and the returns for all the different categories of investors.
So on the rate issue, if interest rates stay at or below 2% I think that's a great sign for equity investors and everybody would probably agree.  Where there's disagreement is if interest rates don’t stay below 2% it's amazing to see the pretzels that people contort themselves into to convince themselves that rising rates aren't a problem for equities.
There's a ton of rationalizations that we walk through each with its own picture of a little pretzel in today's Eye on the Market.  And it's amazing because this whole drumbeat of if rates rise, don't worry about equities from all the research people, I see it's kind of a cause for concern 'cause nobody wants to confront the possibility that there's a disconnect between Fed policy and the long bond and equity valuations.
We thought this year we'd get 10% returns or so on U.S.  Large Cap stocks, assuming a big surge in consumer and business activity, widespread vaccinations, minimal disruption from vaccine resistant variants, another $2 trillion in fiscal stimulus for COVID and an infrastructure oriented bill in the fall, only part of which is offset by increased taxes on wealthy individuals and companies, a collapse in unemployment to around 4.5% by the end of the year, and then combining that with all sorts of investor euphoria  as sky high valuations for everything growth related, things like that and small increases in interest rates and inflation.
So if rates stay at or below 2%, you know that view or that 10% return view is still in place.  If rates hit 2.5% or higher, I would be much less optimistic in contrast to almost all the other research I see where people are talking about the reasons why they wouldn't worry about the rising--the impact of rising interest rates on equities.
The primary concern I would have is over the last few years we've had a surge in the price that investors pay for growth stocks.  And you can look at that by just looking at the PE multiples relative to revenue growth.  They are as high or if not higher, that ratio, than we had in 2000.  And this has coincided with a period of not just low interest rates but low expectations for future rate increases.  And you can look at something called the Term Premium from the New York Fed to track that.
The Term Premium is finally increasing as now, all of a sudden, there is more uncertainty about future rates and inflation and so I think this extreme price that people are paying for growth is going to come down a bit and so that's a headwind in a rising rate environment that I think some people are overlooking.  We'll see.
We'll know how it goes over the next few months.  Our estimate is that vaccinations plus non-vaccinated COVID survivors, right, so in other words two different source of antibody protection, is headed to around 70% by late May, right when over $1 trillion of the new $1.9 trillion in stimulus hits the economy: direct checks, small business aid, state and local aid.  That much stimulus could eliminate a big chunk of the spare capacity that's lying around.  And so we've talked about this before and we have some charts here on the output gap and some of the things that Larry Sommers has been saying.
It's interesting because the Fed has been wrong about rising inflation over almost the whole last decade.  They thought it was going to up and they were wrong.  Now they've gotten religion and they're betting the house on red which is that any revival in inflation is temporary and they're not worried about it.  So I'm not sure the long bond is going to agree with them for that long.  And so we'll see.
Now in a rising rate environment, there are some sectors that are doing pretty well: financials, right, obviously, steeper yield curves help banks' net operating income.  We're having a big global post-COVID recovery in industrial production which is helping industrials and basic materials.  And then the energy sector is doing well which is in part a COVID recovery story.
But I think even bigger is the story about industry consolidation and renewed management focus on free cash flow.  We made a bullish call on oil and gas in our energy paper last June around the lows in oil and gas stocks 'cause we thought that the sector's problems which for a decade you could see were related more to the shale supply shock and management decisions to ignore profitability.
If you actually look at the price, 2010 to 2019, there was negative free cash flow in the entire shale industry.  And about 20 or 30 companies, almost none of them, had even a couple of years of positive free cash flow.  That's now changing and that's what's been helping the stocks since last June.  And we're sticking with this call.  Our energy paper comes out, by the way, in mid-May this year where we'll talk about that and a bunch of other topics.
The bottom line is that, again, as long as rates stay at 2% or below everything should be fine but I'm less optimistic that a rising rate environment can coincide with decent returns on large cap stocks.  We'll see.
Now.  I want to take an early look at the Zoom shock on U.S. and residential commercial real estate.  A year ago I wrote that the U.S. would be 70-80% back to normal in a year.  So that year is now.  So if you look at energy consumption, capacity utilization, industrial production, consumer spending, housing starts, capital goods shipments, all of these things have recovered by at least 70-80% if not having now exceeded 2019 levels.
The one thing that I don't think is going to normalize that quickly is the number of people working from home compared to pre-COVID levels.  I'm simplifying here but the average employee in the U.S. would prefer to work from home half the week.  There's a distribution of expectations and desires but the average white collar employee would like to work from home 2.5 days a week whereas employers are kind of anywhere between .5 and 1 day.  So there's a big bid offer between what employees want and what employers want.
If the compromise ends up someplace in the middle there's going to be something of a Zoom shock for office owners.  There's some really interesting research that's been done on this Zoom shock to commercial real estate.  And it refers to the fact that people aren't switching jobs.  They still spend the same amount of money, almost everything about their lives stay the same, they just work from home instead.
And the people who study this are now looking by geographical area at the Zoom shock and we showed one of the maps for Greater London and you can see the intensity of the employment domicile inflow and outflow that tends to take place.  And again it's not people losing and gaining jobs, it's just where they do the jobs but obviously that has a huge impact on residential, commercial real estate valuations.
One of the charts in here shows the amazing correlation between an estimate of how many jobs can be done from home, by zip code, and what the residential property prices changes were from over the last year.  This is one of the most linear fits of a regression I've ever seen.
In addition cities where a lot of jobs can be done from home tend to have larger declines in commercial real estate valuations 'cause those denser cities are subject to Zoom shocks as well.  And we have to start thinking about this kind of thing because the implications not just for home prices but for office rents, valuations, sublet volumes, the solvency and ridership of public transit systems, municipalities in terms of bond risks, the tax base, and tax rates and a whole range of businesses tied to office utilization rates in urban centers.
We have an early look so far.  We show 10 large cities and the office utilization rates.  Now there are some places like New York and San Francisco and Chicago where office utilization rates are still only 15-20% and we know that 'cause we have data on key card and fob data of office employees.
But even in Dallas and Houston and Austin where public transit is almost nonexistent, I mean the Census Bureau tracks that kind of thing, and the percentage of workers who commute by public transport in Dallas, Austin, and Houston is less than 5%.  And yet those office utilization rates are only around 35%.
So here we are in an environment where people in those places can commute and reduce their COVID risks and the office utilization rates are still only about a third.  And so it suggest that this battle between employers and employees on work from home is still underway and today's piece just gets into some of the potential implications of that.
So let's finish up with some COVID discussion.  The COVID statistics continue to improve in the U.S.  The pace of vaccination has picked up a lot in the last couple of weeks.  And we have a chart that looks at partial vaccinations, full vaccinations, it's in today's Eye on the Market and you can see this pace has picked up a lot.  And again you know mid-May we could be looking at 50% vaccination plus 20% non-vaccinated survivors.
It's possible the U.S., and this is what we're on track, it's possible the U.S. will win the race against time here because if you vaccinate quickly enough, you can run ahead of these more contagious and more deadly new variants.  This U.K. B-117 variant is only around 10% in the U.S.  And the South African and Brazil variants are present here but at less than .5% of new infections.
So if the U.S. continues to vaccinate aggressively, we can win this race against time on these new variants.  And you can see Continental Europe is not winning that race.  They're losing that race and they're paying a price for the squabbles they had with Astra-Zeneca and Oxford and with not diversifying their vaccine purchases more broadly and for some of the issues that took place in terms of questioning the efficacy of the Astra-Zeneca vaccine.
The U.K. variant is now spreading more rapidly in France, Italy, and The Netherlands.  More than 50% of new infections and vaccinations are still only around 5-8%.  So Italy had to shut down again in preparation for Easter holidays whereas the U.K., the data continued to decline as vaccinations hit 35% which is many multiples higher.  And even though that U.K. variant is all over the U.K. the vaccination rates are running ahead of it and you're still seeing declines in the U.K. in hospitalizations, mortality, and infection.
So this is really turning out to be a battle between vaccination and variants.  The U.S. is in much better shape that Europe.
Brazil's COVID situation is worth noting.  It accounts for all of the worsening in Latin America since of most of the other countries in the region are actually improving.  There's this very creepy mortality spike in the Amazon in Manaus.  That was a place where it was believed that the herd mentality, or sorry, herd immunity had already been reached and so it was surprised to see a huge surge in mortality in the Amazon over the last couple of months.  It's now rolling over but has spread to Minas Gerais, Sao Paulo, and Rio and Bahia and some of the other larger states.
So Brazil is the worst combination where you have extremely low vaccination rates and rapidly spreading, dangerous variants.  This gets to a very interesting discussion that I was reading about the other day where the WHO and other international aid organizations are lobbying the U.S. aggressively which may end the month of June with a surplus of unused vaccines, lobbying them to share those with certain emerging economies 'cause as long as large emerging nations like Brazil are having these kinds of problems it's going to be difficult for the world to get back to normal.  So far the Biden Administration hasn't taken a firm position on what they're going to do here.  And it'll be interesting to watch this play out if we end up with a huge vaccine divide between the developed and the emerging world.
So that's it for today's piece.  Thank you for listening.  Again, please join us on Thursday for our SPAC call.  Bye.

MICHAEL CEMBALEST:
Good morning everybody.  This is the mid-February Eye on the Market Podcast.  A lot of topics I wanted to cover briefly this week, all in the form of little short stories.  The global economic rebound is in full swing right now.  If you look at shipping demand and petroleum consumption and manufacturing and capital spending, they're all rising pretty sharply.  Earnings in the fourth quarter actually were higher for the S&P than last year which is not something a lot of people were forecasting a few months ago.  And that's despite negative earnings for energy, airlines, hotels and restaurants.
As vaccinations rise, we should have some more good economic news to come.  What could rock the boat here? The two top ones for me are a bond market revolt and some vaccines unresponsive to COVID variants.  Those are my two guesses.  So we cover those, too, and other topics in the short stories.
Let me start with COVID.  Infections are plummeting really rapidly in the US and Europe.  And it's kind of remarkable because at the same time that's happening this B-117 U.K.  Variant which is more contagious and perhaps more deadly has been spreading.  It's now responsible for about 90% of infections in the UK, 20% in Denmark, only 6% in the US but some of our virus science contacts expect it to be the dominant strain in the US by March and the primary strain outstanding in May.
But in spite of this rising variant, infections have been plummeting.  So how can this be explained?  Well it's not easy.  And I don't think anybody has all the answers.  Vaccination rates in the US are only around 5% when infections started tumbling in mid-January so while some of the super spreaders were immunized, I don't think you can explain a 70% collapse in infections with 5% vaccinations.
The rise and fall in infections maybe was also driven in part by the rise and then fall in air and vehicle travel around the holidays but the increases were kind of small and we illustrate them.  There has also been a little bit of a decline in reported testing but all things considered these three factors don't explain the 70% collapse in infections.
My science advisory group can't really explain this either.  And that's okay.  I prefer that to people that spew all sorts of theories that they can't substantiate.  With infections down 70% from peak levels and vaccination is rising, like a lot of other people I expect hospitalization and mortality to continue to improve as well.  Hospitalizations are down half from peak levels and mortality is down around 15% from peak levels.
The good news is that the approved and pending vaccines look like they provide almost the same efficacy versus this UK B-117 strain as they do against the older incumbent strain.  The news isn't as good versus the South Africa strain which is now around 5% of all infections in Europe so part of this drama still has to play out in terms of how these infections spread.  I think epidemiologically the more successful a mutation is at infecting people the more it's going to infect people.  So if you look at Section 3 on our web portal we have a giant table that shows all the different vaccines against the different strains.
But the bottom line is really two things here.  Number one: all of the usual suspects don't really explain the magnitude of the infection decline, you know, but that's okay.  And the second thing is it's premature to declare mission accomplished with some of these new strains still spreading around.
In terms of Europe I saw some mission accomplished type commentary within JPMorgan and also outside it on the declines in infections and mortality in the UK and Denmark.  Everyone's entitled to their opinion but for anybody to write that and not mention the fact that infections and mortality are down there because of much more stringent lockdown provisions, that's not something I would take very seriously.
So the real test for Europe is whether it can sustain a decline in infections when lockdowns get lifted.  It's going to be very hard to keep lockdowns in place until all the variants -- until vaccinations rise to very high levels.  When European vaccination rates are mostly outside the UK, only 5% of the population.  So it's good to see the collapse in these infections but in Europe there's even more reason to doubt their durability because of the rise in these lockdown provisions and reductions in mobility.
One last thing on COVID.  A client sent me a report on the risk of facial paralysis and other side effects from COVID vaccines which does happen.  There's a German federal government agency that shows a .02% probability of that happening.  The studies I've seen on the risks of getting COVID and being one of those people who is affected months later by vascular, pulmonary and neurological problems is much higher than .02%.  So as soon as I'm eligible I plan to get the vaccine.
The next big and important topic this week is the stimulus bill, inflation, bond yields.  So Larry Summers wrote a piece on February 4th in the
Washington Post
that basically said the labor market is healing rapidly, there's a lot of pent up savings that are going to get deployed as soon as we reach herd immunity and another mega-stimulus bill tacked onto the largest deficits in the post-war era could reignite inflation.  The Fed's not prepared for that.  The bond markets aren't prepared for that.  Inflation has been left for dead and the markets are pricing in the Fed on hold for several years.
Now the Fed Chair says he's going to have tolerance for a temporarily period of above trend inflation.  He thinks that some of the stimulus programs will shrink.  Some economists don't believe that the amount of spare capacity is properly measured.  They think there's even more spare capacity than the typical measures you get from the Congressional Budget Office.  And if so, you don't have to worry about inflation.
I think it's pretty tough to estimate wonky things like output gaps and fiscal multipliers given the unprecedented kind of stimulus programs that are going on today.  And so I think Larry is probably onto something here.  I don't think it happens immediately but I do think the Fed's going to face some very difficult decisions well before the midterm elections.
Look, bond yields have already doubled from very low levels from about 60 basis points on the 10-year to 1.2%.  And with markets pricing in the Fed doing nothing, if you do get some normal levels of inflation, not even above -- way about trend but let's say 2.5 or 2.75% wage and price inflation, you know that's going to be an issue.  And if we get to 3.5% on 10-year Treasuries very quickly I think that could be a journey that involves some pretty substantial equity and credit market corrections.
So I think there are reasons to be a little careful here and watch how this plays out and how big this stimulus bill is going to be.  So we've got some charts in here that show you output gaps and how to measure spare capacity and what stimulus bills might do and when herd immunity might kick in and how pent up spending might be unleashed.  So I think Larry's more right than wrong on this one.  And I think there's too much -- there is too much calm and quiescence about some of these inflation risks.
Another short story this week is on the SPACs.  We did a really deep dive on this last week and I'm not going to revisit that.  I just wanted to provide some additional color on something.  The SPAC sponsors themselves, the people that create them, can make a lot of money here since they typically receive around 25% of all the SPAC IPO shares which typically is a lot of money compared to their upfront expenses which are $2-3 million of upfront structuring costs and underwriting fees on the SPAC itself.
So the thing I wanted to follow up on was there are a headful of SPACs that do a better deal, a better job, aligning the sponsor interests with the interest of the long-term buy and hold investors.  While many of the SPACs involve some kind of sponsor risk sharing, only a handful apply long-term vesting schedules that don't release the sponsored shares unless certain price targets are met, 1, 2, 3, 4 years later.  And this week we show some charts, kind of amazing, showing how buy and hold investors can lose a lot of money when sponsors don't lose any money and how buy and hold investors can be flat and sponsors are earning extremely large returns.
So these multi-year investing schedules for sponsors would solve part of this problem.  They're only present in a small minority of the 300 or so SPACs that are still looking to find a company to bring public.  But I think it's a sign of where the SPAC market will end up in a couple of years after people look back on the results of this latest wave.
Another little short story here is on the Texas power outage.  Just be careful.  Don't take the bait and blame the frozen wind turbines.  Yes, some of them are frozen.  But wind power was only expected to provide around 6 gigawatts of power to Texas in wintertime.  The peak energy demand during the storm was 67 gigawatts and 30 gigawatts of thermal power was off line.  And thermal power essentially is a term that refers to -- typically refers to coal and natural gas.  And in the case of Texas most of the 30 gigawatts of power that were offline were natural gas plants.
Why did this happen?  Well Texas has a lot less natural gas storage than other states.  They usually rely on Just in Time production from the Permian Basin to meet demand.  Texans and then the storm hits, Texas production of natural gas fell in half from normal levels on Monday because the gathering lines were frozen and the pumps to pump out the natural gas rely on electricity and the electric pumps failed.
You can winterize natural gas production and natural gas electricity generation facilities.  There are plants in Northern Canada that are not far from Nunavik that operate in average temperatures that are below zero every single winter.  The Texas ERCOT system hasn't made all those investments yet which is where the policy discussion will probably go from here.
On another energy topic, I did want to mention there's a lot of expectations on the Biden Administration to accelerate the renewable energy transition.  But there's a couple of things happening that will indicate how hard this is going to be to do.
So take Hydro Quebec.  It want to sell hydro power from its existing facilities to the US because they've got extra.  A state like New York can strike its own deal.  They share a border with Canada.  And New York is planning a fairly large transmission line buried under Lake Champlain to bring hydro power to New York City.
But the whole renewable energy transition is going to be delayed if the only time projects can really get done easily is when states control the whole transmission network.  And that's what killed Norther Pass which was a transmission line to bring hydro power from Quebec to the Northeast through New Hampshire, mostly through right of ways or underground.  But New Hampshire killed it.
And just to think about what that means: Canadian hydro power displaces natural gas and the IPC estimates that hydro power emissions over the entire lifetime of the construction and operation are 5% of natural gas lifetime emissions.  So there's clear climate benefits from this.  And Northern Pass could have reduced Northeastern emissions by 3 million metric tons of CO2 a year.
But tiny New Hampshire, primarily due to concerns about tourism and property values, killed it, which we wrote here gives new meaning to the New Hampshire State Motto: Live free or die.  Because while they're benefiting from hydro power and nuclear in their own state, they're impeding greater emissions-free generation in neighboring states.
And you know Massachusetts is trying again now after years and lots of money spent on Northern Pass failing.  They're trying again.  This time through Maine and they've run into another injunction based on local opposition.
And do you know the MIT published a report last year saying that the ideal solution is four gigawatts of new two-way transmission lines between New England and Quebec.  That's essentially four Northern Pass projects.  Good luck with that.
So I think part of what will be interesting to see is whether the Biden Administration uses eminent domain which is a power of the Federal government to try to get these states to cooperate with each other and maybe compensate each other better to provide the incentives.  Because if the only way these cross-border projects are going to happen -- I'm sorry.  If the only way these projects are going to happen is when states control the entire transmission network themselves, this energy transition is going to take a very, very long time.
The last short story this week, and I know I'm running long, but I hope you are still finding this interesting, the last little short story this week is on this not so civil war that’s brewing within the Republican Party.  Some Trump supporters have taken steps to launch a new Patriot Party and at the same time over 100 former GOP officials and Bush and Reagan Administration appointees met to discuss the creation of their own new center right party.  In other words people on both sides within the Republican Party appear to want a divorce.
The polls show that Americans say they're prepared for a third party but political splintering is a really big gamble.  And the more likely outcome are intense primary battles within the GOP that determines the future of the party.
When is the last time that a splintering was successful in terms of generating a new party that had national relevance?  It was in the 1850's.  There was a party called the Whigs.  There were big disputes within the party about slavery.  The Northern antislavery Whigs joined with smaller parties and disgruntled Democrats to form what's known today as the Republican Party.
And then some of the pro-slavery Southern Whigs joined the Democratic Party.  And then the Whig Party collapsed.  And we have an interesting chart in here that shows the percentage of Congressional members by party in the 1800's so you can see how this all evolved by election year.
So the question is is the successful creation of the Republican Party in the 1850's a template for either the Trump or anti-Trump faction within the GOP today I don't think so.  It took an enormous galvanizing force which was opposition to slavery to create this new party because it attracted the Whigs, it attracted some of the minority parties at the time, and it also attracted large defections from the Democratic Party that existed at the time.
Today a center, a new center right party, from anti-Trumpers might attract some centrist Democrats that are uncomfortable with the progressive wing of the Democratic Party but unless those defections are massive, this party probably wouldn't have a lot of national relevance because it would end up splitting the GOP vote.
Think about Teddy Roosevelt.  He left the GOP.  He was president and then became a private citizen again, was unhappy with President Taft and left the GOP to form the Progressive Party.  And ended up splitting the GOP vote almost right down the middle in 1912 with incumbent President Taft and that's how Woodrow Wilson, a Democrat, became president despite winning only 40% of the popular vote.
So this Trump/McConnell dispute is probably unprecedented, right, in terms of how raucous and vicious you’ve got this back and forth between an ex-president and the former Senate Majority Leader of his own party.  And there's a couple of historical parallels in the 20th Century where stuff like this happened but at the end of the day in the past the fences were mended and third party movements weren't launched.
I think this time I don't think the fences will be mended but I think the third parties are just as unlikely.  The censure votes of Republicans that supported impeachment suggests that the primary challenges are coming from the Trump wing of the party and that's what's going to determine the party's future rather than people leaving to form third parties within either faction.
So thank you very much for listening and stay safe and I look forward to talking to you all again soon.

RECORDED VOICE:
This podcast has been prepared exclusively for institutional, wholesale professional clients, and qualified investors only as defined by local laws and regulations.  Please read other important information which can be found on the link at the end of the podcast episode.
MR. MICHAEL CEMBALEST:
Good morning everyone and welcome to the mid-April Eye on the Market podcast.  Three topics this week, I want to just give you a general sense for our overall market views, we’re going to talk about the value recovery, and then we’re going to talk at the end about COVID herd immunity, a path to normalcy, and rising concerns about some of the blood clot risks from vector vaccines.
So first topic that we discussed is how unusual this cycle is with respect to how fiscal stimulus sits alongside private sector activity.  In the prior three or four cycles, the government steps in with fiscal stimulus when private sector demand is weak and then starts pulling the stimulus back as private sector demand recovers.  This time’s different.  This time, private sector demand is recovering sharply at the same time that the government’s got the pedal on the metal with respect to fiscal stimulus.  So this is somewhat unusual to have these things moving in the same direction.
This policy to go for growth is definitely getting traction in the equity markets.  Over the last five months, global equity funds have seen around $570 billion of inflows, which is more than the past 12 years combined, which is kind of amazing.  The S&P is up 11% already this year, mostly driven by surging value stocks, which we’ll talk about.  I can imagine a slow grind higher in the months ahead.  The biggest risk is for me, another rise in inflation expectations.
And some of what we look at here is there is a whole bunch of coincident leading indicators that are at or close to all-time highs.  When you look at home sales, spending potential of consumers, business inventories, global manufacturing and service sector surveys, job openings, Chinese shipping activity, there is a massive global boom underway, obviously the result of pent-up demand from the pandemic.  And ordinarily this kind of a rebound would be a very powerful signal for stocks.  This time it’s partially offset, not totally, but partially offset a little bit by rising inflation expectations.  We’re going to have some rising input costs from higher wages and raw material prices and also rising corporate taxes, which we discussed last time.
So the net impact of all of these positives and negatives is I can imagine the market grinding a little bit higher in the months ahead.  There was recently a rollover in some of the most cyclical, low quality, and small cap names, which is another sign that some of these good omens are partially priced in already.
The second topic, I’m not going to go through too much detail in this podcast, but the second topic is we take a look at the value rally.  There’s two very, very different ways to look at value stocks.  One is how do value stocks do versus growth stocks, and the answer there has generally been terrible.  But then there’s another way to look at it, which is really important in the money management industry, which is how is value as an investment factor doing?  And there the story is much better.  So in other words, if you are picking from among sectors, so you’re picking healthcare or tech or financials or real estate or consumer discretionary, how are you doing if you’re using value metrics like price to book and price to cash flow as a stock picking tool within each one of those sectors?  And there the news is better.
So we walk through a whole bunch of charts; a lot of investors are interested in these topics.  The bottom line is that value has trailed growth on an absolute basis, mostly because growth stocks have been surging rather than value stocks necessarily underperforming.  Value multiples have actually been rising in recent years.  It’s just that the growth multiples went up more.  And with respect to value as a stock selection tool, there the news is much better.  And we kind of show that with the exception of 2018 and 2019, value as a stock picking tool has worked pretty consistently since the mid to late 1990s.  So you can take a look at that, and we get into that discussion as well.
So let’s talk about COVID for a little bit.  Let’s start with the bad news, although I think everybody kind of understands this.  It’s unlikely that textbook herd immunity is going to happen.  Textbook herd immunity is called sterilizing herd immunity, where you effectively eliminate community spread through both vaccination and prior exposure.  This time around, I don’t think we’re going to get there.  The hesitancy of certain people to get vaccinated, the constant emergence of new variants, reduced vaccine efficacy, particularly with respect to the South Africa and Brazil variants, delayed vaccinations of children and other younger individuals, very low vaccination rates in emerging countries, a lot of whom are adjacent to developed market countries, and an uncertainty on how long vaccination protection lasts and whether you can spread it symptomatically even after you’re vaccinated, all of these things combined, I think textbook community, herd immunity is going to be difficult to reach.  It looks like COVID’s going to become an endemic disease like the flu and will have to be treated accordingly.
Now, the good news is you can still have a return to normalcy as long as prior exposure plus vaccinations can drive infections and hospitalization and mortality down sufficiently on a sustained basis.  And I think we can get there.  We’re looking for signs of what total seroprevalence levels are needed.  And seroprevalence is a term that refers to non-vaccinated individuals who were exposed and got sick and everybody that was vaccinated.  And so we have a bunch of charts where we’re starting to track these things.  And we put vaccinations on the X-axis, and then we look at infections, hospitalization, mortality on the Y-axis to see how far out on the vaccination axis do you need to go before some of these other COVID metrics collapse.  And Israel is really the only place where it looks like it’s happening on a sustained basis across the board, and it looks like zero prevalence levels.  They are somewhere between 65 and 70%, which is more or less what Fauci and other people at the CDC have been saying from the beginning.
Now you can still, and it’s notable that in a whole bunch of places, whether we’re talking about Chile or Minnesota or Michigan or Uruguay, we’re seeing places where at 30 to 35% vaccination rates, plus another 5 to 10% of the population that is unvaccinated but was exposed before, you’re still having rising infections.  So for anybody that thought that you could achieve some kind of herd immunity below 50% or below 40% seroprevalence, that doesn’t seem to be the case.  That said, there are some meaningful declines in mortality and hospitalization that have occurred at 30 to 40% vaccination rates.  And so it’s a mixed bag.  It doesn’t seem like you get herd immunity at those levels, but you do get substantial declines.  Now at what level do you get kind of a full reopening with no restrictions, unclear.  But we’re starting to track these things and this information, and these charts appear in the Eye on the Market today.
And then just a few last comments on what’s happened with J&J.  As a reminder, the only vaccines that have been approved so far in the developed world are genetic vaccines.  You’ve got Pfizer and Moderna; those are the messenger RNA vaccines.  And then you’ve got J&J and AstraZeneca, which are the Trojan horse vector vaccines.  And I call them Trojan horse vaccines because they use some unrelated virus, in one example, a chimp virus, to deliver the generic instructions to the body’s cells to actually fight COVID.
And it now looks like the vector vaccines are resulting in some adverse events in very rare circumstances.  The rate so far, I think, is one out of 170 million in Europe and one in a million in the US.  That said, these adverse events are pretty severe.  People are getting different kinds of thrombosis.  There’s two of them we discuss today.  These kind of things can lead to pulmonary embolisms.  In one study, 11 patients in Europe had some of these events and six of them died.  And the technical name that the scientists are now talking about here is vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia.
So the European health authorities more broadly as well as the WHO have concluded that okay, the benefits outweigh the risks, given the risks of COVID for older people, so people over 60 or 55 should still get it.  People younger shouldn’t.  Some countries have halted vaccinations altogether, like Norway.  So now we’ve got in the U.S. a pause because of the six cases of thrombosis that occurred out of six million doses so far.  Our best guess is that like Europe, eventually J&J will be unpaused, and there will be an age restriction where only people over let’s say 60 will get it.
J&J has not been hugely important.  It’s only 1 or 2% of the 35% of the U.S. population that’s been uniquely vaccinated so far.  And I think the production schedules for Pfizer and Moderna will be sufficient to meet whatever demand exists in the developing world this summer.  As a matter of fact, in the U.S., we think that declining demand is going to be an issue before the J&J availability issues become a constraint.
So the bigger issue is what does this latest development do to vaccine hesitancy, and there it’s impossible to say.  Obviously going to track it, and we’re tracking all of these vaccine numbers very closely.  The more of an impact this has on vaccine hesitancy, the more the risk that the community spread will be sustained, and from time to time, there will be some kind of outbreak.  But broadly speaking, our 50% of population vaccination timelines for the US, the UK, Canada, Europe, Australia, Japan are broadly unchanged, mostly because the Pfizer and Moderna production schedules were supposed to provide the bulk of vaccination coverage for the summer anyway.  And an adverse event in the, in the messenger RNA vaccines would be of much greater consequence for the developed world than issues with these vector vaccines.  So anyway, take a look.  Good to talk to you again, and you will next hear from me in early May with the annual Eye on the Market energy paper.  Thank you very much for listening, bye.

[Music Playing]
MR. MICHAEL CEMBALEST:  Good morning, and welcome to the Eye on the Market energy podcast.  For the last 11 years, we’ve written a paper that takes a deep dive into the energy and climate issues that we think are most important to understand.
This year the paper is called Future Shock, and the reason is because without some kind of decarbonization shock treatment, we’re all going to be wedded to petroleum and other fossil fuels for longer than we’d all like.  The wind and solar power capacity additions around the world are accelerating.  They still represent just five percent of global primary energy consumption.
So in this year’s paper, we review why decarbonization is taking as long as it is, and we--and we take a very close look at four issues: the obstacles with respect to transmission, industrial energy use which is primarily fossil fuels difficult to electrify, the gargantuan requirements in terms of both mineralization and pipeline demands of sequestration, and the slow-motion revolution in electric vehicles.
Other topics include our oil and gas views, President Biden’s energy agenda, and then specifically how much natural gas will the U.S. need in the future in light of President Biden’s goal to decarbonize the electricity grid by 2035.
We take a look at--a close look at Chinese energy use, some last words on the Texas power outage, and then we also answer some client questions on things like electrified shipping, sustainable aviation fuels, low-energy nuclear power, the hydrogen economy, and then some new carbon accounting approaches from MSCI.
It’s a pretty in-depth piece.  One of the reasons why we get into some detail is that a lot of our clients have a lot of expertise and knowledge about the sectors they work in.  But I find that there is a lack of understanding in a lot of places about just how the energy ecosystem works.
And so here’s a few--let me just point out a few of the charts that I think would be most helpful to look at.  One of them in the executive summary looks at the shift in energy intensive manufacturing over the last 25 years.
For all intents and purposes, the West has de-industrialized ammonia, steel, cement, plastics, and some of the most energy-intensive pillars of modern society.  So we’re going to talk in the paper a lot about the decarbonization that’s taking place in Europe and Japan and the United States.
But we should really be clear that after the de-industrialization that’s taken place in the West, um, the--it’s really the developing world’s adoption of wind, solar storage and nuclear power that are going to end up being the primary determinants of future global emissions outcomes.
Think about this.  Africa as a continent still uses energy on a per capita basis that was last seen in Europe in the 19th century.  That’s expected to change.  And I know that our clients that have read our energy papers before understand this, but I just want to reiterate this because it’s so important.
There’s a lot of work going on around the world to decarbonize the electricity grid and that’s great news.  And we have a lot of charts in here tracking on how that’s going, and the collapse in the power purchase agreement prices for wind and solar both in the U.S. and on a global basis since 2012 have been remarkable, you know, in 70 to 80, 90 percent declines.
That said, electricity only represents 15 to 20 percent of global primary energy consumption.  In other words, the vast majority of energy use globally is still direct energy consumption in the transportation sector, by industry, and for residential and commercial heating.
That represents around 80 percent of all energy use and until you start to decarbonize that, the--the decarbonization in the grid itself is only kind of--is a small and partial solution.
There are three pages in the executive summary which get into detail for the U.S., for China, and for Europe on energy use by sector and fuel type.  In other words, industrial transport, residential and commercial end users, and what kind of fuel they’re using, what’s the split between direct energy use and electricity within electricity, how does that break down or cross fossil fuels, renewables and nuclear, et cetera.
And you can really see how the three regions are different and what their commonalities are.  And so we do get--I think it helps--it’s extremely helpful to kind of understand the global energy ecosystem by looking at it in this way.
We also do talk about our market views.  We were bullish on oil and gas last June.  We didn’t feel like it had much more to fall, and since then traditional oil and gas stocks have rebounded.
So have renewables.  Renewables have done extremely well but they’re doing some strange things.  I mean if you really think about it, there’s no reason that I can see that the--the transition to electric vehicles will increase the market capitalization of the total auto industry, right?  I mean it’s a high volume, competitive, low-margin industry.
And yet the industry’s total market cap gained 70 percent in the last three years ending January.  So there’s some strange things going on there.  I mean I think you can make some people--you can make some arguments about how Tesla should do versus the other companies.
I don’t see why the total industry would rise by 70 percent because nobody is suggesting that automobile consumption per capita is going to be going up.  If anything, a lot of the investments that are taking place in the world are designed to make those numbers go down.
So in Section 1 we take a look at electric vehicles and--and why the revolution has been so slow so far.  Outside of a couple of countries, I’ve never seen Norway talked about more than over the last year with respect to its electric vehicle share of 60 percent.
There’s a lot of things to understand about Norway that are very different than most other countries in terms of its population, its population density, where its electricity comes from, how cheap its electricity prices are compared to Europe and the U.S., and then within Norway specifically what they’ve done to engineer this EV revolution.
I think once you understand all that, you’ll probably agree with us that we should dispense with Norway as a paradigm for the world’s high density, car-loving countries.  And then we take a look at how the EV revolution is going elsewhere.
And then there are--there are four key components in the analysis.  Number one is the good news which is if you look at the United States and Europe as an example, no matter where you live, transitioning from an internal combustion engine car to any of the top selling cars and trucks would entail climate gains.
And so in other words you would need, for example, if you lived in Virginia or the Carolinas, you would need to be driving a traditional car that gets close to 90 miles a gallon in order to generate--have the same EV footprint, uh, as, um--a GHT footprint as in an electric vehicle.
So that’s the good news.  The GHG benefits from switching look good.  When people do switch, the challenge is a couple things.  The life cycle of today’s life vehicles are much longer than they were 20 years ago.  My college roommate had a 1983 Ford Mustang.  It was a terrible car.  It was in the shop all the time.
And at the time, the average life cycle of a car was only maybe seven years or so.  Whereas today, the average age of life vehicles in operation is 12, and in some parts of the country longer.  So that’s great news for proactivity household wealth, but it delays the penetration of new technologies like EVs.
And I think a misunderstanding of that life cycle is why so many of the projections from BNEF and Price Waterhouse and all these other places a few years ago for what EV shares would be in 2020 were so wrong.  Most of those forecasts ranged from 5 to 15 percent.  Last year they were just two percent.
The other thing to keep in mind is a lot of the analyses we see will compare, let’s say, the price gap between a Chevy Bolt and a Toyota Camry.  Well, that’s great for countries and states where most people are buying Toyota Camrys and can switch to the Chevy Bolt.  And, you know, the price gap there is, you know, maybe 15 or 20 percent.
The facts are in the United States around 80 percent of the U.S. light vehicle sales are SUVs and other light trucks.  So the Chevy Volt, or the Chevy Bolt I should say, is not a product substitute for people who buy Ford F-150s or the Chevy Silverado.
When you actually look at those EV comparisons, the electric versions of those things which are coming out over the next year, couple years, the price gaps are much larger and so are the range differentials in terms of how far you can drive on them.  And, you know, that’s impacting the EV adoption cycle as well.
And then the last issue on EVs is there’s some evidence from European countries that--where a lot of EVs are being purchased that there were--they’re not necessarily replacing your internal combustion engine car, they’re supplementing them.  Because in most countries the EV purchasers are wealthier families, they buy an EV but it’s not, you know, replacing the EV for median income families and that obviously has a lot of climate implications as well.
The longest section in the entire paper this year has to do with electricity transmission.  A lot of deep decarbonization plans from Princeton and MIT and other places are finally acknowledging you can’t project 10 to 15--uh, a multiple of 10 to 15 times the amount of solar and wind generation capacity and have that translate into actual electricity on the grid unless you build a lot more transmission.
And so we first look on a theoretical basis what MIT and Princeton are saying about the benefits of building additional transmission.  These are the most hockey stickiest charts of all the hockey stick charts I’ve ever seen when you see one of the charts on the history of how--of the pace of transmission built in the United States compared to where these guys think it’s going to go.
The problem is where they’re saying it has to be built - California, New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts, Maine - these are some of the most NIMBY-est places in the country.  And I’m not sure what they’re thinking, uh, you know, about how this stuff is going to actually get built.
Because when you actually look on the ground at what happens to transmission projects, at least in the United States and in parts of Europe, it’s a hornet’s nests of siting challenges, legal challenges, and projects are taking 10, 15, sometimes as long as 17 years to get built after being planned.
So all these deep decarbonization plans are going to have to deal with that reality.  We talk through what I consider to be both a sad and farcical situation where there are massive gains to be had by Massachusetts importing cheap hydropower from Quebec, and then, um, a combination of the New Hampshire siting committee and some of its power generators killed the project, and so Massachusetts is going to have to combust more natural gas instead.
We talk about the history of some of the clean line projects in the United States that were supposed to connect Oklahoma wind with Tennessee, or to connect Kansas wind with the east coast, and how a lot of the state and local objections have essentially killed, torpedoed, or crippled a lot of those projects.
So these are some of the realities that you have to understand when you’re looking on paper at these wonderful projections of deep decarbonization plans.  They don’t get at some of these practical day-to-day issues.
Even when some of these projects are approved, one of our clients is working on a project to bring wind power from Wyoming to California.  They started working on it in 2007.  And it was also at one point fast tracked by the Obama administration, and the project is only 15 percent reliant on private lands; 85 percent is on federal lands.  And yet still here we are, um, you know, 14 years later and the project is still kind of, quote unquote, in development.
So anyway the bottom line is the United States doesn’t have broad legislation that supports federal eminent domain for electricity the way it did for the interstate highway system in the ‘50s and natural gas pipelines in the ‘30s, and that’s a pretty big issue.
Okay.  So on carbon sequestration I will simply say this.  The highest ratio in the history of all of science is the ratio of the number of papers written on carbon sequestration divided by the actual implementation of carbon sequestration.
You know, the--it’s a much more complicated process than people acknowledge.  Again, there’s a lot of cocktail napkin analysis that’s being done and has always been done, but the fact is to even sequester a small amount of, uh--of U.S. carbon emissions would--would require the creation of an infrastructure system whose throughput volume in the U.S. would be higher than the volume of all the oil that flows through the U.S. distribution refining pipelines.
So that is a--is a pretty remarkable number.  And then we also talk through some of the issues about carbon mineralization as well as direct air carbon capture.  And we walk through all the math here.
I’m simply going to tell you the conclusion from a paper in Nature Communications this year which talks about direct air carbon capture being an--and unfortunately an energetically and financially costly distraction in effective mitigation of climate challenges.
But we’ll show you the math.  Take a look at how much electricity and how much primary energy it would take to create the materials, essentially caustic soda, that would be required to react with CO
2
so that direct air capture can work.
And then I think one of the most interesting parts of the paper this year deals with the industrial sector.  On a global basis and particularly in places like China, the industrial sector is the largest user of energy.
And so I--the rational question people have been asking is ‘Well, why don’t we just electrify some of these industrial processes and then over time as we add more green electrons to the grid through wind and solar and hydro-expansion, we will essentially be decarbonizing the industrial sector.’
Now, there are certain processes, industrial processes, that can be electrified - some primary metals, secondary steel which is made in electric arc furnaces, machinery wood products, plastics and rubber - most of these things use fossil fuels for process heat which you could replace with electric heat.
It turns out it gets more complicated after that, like chemicals, pulp, paper, food, oil refining, uh, glass, bricks, cement.  They all have their own challenges that make them much harder to electrify in some cases.  You know, it’s as simple as saying “It’s hard to electrify production of things that don’t conduct electricity” which is what you’ve got with glass, brick, and cement.
And, you know, on every single one of these hard-to-electrify sectors you’ll find papers someplace that talk about pilot projects and demonstration projects.  The approach we generally use is when--when somebody approaches some kind of commercialization, then we’ll take a closer look and we’ll see how much it costs.
As things stand now, what we consider to be the harder-to-electrify industrial sectors use two and a half to three times the amount of energy as the ones that are easier to electrify.  And then even if all of those hurdles are overcome, you still have the issue that electricity per unit of energy is three to six times more expensive than natural gas.
Which kind of makes sense if you think about it because if you have an option to use natural gas combustion directly to provide heat, that’s going to be using a device that has maybe 60 to 70 percent efficiency.  If you then take natural gas and other fossil fuels and you start to combust them as well to make electricity it’s obviously much less efficient.
So in any case, the stickiness of industrial energy use in terms of its low contribution from electricity at just 12 to 15 percent has more or less been unchanged since the early 1980s.  So every time you see someone trumpeting massive electrification in the industrial sector, you should probably ask some pretty tough questions.
We have a section in the piece on our oil and gas call from last year.  The bottom line is that investing in the shale revolution was typically a train wreck.  If you look from 2010 to 2019, the aggregate free cash flow in the industry was negative every single year.
We felt this performance was more based on a collapse in capital discipline by management and the supply shock from fracking rather than a sign that there was an inflection point that we were at where demand for fossil fuels, domestically and internationally, was at a permanent decline.  So far it looks like we were right about that.
We’ve got a section in here that goes into a little more detail and you can take a look there.  And one of the real interesting sections in this paper looks at how much natural gas the U.S. might need in the future.
And we make a bunch of assumptions.  I think most nuclear plants will be 50 years old or more by 2035, so we assume that two-thirds of them are decommissioned.  No more coal plants.  You have some modest growth in hydro-power.    Some electricity demand growth for accommodating, let’s say, 30 percent EV penetration by 2035, et cetera, et cetera.
And if you make all these assumptions and you assume capacity factors of 25 percent for solar and 35 percent for wind, it makes a meaningful dent in--of about a third in natural gas demand, but only around a third.
And then again the bigger issue is that natural gas is used for electricity generation but also directly for heating and for industrial energy use.  And as we’ve discussed, if those two things don’t change very much, even if the pace of solar and wind capacity additions for the next 15 to 20 years matched the peak additions of the late ‘90s when there was a natural gas boom, the natural gas industry’s total production would only have to decline by maybe 10 to 15 percent versus today’s levels.
And it’s really an interesting analysis because what it shows you is even if you get very aggressive about future wind and solar growth, and the transmission generation--the transmission capacity required to accommodate that generation, under some kind of reasonable assumptions natural gas is still a pretty critical contribution to the overall energy ecosystem in the United States.
And so I think policy makers should be pretty careful before doing anything that assumes that that’s not going to be the case just based on some plans they’re seeing on paper today.
And the--you know, the conclusion that we made, um, that the--that my final sentence in the paper this year was that the overarching message of this paper is not climate nihilism or anything like that.  It’s that the behavioral, political, and structural changes required for the decarbonization are still grossly underestimated.
And if that’s the case, the companies that we all rely on for dispatchable thermal power and energy are going to need to survive and prosper until we get to that deep decarbonization ending place.
So that’s, uh--that’s it for the podcast.  There’s some other interesting topics in here.  And if you want to read something fun, you can read what I did in terms of analyzing the statements made--incorrect statements made about the causes of the Texas power outage.  We had some fun with that.
But anyway, that is our energy paper this year.  Take a look and we look forward to talking to you again soon.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Every two years, we take a close look at the performance of the private equity industry given its rising share of institutional and individual portfolios. Our findings this year: the private equity industry is still outperforming public equity, but this outperformance narrowed as all markets benefit from non-stop monetary and fiscal stimulus, and as private equity acquisition multiples rise. We examine manager dispersion, benchmarks, co-investing, GP-led secondary funds, the torrid pace of industry fundraising and manager fees in this year’s piece.
Introduction
The question of whether private equity outperforms public equity continues to be a hotly debated issue in investment finance.  In the latest food fight, Steve Kaplan at the University of Chicago takes on Ludovic Phalippou from the University of Oxford. Phalippou is the author of “
Private Equity Laid Bare
”, has a podcast with the same name, and asserts that private equity managers have not outperformed net of fees. Kaplan takes issue with Phalippou’s time period selection, his definition of private equity and choice of small/mid cap benchmark and cites consistent (albeit narrowing) outperformance of venture capital and buyout funds over time. In this Executive Summary, we discuss the high-level conclusions from our biennial private equity review. The
full private equity paper
contains our complete analysis with a broader discussion of topics, including the Kaplan-Phalippou debate.
Buyout performance
The charts below show average and median multiples of invested capital (MOIC) and internal rate of return (IRR) for buyout funds since the early 1990’s. MOIC is a simple measure of cash-in vs cash-out, while IRR is a time-weighted measure of return. Note how there’s only a small gap between average and median buyout manager results.
Before 2009, average MOICs and IRRs generally moved in tandem with each other. Since 2009, MOICs have been declining while IRRs have been rising. The primary reason: increased use of
subscription lines,
which allow managers to finance investments with bank loans and delay capital calls to LPs until later in the investment period. This practice increases the IRR of a fund at the expense of a small rise in MOIC, since LPs end up paying subscription line interest.MOIC is not time weighted and neither MOIC nor IRR measures performance vs public equity. Analysts
have converged on two concepts that address these shortfalls:
the Public Market Equivalent ratio (PME) and Direct Alpha.
PME compares private equity commitments and distributions to investments in public equity markets in the exact same time periods. The result is essentially an MOIC ratio of private equity performance vs the public equity benchmark used. Direct Alpha converts the PME into annualized outperformance in percentage terms. Note how average and median results for buyout are similar, as they were for MOIC and IRR. Since subscription loans impact the timing of upfront cash flows, they can materially boost Direct Alpha as well as IRR.
Why have relative buyout returns declined?
After the financial crisis in 2008-2009, the Fed and other central banks adopted “maximum accommodation” policies. These policies led to a sharp rise in public equity valuations. In addition, buyout acquisition multiples have increased as the food fight over private companies continues, propelled further by the SPAC boom which we wrote about
earlier this year
. So, higher buyout purchase prices and better-performing public equities have reduced buyout outperformance.
Are the recent annualized 1%-5% excess returns over public equity markets since 2009 enough given the illiquidity of private equity?
Rather than apply an abstract derived cost of liquidity, most investors will judge for themselves whether these returns suffice based on their consistency and magnitude.Buyout funds: what is the “right” buyout performance benchmark?
Some analysts are reluctant to use the S&P 500 as a benchmark for buyout managers that invest in smaller companies. While US buyout deal sizes have been rising, the average buyout is still much smaller than a typical large cap company. The median S&P 500 market cap is $21 billion, the average US buyout is $2.5 billion and the median Russell 2000 market cap is $1.1 billion. In any case, the chart below shows PMEs using the Russell 2000 instead. The results reflect the relative performance of the S&P 500 vs the Russell 2000 over time.Buyout manager dispersion
Average/median managers have consistently outperformed, but what happens if you pick a below-average buyout manager? Since 2010, the gap between top and bottom quartile managers has narrowed compared to prior decades, and the degree of underperformance for bottom quartile managers is pretty modest.Drivers of buyout performance
While cash flow data sourced from limited partners is a reliable way to measure performance of private equity funds, it does not allow a closer look under the hood to see what drives that performance. We asked one of the larger buyout managers we know for company-specific data for three consecutive buyout funds they managed. We decomposed the change in enterprise value into three sources: cash flow (EBITDA) growth, changes in valuation multiples and change in debt levels.
In each case, operating cash flow improvements at the company accounted for more than half of the total change in enterprise value, and for more than the impact of multiple expansion.
This is not meant to be indicative of the industry as a whole, but it does illustrate that operating improvements can play a primary role in generation of returns.Venture capital performance
As with buyout managers, VC manager MOIC and IRR also tracked each other until 2012 after which a combination of subscription lines and faster distributions led to rising IRRs despite falling MOICs. There’s a larger gap between average and median managers than in buyout, indicating that there are a few VC managers with much higher returns and/or larger funds that pull up the average relative to the median.VC managers have consistently outperformed public equity markets when looking at the “average” manager
. But to reiterate, the gap between average and median results are substantial and indicate outsized returns posted by a small number of VC managers.
For vintage years 2004 to 2008, the median VC manager actually underperformed the S&P 500 pretty substantially
.Venture capital: performance benchmarks and manager dispersion
One could make an even stronger argument that the S&P 500 is not the right benchmark for venture capital given much smaller deal sizes. The first two charts show average and median PME ratios for VC using different benchmark options.
Since the S&P 500 outperformed the Russell 2000 Index, the Russell 2000 Growth Index, the Russell Microcap Index and most other US equity benchmarks since 2010, using a different benchmark than the S&P 500 would simply make venture outperformance look larger since that date
.
As for manager performance dispersion, VC trends are similar to buyout. Since 2010 the gap between top and bottom quartile VC managers has narrowed and bottom quartile VC manager underperformance vs public equity is very modest. To be frank, I was expecting much worse from bottom quartile VC managers.Fundraising and the pace of investment
Since the pace of new investment has trailed fundraising, global “dry powder” has exploded since our last analysis, rising from $2 trillion to ~$3 trillion
. However, this figure includes all private equity categories and not just buyout and venture capital. For the latter two categories, dry powder is closer to $1 trillion
Increased use of subscription lines also overstates the “real” amount of undrawn and committed capital. The latest estimates indicate $500 billion in subscription lines outstanding, which is a meaningful portion of the increase in global dry powder since 2012The

Appendix on methodology for IRR, Direct Alpha, cash flow timing and subscription linesLine chart which shows average and median US buyout multiples of invested capital (MOIC) by vintage year. MOIC is a simple measure of cash-in versus cash-out. The chart shows that there is a small gap between average and median buyout manager results and since the 1990s managers have typically returned between 1.5-2x cash invested.Line chart which shows average and median US buyout internal rates of return (IRR) by vintage year. Unlike MOIC, IRR is a time-weighted measure of return. The chart shows that there is a small gap between average and median buyout manager results and that managers have typically delivered 10-25% IRR.Line chart which shows average and median US buyout public market equivalent ratios (PME) versus the S&P 500 by vintage year. PME compares private equity commitments and distributions to investments in public equity markets in the same time period. The result is an MOIC of private equity performance vs the public equity benchmark. The chart shows that typically the average and median managers have been able to outperform the S&P 500, with 1993, 1994 and 2008 vintage years being the exceptions.Line chart which shows average and median US buyout Direct Alpha versus the S&P 500 by vintage year. Direct Alpha converts PME into annualized outperformance. The chart shows on an annualized basis both the average and median manager typically outperformed the S&P 500 by around 4-5%.Stacked bar chart which shows average purchase price multiple (relative to EBITDA) for US LBO transactions since 2003. The chart breaks out the multiple into senior debt, subordinated debt, equity and other. The chart shows that multiples have been steadily increasing and are currently peaking at close to 12x.Line chart which shows average US buyout public market equivalent ratios (PME) versus both the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500 by vintage year. PME compares private equity commitments and distributions to investments in public equity markets in the same time period. The result is an MOIC of private equity performance vs the public equity benchmark. The chart illustrates the relative performance differences between the S&P 500 and Russell 2000 over time. Since the S&P 500 has outperformed the Russell 2000 since 2006, buyout PMEs vs the Russell 2000 are higher than buyout PMEs vs S&P 500 over the same time period.Line chart which shows US buyout Direct Alpha vs the S&P 500 by vintage year. The chart plots the median manager as well as the top and bottom quartile managers. The top line indicates top quartile managers have the greatest Direct Alpha, followed by the median immediately below, with bottom quartile at the lowest Direct Alpha. Since 2010, the gap between top and bottom quartile managers is narrowing, and the underperformance of bottom quartile managers has been modest (-5%).The stacked bar chart shows the change in enterprise value for a pre-GFC buyout fund and 2 post-GFC buyout funds.  The change in enterprise value is decomposed into 3 sources: cash flow (EBITDA) growth, changes in valuation multiples and change in debt levels.Line chart shows the average and median multiples of invested capital (MOIC) by vintage year for 2006 to 2017 venture capital funds. The average MOIC is consistently about 0.5 higher than the median MOIC across vintage years. Average and median MOIC rose from 2004 to 2012 vintage years, but have since fallen to mid-2000s vintage year levels (2.0x average, 1.5x median).Line chart shows the average and median internal rates of return (IRR) by vintage year for 2006 to 2017 venture capital funds. The average IRR was consistently about 5% higher than the median IRR until 2014, when the average IRR started to rise at a faster pace than the median. Nevertheless, average and median IRRs have increased with each vintage year.Line chart shows the average and median public market equivalent ratios (PME) vs the S&P 500 by vintage year for 2006 to 2017 venture capital funds. The average PME is consistently higher than the median PME. Both the average and median PMEs increased with each vintage year until 2012 when they began to plateau around an average of 1.4x and a median of 1.1x.Line chart shows the average and median Direct Alpha vs the S&P 500 by vintage year for 2006 to 2017 venture capital funds. Average Direct Alpha is consistently higher than the median. Direct Alpha shows that the average and median venture capital fund underperformed the market from 2004 to 2008, then began to consistently outperform.  Since 2015, the average VC manager’s Direct Alpha has risen to about 17% and the median manager plateaued at about 4%.Line chart which shows US venture capital average public market equivalent ratios (PME), showing the PME vs the Russell Microcap, the Russell 2000, and the S&P 500. A PME above 1 indicates that the venture capital performance outperformed the benchmark. Since 2004, the PME ratios for all benchmarks steadily increased from around 1 to around 2.2 in 2012. Since then the PME ratios have declined to around 1.6. Over time, the PME vs Russell Microcap has been slightly higher than the PME vs Russell 2000. There has been a wider gap between the PME vs Russell 2000 and the PME vs S&P 500. In 2012, the PME vs S&P 500 was 1.8 compared to 2.2 vs the Russell 2000.

MR. MICHAEL CEMBALEST:  Good morning, everybody, and welcome to the June Eye On the Market podcast.
In terms of public equity markets, the stall we've seen since April is consistent with the data that we're seeing.  There's a really robust recovery underway in earnings, capital spending, and other activity.
But there's a disconnect between that kind of recovery, exhaustible supplies of labor, and ultra-accommodated Fed policy.  That's what we wrote about last March, and the latest comments from the Fed on the gradual normalization of monetary policy are pretty consistent with a market pause.
The next hurdle for equities is going to be the rising domestic and international taxes.  Um, the blueprints are still being worked out so there's more to come on that front.
And a quick comment on Covid, which you can continue to track on our virus portal.  Infections and mortality, as everybody knows, are plummeting in the developed world.  And Latin America is really the last unrelenting hotspot on the planet.
But in the U.S., you now have to divvy up the population into the vaccinated and the unvaccinated.  And U.S. vaccination rates are now being eclipsed by Europe, Canada, and China.  And the pockets of unvaccinated people in the U.S. are still heavily affected by the disease.
And we look at hospitalization and infection rates among the unvaccinated, and they are two to three times higher than reported levels for the entire population.  So, um, still more to come on this whole question of the risks embedded in the unvaccinated population.
Okay.  So onto the main topic for today.  Every two or three years we take a close look at the private equity industry, not specifically our funds but the private equity industry, given its rising share of the portfolios for our institutional and high net worth clients.
And this year's update finds, unsurprisingly, that the private equity industry is still outperforming public markets, but this outperformance has narrowed a bunch, as all markets of all kinds are benefitting from non-stop stimulus and also as private equity acquisitions multiples rise.
So in the piece we get into this question of absolute and relative buyout and venture performance, what are the right benchmarks to use, what's going on with cone vesting, GP-led secondary funds, fund raising, manager fees, et cetera, et cetera.
On this--on this podcast I'm just going to point out a few of the main points.  One of the interesting things in here is we have the main arguments of the debate about private equity performance.  And, you know, Steve Kaplan at the University of Chicago and Ludovic Phallippou from Oxford take opposite sides of the argument.
We lay out their main arguments in terms of which benchmarks to use, time frames, and things like that.  The gap between them isn't that huge but there are a few points of contention that are interesting to look at.
The best news from this whole debate is that when I started doing this a few years ago, we were relying on venture economics and other databases for private equity performance that were voluntarily reported by the general partners.  That obviously has stale data, survivorship bias, and all sorts of other nonsense and garbage in there.
And for the last two rounds of this private equity review, including this one, we're now using a new dataset that is basically coming from the custodians to the limited partners.  So that data comes through good weather or bad; in other words, you know, whatever's going on, those cash flows are getting registered with the custodians and make their way into this database.
And so we no longer have really any questions about breadth, data quality, stale data, stuff like that, so that's a good thing.  So there are some concepts that you have to be familiar with when you're talking about private equity which is public markets.
Most of the people listening to this broadcast are familiar with them, but just to take you through them, multiple uninvested capital is a simple measure of cash in versus cash out.  In other words, what distributions do I get versus what I put in.  It's not time-weighted but it's a crude multiple of how much money you made.
Internal rate of return is a time-weighted measure of return.  There are shortfalls with that in terms of that it assumes the interim distributions are reinvested at that same rate.  Sometimes that's true, sometimes it isn't.
You know, we have all the information on multiples, on invested capital, and internal rates of return for buyout and venture.
The more interesting question gets into how do you compare it to public markets.  And there are some techniques that have evolved over the last few years that essentially time-weight a comparison portfolio and whether it's the S&P 500 or the Russell 3000 so you can get a sense for how your private equity or venture fund is doing relative to what you would otherwise have achieved vesting in public markets and so we've got that in here too.
One of the important things that has complicated life a little bit is the enormous use of subscription lines.  And subscription lines are used by managers essentially to defer their capital call.
So they're making investments, um, but they're financing them with short term bank lines, subscription lines.  And so then they're going to call capital later in the investment period.
What that does is it compresses the distance between the distributions and the capital calls, and so you're IRR goes up but at the cost of the interest charge on the subscription line.  You know, which is pretty small.
But what we've seen recently is that you--multiples on invested capital and internal rate of return used to move together.  Now, even though MOIC has been declining, IRRs have gone up because managers have been boosting their performance on an IRR basis with the subscription lines.  So you do need to understand that nuance if you're going to start looking at stuff like this.
So when we talk about declining outperformance of private equity, what are the two major drivers of that?  Well, you know, monetary and fiscal policy have boosted the multiples on public equities so that's narrowed the outperformance.
And also buyout acquisition multiples have increased.  There's been a food fight for private companies.  The SPAC boom has propelled that even further, and so the combination of really high multiples on public equities and higher buyout purchase prices have--is what has narrowed that private equity outperformance.
And when we do this kind of analysis, we have to stop the clock at some point.  In other words, we can't be looking at 2020 vintage years because not enough time has passed for distributions to come in and you'd be relying too much just based on the theoretical NAV.
So the last vintage year included in this analysis is 2017 with valuations and distributions all the way through the end of 2020.
So some of the other stuff that's in here that you might find interesting has to do with the dispersion of managers, like what happens if you pick a bad manager?  How much could you lose?
And what's interesting is the bottom quartile buyout and venture managers relative to the market have not done nearly as poorly as I suspected that they might.  So that's a good thing.  We also get into this question of where do the buyout returns come from and we look at three specific funds.
There's a perception that financial engineering and multiple expansion drive the vast majority of private equity returns. In certain transactions that's true.  But when we look at aggregate results for entire funds, the ones we looked at -  changes in operating performance, vendor relationships, pricing, supplier delivery times, you know, the actual operating characteristics of the company - improvements in those characteristics were the majority of the fund performance in each of the funds that we looked at which I thought was also interesting.
We do look a little bit at these GP-led secondary funds.  It's been an interesting phenomenon over the last few years.  Private equity funds will emerge for the sole purpose of buying deals late in the cycle from other private equity funds as they're wrapping up.
And the idea is instead of those funds just kind of rushing out of those investments of whatever they can get at the end of the fund life, these funds will take those straggler investments, reinvest them if necessary, and give them a new lease on life and a chance to mature to some proper level before they're monetized.
The returns so far on these funds look good but, you know, be aware that they--these funds are using 30 to 50 percent leverage at the fund level on top of the leverage that already exists in the--in each one of the companies that they're buying.
So that's a lot of leverage to carry into a potential downturn one day and part of the reason why those funds have performed as well as they have.
We're continuing unsurprisingly to see venture outperform buyout, but with a large dispersion of managers, so to some extent you get what you pay for.  And we take a look at the--at how gains on IPOs of venture-back companies are split between the investors and the post-IPO and pre-IPO investors.
Sometimes there's a sense that--that the pre-IPO investors are walking away with all the gains, and actually the opposite has been true most of the--in most of the--in the tech, interactive media and internet retailing IPOs over the last decade.  The majority of value created has gone to the post-IPO investor rather than pre-IPO investor.  So I thought that was interesting too.
We take a look at tow investment funds.  As you might suspect, the not having any fees charged is a boost to performance and the security selection is generally similar to the rest of the big commingled funds.  So if you subtract fees from the main equation, your performance goes up and your downside risk goes down.  That's pretty straight forward.  And, you know, the torrid pace of fund raising just continues.
You know, we've written many times in the past about the issues with under-funded defined benefit state, local, and county pension plans.  A lot of demand for private equity ventures is coming from that community and there doesn't seem to be any let up.
So we look at some of the academic papers that have been written and some other industry data in here.  Return on, uh--return dispersion on transactions within the funds.  We get into some questions on the methodology for some of these things.
And so anyway, that is our private equity roundup for this year and thank you for dialing in.  And in May we're going to take a closer look again at what's going on between the U.S. and China, and what the Fed has been up to.
The latest chart I saw shows that--that Fed purchases are now equal to treasury issuance.  So everybody afraid of federal monetization of the treasury debt, it's actually happening at 100 percent right now.  And then also at some of the things that are going on in the housing market.
So thanks again.  We'll talk to you soon.

An update on our SPAC analysis from last February, and a look at the strange mathematical paradox that ends up understating some critical COVID vaccine efficacy data
Spaccine hesitancy
. Last February, I wrote a piece with a dour outlook on the SPAC market: too many young risky, unprofitable companies coming to market; abnormal incentives for sponsors to close transactions even if the stocks collapse after closing; over-reliance on company projections rather than historical data; and a warning that poor SPAC merger returns relative to the market were a bad omen
1
. Well, here’s an update on the 98 SPAC mergers we analyzed that closed or liquidated from January 2019 to March 2021. Talk about “
red tides
”: while SPAC sponsors and “SPAC Arbitrage” investors are still making money, it’s an unsightly picture for everyone else in the SPAC ecosystem. See Appendix I for the full table showing average, median and 85
th
/15
th
percentile returns, and all of our assumptions and definitions.These subpar outcomes are not just the case with 2019-March 2021 SPACs. We ran the same analysis for the 85 SPAC mergers
since
March 2021, and the same patterns hold: enormous returns for SPAC sponsors, low positive absolute returns for SPAC Arbitrage investors and negative returns for everybody else.
The latest SPAC news
: institutional “PIPE” financing has dried up, forcing sponsors to allocate more of their economics to securing institutional commitments that are guaranteed to fund at closing; and increased risk that SPACs do not find a merger partner before their 2 year lifespan, in which case the SPAC would be unwound, SPAC investors would receive their capital back and sponsors would lose all of their upfront investment. For arbitrage-oriented investors, SPAC dislocation can create attractive opportunities; but that requires minimizing directional exposure to a group of clearly underperforming and usually unprofitable companies.
Implications
. While we are very optimistic on the US growth outlook, the primary driver of some assets might be liquidity instead. As the Federal Reserve lays out its plans to start slowing its asset purchases (perhaps by the end of the year), areas like the SPAC market that rely heavily on abundant liquidity may be early casualties. The portion of the stock market that is highly sensitive to liquidity conditions has been rising, just as the share highly sensitive to economic conditions has been falling (see chart below); SPACs may be an exaggerated preview of what lies in store for other overpriced assets unsupported by earnings growth.Vaccine efficacy understatement and the amalgamation paradox
You’ve seen the data on the US infection and hospitalization surge and vaccine hesitancy, particularly in hotspot states and counties with high Trump 2020 voting shares. We have all those charts on our web portal so no need to reproduce them here, other than the chart below showing how some US states are suffering the highest infection spikes on earth right now.I want to highlight something important on vaccines given recent reports from the Israeli Ministry of Health and the Mayo Clinic, since their efficacy data came in lower than prior reports.
Be careful when interpreting vaccine efficacy data releases, since reported numbers can underestimate what you expect them to measure in the first place
. To understand why, let’s walk through the two ways a vaccine’s impact is often reported: “shares of outcomes”, and “efficacy”.
“Shares of outcomes” in vaccinated people
.
This simple measure refers to the percentage of infections or hospitalizations in a given place/time that occurred in vaccinated people. One example is the infection outbreak on Cape Cod Massachusetts, where 74% of all infections were reported to have occurred in vaccinated people. This is the
least
helpful statistic to think about, since it does not account for the relative number of vaccinated and unvaccinated people. In other words, in a population overwhelmingly dominated by vaccinated people, it’s not surprising that more vaccinated people were infected than unvaccinated people. Another example, in the table below: 31% of all hospitalized people in England were vaccinated, but this is a useless statistic without adjusting for the relative number of vaccinated and unvaccinated people.
Vaccine “efficacy”
is used by vaccine companies and virus researchers to measure the impact of vaccination in reducing disease and other adverse outcomes. Efficacy normalizes for population size of vaccinated and unvaccinated groups. In England for example, vaccinated people were roughly 2/3 of the population and a third of hospitalizations; efficacy incorporates both figures by comparing rates of hospitalization. As shown, this rate declined from 0.0172% for unvaccinated people to 0.0042% for vaccinated people, a decline of 75%; that’s what efficacy measures.Possible vaccine efficacy understatement.
If you’re going to rely on the concept of efficacy, you also have to accept the possibility that it may understate what you expect it to measure.
There’s a mathematical paradox that can happen when a third variable (a “confounding factor”) applied to sub-groups results in substantially different interpretations than when looking at the overall group without this third variable. This is referred to as an
amalgamation paradox
2
, and in the vaccine efficacy case, the confounding factor is age which is strongly associated with higher vaccination status AND a higher likelihood of being hospitalized.
There’s a real life-example in the next table: if we divide the English population into under and over 50 cohorts
3
, we find that
vaccine efficacy vs hospitalization was actually higher for both age cohorts (87% and 94%) than efficacy for the population as a whole (75%)!
According to biostatistics professor Jeffrey Morris at the University of Pennsylvania, this also occurred in Israel: vaccine efficacy vs severe disease was higher for under and over 50 cohorts (92% and 85%) than for the population as a whole (67.5%). This is one of the strangest mathematical outcomes I’ve run into; evolutionary biologist Carl Bergstrom from the University of Washington and epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch from Harvard have discussed this very issue over the last few days on Twitter.
The important takeaway: vaccine efficacy may be significantly higher for people over 50 than commonly reported numbers. Hopefully, country health ministries will follow up with age stratifications that make this point clearer. Until they do, we will not have a clear picture on how well vaccines are actually performing and how much fading immunity is taking place. A recent Israeli Ministry of Health report showed sharp declines in Pfizer efficacy for January and February recipients (see Appendix II). However, this data was for the entire population of vaccinated and unvaccinated people. When it is eventually adjusted for age and other factors, Pfizer efficacy may look a lot better. Even so, most members of my COVID science advisory group believe that booster shots are merited as a “better safe than sorry” measure. This may have led Israel to adopt a booster policy for its over 50 population already, and to recommend boosters for everyone as early as next month.1

The over/under 50 stratification may still understate vaccine efficacy given the enormous effect that age has on hospitalization. According to the CDC, hospitalization risk for people over 64 is 2x-4x higher than for people aged 50-64. A more detailed stratification would yield even more accurate efficacy results.Line chart that shows the share of US equities that are highly sensitive to liquidity and economic growth since 1970Bar chart: Chart shows 25 largest infection increases for US states and countries over the last 21 days, shown as daily infections per million.

MR. MICHAEL CEMBALEST:
Good afternoon, and welcome to the August 2021 Eye on the Market podcast.  Two quick topics this week, SPACs and Vax.  The tagline here is that if people avoided SPACs instead of avoiding Covid vaccines, whose efficacy is often underestimated in the rush to release data, the US would be wealthier, and also closer to herd immunity, so what do I mean by that?
Well, let's see, let's do the SPACs first.  Last February, I wrote a piece that had a pretty dour outlook on the SPAC market.  Way too many young, risky, unprofitable companies coming to market, very strange and abnormal incentives for sponsors to close transactions, even if the stocks tank afterwards, overreliance on company projections, rather than actual historical data, and a sign from the early SPAC market that even though some of the returns were positive in absolute terms, they didn't look good relative to the market.
Well, we did an update on all the SPAC mergers, around a hundred of them that we analyzed that closed or liquidated over the last couple of years.  Talk about red tides.  This--it looks even uglier than when we looked at it last time, while the sponsors and some of the arbitrage investors who cash out of everything before closing are still making money, it's a very unsightly picture for everybody else in the SPAC ecosystem, whether you're a buy and hold or investor at the original SPAC, a pipe investor, post-merger investor, you know, you name it, the--almost all of the absolute and relative returns are negative, so you can take a look.
These poor outcomes weren't just the case for the hundred SPACs we looked at.  We ran the same analysis for the 85 SPAC mergers that have taken place since March of this year, and the same patterns hold enormous returns for the sponsors, low positive absolute returns for the arb investors, and then negative returns for everybody else, and what that's doing is, of course, institutional pipe financing which guarantees to fund at closing, is drying up, which is going to force some of the sponsors to allocate more of the economics to them to--otherwise, you can't close a deal, and the sponsors are also going to face the risk that they can't even find a merger partner before two years is up, in which case the SPAC gets unwound, the SPAC investors receive their capital back, because it was put in escrow, and the sponsors would lose all of their upfront investment.
So anyway, that's the SPACs.  Now, we shall move to the vacs.  You've all seen the data on the infection and hospitalization surge, and vaccine hesitancy in the hotspot states, and the issue with the high Trump voting shares and its connection to low vaccination and high levels of hospitalization.  We have all those charts on our web portal, and so we don't need to reproduce them here.
I did want to mention something important on vaccine efficacy.  Given the reports that have come out over the last couple weeks from the Israeli Ministry of Health and the Mayo Clinic, be careful when you're interpreting this vaccine efficacy data, since sometimes, the reported numbers can underestimate just how well these vaccines are working, so to understand why, let's talk about how vaccine impacts are reported.
The first one is shares of outcomes.  Right, so if you find out about this thing on Cape Cod where 74 percent of all infections occurred in vaccinated people, well, that doesn't help me very much, because the more that a population is dominated by vaccinated people, it's not surprising that more vaccinated people were infected than unvaccinated people, and one example of that in the UK is that around two thirds of all hospitalized people over 50 were vaccinated, but that's a meaningless statistic without adjusting for the relative size of that cohort relative to unvaccinated people over 50, and so that's why people generally--vaccine companies, virus researchers, they tend to describe the impact of vaccination and reducing disease and other adverse outcomes using an efficacy statistic.  Now, what does that do?
Well, you adjust the outcomes for the population sizes in both cohorts, so for example, in England, you had--you have 31 million people fully vaccinated, 17 million not vaccinated, so you adjust the size of hospitalizations by each population share, and then you get some numbers, and then you can measure the decline in the ratios, and the ratio of the declines is about 75 percent, and that's what efficacy measures, so in other words, .017 percent of unvaccinated people have been hospitalized, and .0042 percent of fully vaccinated people were hospitalized, and that's a decline of 75 percent, so that's that efficacy measure, it's a percent of a percent, and that's what it's meant to do, and the financial press and the regular press, and even a lot of science reports are teeming with estimates right now of what these efficacy numbers are.
Now, in some studies, these efficacy numbers are representative of the underlying efficacy of subpopulations within them, but sometimes, that's not the case, but there's this weird mathematical paradox that can happen when there's some other variable that explains the highly divergent outcomes across the subpopulations and is known as Simpson's Paradox.
So, for example, when you're looking at a chart or some data where one of your variables is vaccination and the other one is hospitalization rates, there's something weird that can happen when age is a confounding factor that is a stronger driver of the actual outcomes, and so what you have is, when you actually look at the numbers, and you should look at the tables in this week's piece, the vaccine efficacy of the under and over 50 cohorts is actually higher than the efficacy computed for the population as a whole, so this may sound like just a bunch of weird math, but I think it's pretty important, because in the case of England, the reported efficacy of the vaccination process there is showing up in the press as 75 percent, whereas the actual efficacy for the over 50 people is 94 percent and the efficacy for the under 50 people is 87 percent, again, both numbers higher than when you compute it for the population as a whole, and I think that's important because it affects behaviors, public policy, inclination of people to be vaccine-resistant, the desire for people to get booster shots, there's a whole lot of stuff that comes out, and I think the big takeaway here is that during the vaccine trials, they do all sorts of matched groupings by age, gender, comorbidity, like weight, obesity--they do all sorts of groupings so they can compare like populations to like populations to see if the vaccines are working versus a placebo.
So, for health ministries, or drug companies, to rush out with an efficacy measure for the entire population that's not stratified by anything, I understand why they're trying to do that given the spike in the delta variant, but some of these headline numbers are a little bit misleading, and I think underestimate and under-convey just how well some of these vaccines are actually doing, and England is a good example of this, and it was a little disappointing that the Israeli data, which showed a really sharp decline in Pfizer efficacy for people that got it in January and February, was not stratified by age, because that could have been a massive driver of that outcome, rather than fading immunity of an mRNA vaccine after six months, and most of the people in my science advisory group think that there is enough information in the Israeli data to justify booster shots on the notion that there is some level of fading immunity, but not nearly as much as what the Israeli Ministry of Health reported.
They reported a 16 percent efficacy rate for January vaccine recipients.  The FDA only approves vaccines that reach at least 50, so that 16 percent was a strange number, and my guess is that when that data is eventually stratified on all of the different levels that it needs to be, that the deterioration in Pfizer efficacy won't be nearly as much as what it was initially reported to, so--but to reiterate, most members of my Covid science advisory group that I've been working with for the last year and a half, do believe that booster shots are merited as a better safe than sorry measure, and combined with T-cells and other responses that fully vaccinated people with a booster should be reasonably well-protected against hospitalization, against the delta variant.
So anyway, I know it's an unkind thing to do to drop a load of math on you at the end of an August summer week, but I do think it's important, given the rush of all of these efficacy numbers.  A quick thank-you to my son, Max, who is at the Harvard Graduate School of Engineering and Applied Science for bringing this Simpson's Paradox to my attention in the first place, and in the appendix here, we have tables on all of our SPAC returns, definitions, and assumptions, as well as a table of vaccine efficacy as reported against infection, hospitalization, ICU admission, and mortality, so that's it for this time, and I look forward to talking to all of you again after Labor Day.  Bye.

While US vaccine resistance is not the sole province of one political party, there are some clear ideological factors at work as illustrated below. Now that the more contagious Delta variant has become dominant in the US, some unvaccinated members of the GOP may reconsider resistance/reluctance to receive medically proven vaccines.
Or maybe not:
even though 95%-99% of recent hospitalizations involve unvaccinated people, an Associated Press poll found that 80% of unvaccinated Americans “definitely” or “probably” won’t get vaccinated. To round out the week, a conservative talk show host wondered if Florida’s Governor was being bribed or threatened after he encouraged Floridians to be vaccinated.Higher reproductive number estimates for the Delta variant have prompted some to wonder whether the US or other countries will reimpose lockdowns.  My sense is that it’s probably too late for that given the prevalence of the Delta variant already.  The risk-reward of mRNA and vector vaccines seems pretty clear to me (see charts below), but to each his own.  In any case, the bottom chart shows that vaccines are “working”.For detailed CDC reports on foregone COVID cases, hospitalizations, ICU admissions and deaths vs adverse vaccine outcomes, for mRNA vaccines see here:
https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7027e2.htm#T2_down
and for the J&J vaccine, see here:
https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2021-07/05-COVID-Rosenblum-508.pdfNote the low pass-through from infection to hospitalization and mortality in the UK. I’m optimistic about this, but some of my colleagues believe it’s too early to draw conclusions.
More importantly, the UK has vaccinated 95%+ of its age 65+ population
. In the US, the same figures are 10%-15% lower depending on the state you’re looking at, and even lower in certain counties. In Missouri and Florida, COVID hospitalizations among the vulnerable (almost all unvaccinated people) are almost as high as they were last winter.In the prior note, I wrote that I did not expect lockdowns in the US irrespective of how bad the Delta variant gets. I still expect that to be the case;
if most unvaccinated people still refuse to be vaccinated, how could a governor justify locking everyone down to protect them?
In any case, here’s an update to US recovery metrics we follow. US manufacturing and services are still firmly in expansion mode, CEOs are very confident and plan to do a lot of hiring, retail inventories are at their lowest levels in 25 years relative to sales, and there’s still a lot of pent-up spending potential relative to actual consumption. The negatives: prices for homes and consumer goods have risen so much that consumers may now slow down their purchases, which when combined with the Delta variant, has prompted a rollover in “COVID recovery” stocks.Reliance of the big 4 tech/social media stocks on acquisitions to fuel growth
We will discuss this in more detail after Labor Day, but given the impact of these stocks on the broad market, an anti-trust revival might curtail these kind of acquisitions.  It’s too soon to tell since we have no idea which (if any) proposals from the House Judiciary Committee will be enacted as legislation or implemented as an Executive Order.  But this is one of the more important political questions to consider as we head into the fall, since as shown below, the market expects little to no impact of anti-trust regulations on the big 4’s earnings.Investor Odds & Ends: S&P earnings, NYC hotels, and the latest on personal, corporate and int’l taxation
With a quarter of S&P 500 companies reporting, 88% have beaten consensus EPS expectations and 86% have beaten consensus revenue expectations
The US CBD office utilization measure we track on our virus portal is at 50% for Texas cities but only 20%-30% elsewhere, among the lowest of all recovery indicators.  In NYC, direct+shadow+sublet space has increased by 40 mm sq ft to 80 mm sq ft, compared to 25-35 mm sq ft increases after prior recessions
A distressed hotel fund just bought the 725-room Lexington Hotel at $255k per key, which is a little more than half of what the seller paid for it in 2011.  Permanent closures of nearby hotels (Omni Berkshire Place, Roosevelt) and new rules designed to slow
NYC hotel
development appear to be part of the fund’s investment thesis.  NYC’s hotel industry is still in an “economic depression” according to the American Hotel & Lodging Association, with revenues down 67% vs 2019.  Other cities in the AHLA hotel market depression list: Seattle, Boston, Minneapolis, DC, Chicago and San Francisco
We don’t know how the tax landscape will change since the negotiations over the infrastructure and “human capital” bills are ongoing.  But as a placeholder, consider the following: Biden’s
original proposal
included a 28% corporate rate on domestic income, no deferrals, and a 26.25% GILTI minimum tax after eliminating the exemption for normal returns and eliminating the commingling of foreign tax credits across countries (effectively moving back to a worldwide tax system); new higher taxes on oil & gas; a new SHIELD tax on foreign entities operating in the US; no commingling of foreign tax credits across countries; a cap on like-kind exchanges; full unification of capital gains and ordinary income tax rates for HNW individuals; and forced realization of capital gains at death
We now believe that the
negotiations
are headed for a 25% corporate tax rate, a GILTI tax of 15%-19%, partial commingling of foreign tax credits, and possibly a minimum book tax of 15%-20% which we estimate would have a negligible impact on S&P 500 earnings; an increase in capital gains to 28% instead of full unification with ordinary rates; and a possible doubling of the SALT deduction from $10k to $20k. There’s a long way to go, but it is notable how different the possible outcomes are from the original proposal
There’s a lot of talk about an
international agreement on a minimum tax rate
.  However…how would this actually work?  It falls apart considerably if countries do not accept a binding and universally applied definition of income, which means countries would have to agree to unify tax treatment for opportunity zones, R&D credits, drilling expenses, bonus depreciation, LIFO vs FIFO for inventory, bad loan write-offs, orphan drug credits, etc.  Otherwise, countries would STILL be able to engage in tax competition with each other and have effective tax rates below the minimum level.  This could take years to sort out and implement

MR. MICHAEL CEMBALEST:  Good afternoon, welcome to the late July Eye on the Market.  This one is titled Red Med Redemption, which you’ll understand in a minute.  Topics for this week are the issues around politics, vaccination resistance, and the Delta variant.  Also want to give you a quick summary of a US economic recovery update and then some quick advance comments on something we’ll cover more in the fall, which is big tech reliance on acquisitions to fuel growth and the potential for the House Judiciary recommendations on antitrust to derail some of that.
So there’s a couple of charts on the first page that the podcast is not going to do it justice.  Vaccine resistance is not the sole province of one party; we know that.  But when you look at the data, there are some very clear party-specific factors at work here.  The first chart looks at the vaccination rate as a function of the liberalism or conservatism of the Congressional representative, and there’s a pretty clear pattern here where, that shows where the red dot GOP cluster has significantly lower vaccination rates.  And then also a chart, some of you may have seen something like this before, but we run a county-specific cluster on the Trump share of the 2020 vote and vaccination by county.  And there’s a pretty clear trend there as well.
So look, I mean it is what it is.  And the shoe fits here, and so the big question is will some members of the GOP reconsider their resistance or reluctance to receive these vaccines?  So far, even though about 95 to 99% of recent hospitalizations involve unvaccinated people, an Associated Press poll found that 80% of unvaccinated Americans plan to stay that way.  And I thought this was fascinating.  A conservative talk show host actually wondered if Florida’s governor was being bribed or threatened simply because DeSantis decided to step out and recommend that more Floridians be vaccinated, which is kind of remarkable.
The reproductive number for this Delta variant is pretty high and poses substantial risks to the vulnerable population of unvaccinated people.  I don’t think lockdowns make sense, in large part because I think it’s too late for that.  You’re already looking at 80%-plus prevalence of this Delta variant in the US and a bunch of other Western countries, and I don’t think lockdowns would be able to control it anyway.
To me, the risk/reward of the mRNA and vector vaccines is pretty clear.  We have a couple of charts in here that show the ratio of foregone deaths and long-haul COVID cases relative to the Guillain-Barre, which is a very severe neurological disorder.  How many cases of that would you expect per million compared to deaths in long-haul COVID if you don’t get vaccinated?  And a similar-looking chart for the mRNA vaccines, and there the myocarditis and some of the other things that young people have gotten is generally treatable.  And there the ratios are similarly high in terms of the foregone COVID outcomes from vaccination are many, many, many, many multiples higher than the chances of getting an inflammation condition.
But people can view this data in any way they want, to each his own.  And it looks like this vaccine resistance is going to be pretty difficult to break through.  In the UK, pardon the squeaking, that’s my dog playing with a toy, in the UK, the pass-through from infection to hospitalization and mortality has been very low.  In other words, infections have spiked enormously, whereas hospitalization mortality hasn’t moved that much at all.
I’m optimistic about this.  Some of my colleagues believe it’s too early to draw conclusions.  But the main issue is that the UK has vaccinated 95% or more of its population over 65.  In the US, the same figures are about 10 to 15% lower, depending on the state you’re looking at.  And in some of the counties, it’s much lower than that.  And you can see for yourself the impact of those lower vaccination rates.  In Missouri and Florida, the COVID vaccination rates amongst unvaccinated people are almost as high as they were last winter, and they’re still rising.
So look, I think the situation is the Delta variant is spreading.  There is a very large cohort of people that are protected in the United States and parts of Europe.  I don’t think that most governments, either federal or local, are going to lock down large components of society and impose mobility restrictions to protect the unvaccinated, particularly since most of them are that way by their own choice.
So in any case, here’s an update on some US recovery metrics that we’re following.  US manufacturing and services are still firmly in expansion mode.  CEOs are very confident and plan to do a ton of hiring as well as capital spending.  There is a lot of pent-up spending potential relative to actual consumption.  We measure spending potential by looking at taxable income, transfer payments from the government, increases in housing wealth, increases in financial wealth.  And so potential spending is still running, is still much higher than actual levels of consumption.  And retail inventories relative to sales are at their lowest levels in decades.  So there’s a lot of pent-up activity still to come.  The pace of US growth may slow, but it’s slowing from a very fast pace to a still pretty fast pace as we head into the fall.
The big negatives are prices for homes, cars, and other consumer goods have gone up so much that there’s a bit of a consumer strike that may hit.  Consumers are now signaling through various surveys that they don’t think it’s a good time anymore to buy certain household durables, cars, and houses.  And so that may take a chunk out of growth simply because demand is being destroyed.  And because of that, there’s been a rollover in some of these COVID recovery stock baskets.  Those are the kind of things that I expect will pick up again once we get through the fall.
And then again, the biggest challenge for the economy right now I think in some ways is how sticky wage inflation is going to end up being.  I think consumer price and goods inflation will rollover, but the wage inflation numbers look pretty sticky.  The latest statistics I was looking at show some of the highest nominal wage growth that we’ve seen in 25, 30 years on a percentage year-on-year basis.  Now that’s a good thing.  Wage growth does level out some of the economic inequalities and wealth inequalities, and all things being equal, it’s a good thing.  The only challenge is it’s inconsistent with super-accommodative monetary policy from the Fed.  Those two things don’t go together.  And at some point, there’s going to be a reckoning for the Fed in terms of how they deal with that.
There’s one last topic that I wanted to briefly mention, and that has to do with the potential for a serious antitrust revival.  Right now, the House Judiciary Committee is talking about a whole bunch of things.  What actually gets passed into legislation or enacted as an executive order is still very unclear.  So it’d be premature to make a lot of substantial portfolio decisions based on things coming out of the Judiciary Committee.
That said, we do need to pay close attention to this.  The top five firms, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook, account for 25% of US market cap, by far the highest level since the late 1980s and around double the market cap of the top five firms even in the 2000 bubble.  So this is a very concentrated market, substantial outperformance of a lot of these mega-cap names versus the rest of the market.
And they’ve also been driving, they’ve been the primary driver for margin expansion, at least in terms of the overall tech sector.  If you look at operating margins for the S&P 500 just for consumer discretionary staples, healthcare, and industrials, those numbers have actually drifted down.  So the margin story is really all about information technology and communications services.  The markets are expecting the pace of earnings for the big four to continue at roughly the same pace that they’ve been growing over the last decade, and that’s when we have to start asking questions.  ‘Cause when you look at acquisitions in new sectors versus core businesses for Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and Google, the ratio is roughly either two to one or three to one in terms of new sector acquisitions versus original core business.  So any material change to antitrust legislation or de facto policies could have a big impact on the valuation of these companies going forward.  So we’ve got a few charts, got a couple of charts in this Eye on the Market, a lot more that we’ll be discussing about all of this in the Eye on the Market after Labor Day.  But I did just want to mention that, bring that to everybody’s attention.
The primary purpose of this week’s note is really just to discuss the Delta variant.  I’m seeing some modeling that suggests that whatever happens, this Delta wave will be over in the US by the middle to the end of October.  So hopefully that’s correct, but we’ll have to see.  So thanks very much for listening, and enjoy the rest of your summer, bye.

COVID and Thy Brother’s Keeper
“
If you’ve ever desired a vacation on a ventilator in the ICU, then not getting vaccinated is probably for you
”
Craig McCoy, former paramedic and president of Mercy Springfield Communities Hospital, Springfield Missouri
I led an internal discussion recently on the Delta variant for our asset management business.  The details can be found in Section 1 on our virus portal
here
.  Main messages: while the Delta variant has caused a small number of breakthrough hospitalizations and deaths for vaccinated people, the main risks overwhelmingly affect unvaccinated and immunocompromised people with no or insufficient antibody responses.  From an investor’s perspective, developed world equities should be able to withstand the Delta variant; a chart we added on economic throw-weight (trade, FDI and portfolio flows), vaccination and mortality by country explains why.
One important chart to watch is the first one from the UK
: so far, a large spike in Delta infections has not led to a surge in overall hospitalization or mortality.
However, this masks what’s happening to unvaccinated people over 50 in the UK: 14% of such Delta infections ended up in the hospital and almost 4% died
1
figures which are 4x higher than for vaccinated people over 50.  The good news: in the UK, 96% of people over 50 are vaccinated, reducing the size of its at-risk unvaccinated population. However, in the US age 50+ vaccinations are ~75% nationwide (lower in many rural counties), resulting in larger populations of at-risk people; and in hotspot states (AR, FL, LA, MO, NV, WY), hospitalizations are rising more rapidly than in the UK.
Even so, my primary message to the group was that the US reopening train has left the station and that the Delta variant is unlikely to have a durable impact on US equity markets.
Federal and local
governments are unlikely to reimpose mobility restrictions to protect a cohort that is mostly unprotected by its own volition.  The policy borrows from Genesis 4:9: “
you are not thy brother’s keeper if he chooses to expose himself to COVID
”, irrespective of whatever his reasoning may be.  A February NYT article
2
described how younger generations are bearing unacceptable sacrifices to protect older ones.  I doubt the NYT would have published this while Trump was President, for fear of being seen as aligning itself with his Administration’s views.  But with a new administration in DC, I suppose it’s safer to make one’s intergenerational prosperity preferences clearer.
Charts: 96% vaccination rate of people over 50 explains the gap between UK infections and deaths; in the US, the reopening train has left the station irrespective of Delta variant outbreaksThe Fed as firefighter and arsonist at the same time
I read something recently which referred to the Fed as both firefighter and arsonist.  That’s a good description: resuscitating private sector demand while simultaneously destroying decades of underwriting and investment discipline in the process.  The firefighting resources the Fed is using: the easiest monetary policy in US history other than during wartime; and a symbiotic relationship with the US Treasury which now entails the Fed buying the entire stock of net Treasury issuance.  You have to see it to believe it.During the March 2009, 2012 and 2020 selloffs, the right question to ask was “what could go right”.  When markets reach all-time highs and are close to the highest valuations on record (as they are now), the right discipline is to focus on risks as well.   The US and global economy are set for a powerful recovery as pent-up corporate and household demand is unleashed.  In the US, for example, household debt service ratios are close to
the lowest levels in 40 years
, suggesting a sustainable expansion in consumption.  Even so, markets are pricing a lot of that in.  As the world resets closer to trend growth in 2022, I envision modestly higher inflation in which industrials, energy, financials and other reflation plays outperform; and a market in which earnings growth drives equity returns, rather than rising valuations.In any case, here are some ashes that can be laid in part at the doorstep of the Fed and its policies
: a collapse in the spread on high yield bonds, a locust-like scourge of secondary equity offerings from unprofitable companies, a rise in the market cap share of unprofitable companies, a surge in home prices and perhaps most concerning,
a collapse in loan underwriting standards
.
Even when compared to the free-wheeling credit environment of 2007, lenders have discarded any discipline they used to have
regarding covenants, restricted payments clauses, protections against layering and subordination, mandatory payments from asset sales, etc.  This kind of thing is never a problem until you hit the bumpier part of the business cycle.US-China economic divorce picks up steam, but is that what’s negatively affecting Chinese tech stocks?
The 25% decline in Didi’s stock has refocused investors on the US-China economic divorce.  However, it’s important to understand that there’s still plenty of normalcy in the US-China economic relationship.  China’s share of US imports is only modestly below 2018 levels, US stocks exposed to the trade war are doing fine vs the market, US semiconductor exports to China are still rising despite Huawei, US investors continue to accumulate more Chinese stocks and bonds, and unlike Russia, China has not engaged in economic warfare via its US Treasury holdings.  Only bilateral FDI flows appear to be suffering from changes in national security policy.That said, the Biden administration has unleashed an alphabet soup of China-targeted policies:
Executive Orders
restricting China’s access to US sensitive data via consumer apps and restricting US investment in Chinese companies affiliated with its military;
Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act
(de-listing of Chinese companies non-compliant with SEC data requirements);
CHIPS Act and 5G Emergency Appropriations
($ for US semiconductor companies);
Endless Frontier Act
($ for STEM R&D);
Strategic Competition Act
(CFIUS oversight of mergers and gifts by Chinese entities to US institutions);
Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Provisions
(“Buy America” requirements for iron and steel in US infrastructure projects);
Meeting the China Challenge Act
(sanctions for cyberattacks, IP theft and economic espionage);
Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act
(sanctions on US and Chinese companies knowingly using forced labor or conducting surveillance)
China’s possible partnership with the Taliban in Afghanistan won’t play well in DC either.  Even so, many US initiatives are meant to boost US competitiveness and only a couple target Chinese companies in the MSCI China index, and usually impact smaller ones.
In fact, the
largest risks facing Chinese tech stocks and ADRs come from China rather than the US.
Chinese regulators have implemented guidelines aimed at curbing monopolistic practices, limiting lax underwriting activities, policing data privacy, censoring content, addressing worker mistreatment and reforming entire industries like fintech and education. While the
timing
of enforcement actions on Didi suggest that there’s a message to US politicians in there as well, domestic policy concerns were the driving factor behind China’s decision to order mobile stores to remove Didi’s ride-hailing app.
On top of all that,
China just proposed new rules to require companies with more than 1 million users seeking to list in foreign countries to undergo a cybersecurity review
due to the risk that data and personal information could be “affected, controlled, and maliciously exploited by foreign governments”. This review will look into possible national security risks as well.
Whether new risks facing Chinese tech stocks are due to the US-China policy war or to Chinese domestic policy actions, large Chinese tech stocks now face hurdles that suggest the need for lower valuations than their US counterparts (they now trade at roughly the same level, as illustrated below).I don’t think Biden's China agenda has the capacity to derail China’s economy from whatever trajectory it’s on.  That said, a decline in globalization and a rise in US national security enforcement argue for slightly higher inflation in the years ahead, which we discuss next.The Pig and the Snake: a unified theory of the US, China, wages, jobs, inflation, opioid use, the WTO and investment portfolios for 2022 and beyond
The US economy is booming: capital spending and hiring tailwinds should last a few more months at least.  There are some wacky inflation readings on the high side, but most professional economic forecasters and market-based inflation expectations are looking past them (the spike in used car prices is one example).On goods, services and commodity prices, I think benign inflation expectations for 2022 are right.  In a few months, the pig will move through the snake and these price measures should be within the Fed’s comfort zone.
However, I’m less convinced about wage inflation.
There’s a lot riding on the assumption that expiration of COVID unemployment benefits this fall will loosen tight labor markets.  Perhaps it will.
But the exhibits below show a lot of momentum beyond COVID unemployment payments
: price hike intentions outstripping wage hikes, wages rising faster than employment, the highest number of “hard to fill” job openings and wage increases on record, more people who don’t want a job vs people who do, and a high “reservation wage” reflecting the cost of luring employed and unemployed persons to new jobs.To be clear, rising wages are a positive development for the US economy but there are levels at which the Fed’s zero rate policy becomes inconsistent with them.
To bring the whole US-China-wage-inflation discussion full circle consider the following, illustrated below
:
In 2001, the West allowed China into the World Trade Organization…
After which China immediately launched a massive and unprecedented intervention in its currency markets to prevent appreciation and boost its manufacturing and export shares….
Which allowed China to mount the greatest economic boom in post-war history…
Flooding the US with cheap goods (the US import price index from China is at the same level as in 2004)…
But which contributed significantly to an acceleration of US manufacturing job losses…
And a collapse in the US of the share of gross profits accruing to labor vs capital…
Whose aftershocks include the opioid epidemic, rising polarization and growing wealth inequality
With wages now rising, the US labor share of profits is finally getting closer to its post-war average, something the Fed will be VERY reluctant to interfere with.  As a result, if wage pressures remain my guess is that the Fed will not do much at first, creating more reasons to favor reflation strategies in portfolios in 2022 and beyond.1

MR. MICHAEL CEMBALEST:  Good afternoon and welcome to the July ""Eye on the Market"" podcast. We start this week with a discussion about the delta variant with some comments on the Fed; in wake of what's going on with DD; we talk about the U.S./China economic divorce. And then we conclude with a unified theory of a whole bunch of things:  the U.S., China, wages, jobs, the World Trade Organization and investment – and implications for investment portfolios in 2022 and beyond.
So let's start with the delta variant. I think at this point the information that's out there is doing a good job of summarizing the facts and research on the ground. There are a small percentage of breakthrough hospitalizations and deaths for people that are vaccinated taking place in the Western world. But the main risks are overwhelming affecting unvaccinated and immunocompromised people that either have no or insufficient antibody responses.
From an investor's perspective I think the developed world equity market should be able to withstand this delta variant, and we added a chart on our virus web portal to explain why it looks at vaccination, mortality by country, along with its economic throw weight. And what you can see is that the places that have the highest levels of mortality and low vaccination tend to have very low global economic throwaway in terms of trade, FDI portfolios and stuff like that.
And in some ways the most important chart to watch is the one from the U.K. where there is a massive spike in delta infections that has not led to a surge in overall hospitalization and mortality.
This masks what's going on underneath, which is that the unvaccinated people over 50 in the U.K. are suffering substantially – 14 percent of the delta infections ended up in the hospital and almost four percent of them died. But it doesn't show up in the overall numbers because in the U.K. 96 percent of all people over 50 are vaccinated. So the cohort of at-risk, unvaccinated people over 50 is pretty small. In the U.S. that figure that was 96 percent over 50 vaccinations in the U.K.; in the U.S. that number is 75 percent; lower in a lot of places. And in the emerging world obviously the percentages are much lower than that.
Even so, my primary message to the group was that the train has left the station in the U.S. and a lot of other Western countries and the delta variant is going to have a large impact on certain individuals but not on markets themselves. Most federal and local governments in the West are unlikely to reimpose mobility restrictions, particularly since we're dealing with a cohort that's exposed that are mostly unprotected by their own volition.
And the policy seems to be – this is not my point of view – but the policy seems to be you are not ""thy brother's keeper"" if he chooses to expose himself, irrespective of whatever his reasoning might be. I thought it was interesting that even the
New York Times
, which I was surprised to see, published a piece on how younger generations are bearing unacceptable sacrifices to protect older ones. I really doubt
The Times
would have published this while Trump was president for fear of being seen as aligning themselves with Trump, but with the new administration in DC it's now safer to make your intergenerational preferences clearer.
So the bottom line is that there is a substantial number of unvaccinated people over 50 who are at risk in the developed world, but given the shrinking size of that cohort I don't think that you're going to see governments do that much permanent about them that affects markets.
We had a reasonably optimistic stance heading into this year, mostly based on the notion that there's a lot of pent-up household and corporate demand that's going to have to be met through increased spending, increased hiring, increased investment, and all of that's playing out. But boy, a lot of that is priced in. We're now halfway through the year; the markets have done extremely well.
And when we take stock of things like massive number of secondary offerings from unprofitable companies, a collapse in high-yield bond spreads to tightest levels on record, surging home prices, and then just really bad underwriting discipline in things like the loan markets. It seems like we're getting closer to the edges here of where the Fed has wrung every bit of investment aggressiveness that they can have priced into financial markets.
And so a couple things from here:  I think earnings growth is going to be the driver of markets; we've run out of room for multiple expansion. And I think the risks are more balanced from here, whereas over the last 18 months it was pretty clear that you were going to be getting a stimulus-related boost to overall markets. And so the risks appear a little bit more two-sided right now.
We also get into a discussion of DD, the 25 percent decline in the stocks since China announced its enforcement actions has refocused a lot of people on the risk of Chinese tech stocks and the U.S. economic divorce with China.
Before getting into the details on that, however, this is an example where there's a little bit too much attention being paid to a couple of stocks that have gotten hit and not enough to some of the broader context. The China share of imports into the U.S. is only a little bit below the 2018 pre-trade war levels. The U.S. stocks that are exposed to the trade war are doing fine versus the market. Semiconductor exports to China are still rising, despite the situation with Huawei. U.S. investors continue to accumulate Chinese stocks and bonds. And there's no sign that China, like Russia did, is engaged in any kind of economic warfare via its treasury holdings.
So there's a bunch of stuff that's more normal than abnormal as it relates to the U.S.-China relationship. The clearest thing that you could say is suffering is when you look at the bilateral foreign direct investment data in both directions it's slowed down pretty substantially from where it was let's say in 2016 and 2017.
That said, the Biden Administration has unleashed an alphabet soup of China-targeted policies related to U.S. data:  consumer apps, U.S. investment in Chinese companies affiliated with the military requiring the delisting of Chinese companies that don't comply with SEC data requirements, throwing tons of money at U.S. semiconductor and stem companies, congressional oversight of mergers involving China and gifts by any Chinese entities to U.S. institutions. Buy America requirements for infrastructure projects, in terms of iron and steel, sanctions on China for cyberattacks, intellectual property theft, the sanctions on U.S. and Chinese companies knowingly using forced labor. It actually got to the point where some Progressives went to the Biden Administration and said, ""Hey, can you please cool it on some of this stuff? Because we may lose China as a partner in climate discussions."" In any case – and then on top of that China may have a possible partnership with the Taliban in Afghanistan; I can't imagine that would play well in DC either.
Even with all of that alphabet soup of anti-China policies the larger risks facing Chinese tech stocks and ADRs, which have performed pretty poorly over the last few months come from Chinese domestic policy concerns, rather than the U.S. economic conflict with China. Chinese regulators – and some of their actions have been kind of impressive when you think about the regulatory lapses that have taken place in the U.S. over the last 25 years – Chinese regulators have been very active with guidelines aimed at curbing monopolistic practices, limiting lax underwriting activities – that's what canceled the ANT [phonetic] financial IPO, policing data privacy, addressing worker mistreatment, reforming industries.
And so while the timing of the enforcement actions on DD suggests that they also wanted to sense a message to U.S. politicians, the domestic policy concerns were really the driving factor behind this decision to require mobile stores to rule that out.
And then on top of that, over the weekend China proposed new rules requiring companies with more than a million users that want to list in foreign countries to undergo a cybersecurity review to make sure that the data ""won't be maliciously exploited by foreign governments,"" is the way they phrased it, and they'll also look at national security risks as well.
So until very recently Chinese and U.S. tech stocks traded at roughly the same multiple of around 25 times forward earnings. These new risks that are mostly coming from China, rather than from the U.S., suggests that there should be a wider gap between them.
The last section in this week's piece is titled ""The Pig and the Snake,"" and has to do with a unified theory we have of the U.S., China, wages, jobs, inflation, the World Trade Organization, and implications for investment portfolios.
So the U.S., as we mentioned, is booming; capital spending and hiring indicators should give us some tail winds that last a few month. There is some whacky inflation readings that you've probably read about:  used car prices, strawberries, motor vehicle insurance. But most professional economic forecasters and the market-based inflation expectations are looking past them.
And I think that's probably right. I think goods and services and commodity-priced inflation in 2022 will come back down. And the pig will move through the snake, so to speak, and the inflation indicators should be within the Fed's comfort zone.
The thing that's much more concerning is wage inflation. There's a lot riding on the assumption that the expiration of COVID and unemployment benefits this fall will loosen labor markets. And they probably will, to some extent. But when you look at the momentum in labor markets there's a lot going on other than the COVID unemployment payment situation. Price hike intentions are outstripping wage hikes; wages are rising faster than employment itself. You've got the highest number of hard-to-fill job openings and wage increases on record. You have a lot more people who don't want a job versus people that do.
And then there's thing called the Reservation Wage, that reflects the cost of luring employed and unemployed people to new jobs. And that's been going up. And so there's a lot brewing in here that suggests that we're heading into a period of substantially-rising wages at a pace that's faster than what we've seen in a long time.
Now to be clear, rising wages are a good thing, a positive development for the U.S. The challenge is there's a level of wage inflation that's inconsistent with the Fed's zero rate policy. And here's where this whole U.S.-China discussion comes full circle. And so you'll probably want to look at the charts that correspond to this discussion, but let me just walk you through how I see it.
So in 2001 the West finally relented and allowed China into the World Trade Organization. On a dime China immediately launched the most aggressive and unprecedented intervention in its currency markets that anybody's ever seen. The goal was to prevent appreciation of currency in order to boost its manufacturing and export shares. And, boy, did it work. China experienced the greatest economic boom in postwar history, absolutely outstripping the number two country, which is Korea, by a mile in terms of its fastest 30 years of growth.
Unfortunately that Chinese economic boom was not a rising tide lifts all; there were some zero sum games issues in there. Their currency intervention and other policies contributed substantially to a collapse in U.S. manufacturing jobs. They were declining at a slow pace during the '60s all the way through the end of the '90s, but then the U.S. manufacturing jobs completely collapsed after China joined the World Trade Organization.
And then you also had a collapse in the U.S. in labor's share of profits, right? These profits either go to labor or capital and there was a collapse in labor share of profits. And then from that we've got all sorts of aftershocks related to opioids, polarization and growing wealth inequality.
So now wages are finally rising again and labor's share of profits is finally getting closer after a 15- to 20-year lull, to where it was for most of the postwar era. The Fed's going to be really reluctant to interfere with that. And as a result, as the wage pressures build I don't think the Fed's going to do much of anything upfront, and that creates, from an investor's perspective, even more reasons to favor reflation strategies in portfolios in 2022 and beyond. So when you get a chance you can talk to your advisors about that those reflation strategies are. But that's how I see it.
So when you look at what's going on in the labor markets now you can connect, in my view, what the Fed is up to everything, dating back to the decision to allow China into the World Trade Organization in 2001, and what the costs and benefits of that decision was to the United States.
So anyway, thank you very much for listening and we will talk to you next time.

“Help Wanted”.
We expect semiconductor, vehicle and other goods bottlenecks to resolve themselves in the months ahead, and interpret declining business surveys as the result of a temporary supply shock and not a sign of inadequate demand. As a result, growth should rebound in 2022, and positions that benefit from reflation should benefit (energy, value and cyclicals). However, while goods bottlenecks will dissipate, the US will still face tight labor markets and rising wages that are at odds with current Fed policy
Our prior note looked at semiconductor, vehicle, goods, shipping and other physical bottlenecks that are leading to lower growth forecasts for the next 2 quarters. We’re starting to see signs of improvement: a small decline in anchored LA/Long Beach containerships, freight rates falling from peak levels, a decline in commercial rail delays from 14 days in August to 3.5 days and a 20% increase in Taiwanese production of 8-inch wafers typically used in automotive systems since January of this year. Bottlenecks should continue to gradually improve over the next few months. As a reminder, the fundamental catalyst for the current situation is the
surge in goods spending in the US and Europe relative to services
, an abnormal pandemic-related change that supply chains were not ready for. Combine the semiconductor intensity of Western goods imports with high levels of COVID restrictions in Asia, and you have the ingredients for a massive supply shock. As mRNA vaccination rates rise in Asia and community spread declines, a relaxation in worker density and other COVID protocols should follow.In the US, in-person spending on pandemic-sensitive services is recovering alongside oil and airline spending; the outlier is white collar office utilization rates, the most vaccine-resistant variable of all.
All things considered, we expect normalization of US and European goods spending relative to services in the months ahead, which should reduce physical bottlenecks further.US labor markets, however, may not normalize so quickly.
Company surveys show
all-time peaks regarding plans to raise worker compensation since they’re having trouble filling jobs, and regarding plans to raise prices. Wage increases are now eating into overall business optimism; historically, the chart on the lower right tends to track changes in S&P margins reasonably well, although not all the time.Where have all the workers gone?
That’s a good question. Let’s use estimates to add up all the workers missing from the labor force since the pandemic began.
1
The impact of COVID unemployment (UI) benefits on labor force participation is still unclear. While benefit expiration in July and August led to an increased job finding rate among unemployed workers, it did not lead to higher labor force participation. In any case, let’s start with the estimated number of
people receiving UI benefits as of September 1 that exceeded their prior salaries
(2.7 million out of 5.3 million UI recipients)
During the pandemic,
1.5 million more people retired than usual
compared to what was a steady linear trend beforehand. There’s some research indicating that rising stock markets and housing prices boost retirement rates, but the sudden spike in retirements starting in March 2020 suggests that COVID is the main catalyst hereVisas granted to immigrants and non-immigrant temporary workers
collapsed during the pandemic. While visas are starting to recover, the pandemic decline resulted in ~700,000 people missing from the labor supply. Visa shortfalls during the pandemic add to a backlog of around 1 million people waiting to receive employment-based visas. More immigration data: highly educated immigrants who qualify for green cards wait an average of 16 years before receiving them. Also: Trump cut the number of family preference green cards, which increased availability of employment-based green cards by 122k. But only 40k were granted by the September 30 deadline; the rest may be lost for good absent Congressional action
An
increase in self-employment
also plays a role. While such individuals are still in the labor force, self-employment spiked by 800,000 once the pandemic hit. The largest job switching categories:
people leaving manufacturing and agriculture for construction and transportation
(i.e., ride-hailing). So, the shortages you read about regarding goods and food production are in part attributable to this trendEveryone else
. Another 1.7 million people left the labor force during the pandemic for reasons other than those stated above. This category includes:
Some of the 3 million respondents to a September Census household survey saying that
concerns about getting or spreading COVID
are why they’re not working (this is around half the pre-vaccine level from 2020, but still a large number)
Some of the 4 million people citing
child care constraints
in the same survey, even after the reopening of schools (i.e., people not working due to providing care for children not in school or daycare). This figure declined by roughly half once schools opened in SeptemberAccording to BLS surveys and our estimates, ~2 million people out of the 7.5 million missing workers intend to search for work again at some point, and we do expect increased labor supply by year-end.
But it might not be enough to restore the pre-COVID balance of supply and demand in the labor market, which was already pretty tight. As a result, wage pressures and labor shortages may be an endemic feature of the post-COVID US economy and put pressure on the Fed by the middle of next year
. Note: on the issue of job mismatches, the latest data suggest that this is more of a geographical problem than an industry problem right now, with the largest worker shortfalls relative to vacancies in North Carolina, Georgia, Indiana and Wisconsin.
By the way, the Fed staff and FOMC participants revised up their near-term inflation forecasts but continue to expect inflation to moderate in 2022. The staff forecasts that inflation will fall back below 2% in 2022 and only return to 2% in 2024.
I disagree with them
. As a reminder, Fed forecasts for policy rates ended up being wrong for most of the last decade:Help Wanted, Part 2: The era of a possible US defense umbrella over Taiwan has long since passed
The market cap of the World Semiconductor Index finally surpassed the market cap of the World Energy Index in 2020, an indication of a world that’s more reliant each year on technology.  Taiwan has the largest global share of semiconductor capacity at 21%, including a 50% share of higher value added logic chip capacity; and Taiwan’s TSMC has a market cap that is more than double Intel.  The likely US response to any actions by China that constrict Taiwanese semiconductor supply would be a lengthy and expensive effort to rebuild US semiconductor production capacity (now just a 12% share), rather than a defense of Taiwan itself
.
A lot of clients have asked about Taiwan given increased sabre-rattling by China. The latest: China sent a record number of jets into Taiwanese air space, President Xi said that complete reunification of the motherland “must and will be fulfilled”, and also warned that the Chinese people have a glorious tradition in opposing separatism. Taiwan’s defense minister said that tensions with China are at their worst in 40 years.
To be clear, the US is not obligated by treaty to defend Taiwan from attack
. A Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty was put in place in 1955 and did obligate the US to defend Taiwan, but this treaty was abrogated permanently by the US in 1979 in exchange for China establishing diplomatic relations with the US, and Chinese support for American actions in Communist Afghanistan (when the US was arming the Afghan mujahideen). The Sino-US mutual defense treaty was replaced by the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, which instead obligates the US to provide Taiwan with “sufficient defense capabilities”. While US arms sales to Taiwan of $11 billion in 2019 were the highest on record, this may not amount to much if a military conflict occurs.
After normalizing for wage differences and purchasing power, China’s military spending is ~90% of US levels. As part of a special section in this year’s Outlook, I spoke with the author of a RAND Corporation report on Chinese military capabilities.
The RAND analysis indicates that China has changed the balance of power in the region, substantially eroding the ability of the US military to defend Taiwan even if it chose to
.
The second chart below shows
the evolution of US air superiority against Chinese surface to air missile systems. The area above and to the left of each curve represents RAND estimates of how often US forces would prevail as a function of US aircraft missile range and detectability. For example, in 1996, only highly detectable US aircraft with shorter range missiles would lose in battle. By 2017, US aircraft needed to be much less detectable and more weaponized due to improvements in Chinese air defense systems. Similar findings: the share of Chinese ships destroyed by US submarines in a 7 day campaign scenario fell from 100% in 1996 to 40% by 2017, and the estimated US air force fighter wing capacity required to defeat China in an attrition battle rose by 7x. Since the RAND publication was released, China has added more destroyers, cruisers, aircraft carriers and assault ships; hypersonic and intermediate range missiles; anti-submarine warfare; and long range bombers.See Appendix for additional semiconductor facts and figures
Help Wanted, Part 3: Highly indebted states are still going to need help, even with improved solvency ratios
COVID has not turned into the municipal disaster that many feared a year ago. State revenues have been more resilient than expected, and according to the National Association of State Budget Officers, 38 states reported FY2021 general fund revenues above initial forecasts. The March 2020 CARES Act provided $150 billion to state and local governments; another $125 billion was authorized in December 2020; and in March 2021, Biden’s American Rescue Plan made another $350 billion available to states and local entities. From a big picture perspective,
a lot of state and local financial burdens were shifted onto the Federal government.
While less explicit than a Federal bailout of underfunded pensions, the 2020/2021 acts were still wealth transfers from citizens of less indebted states to citizens of highly indebted states.
That said, we wanted to take a look at the most indebted states right before COVID began (which is the latest data available from state consolidated annual financial reports)
. As a reminder, our IPOD ratio looks at the share of state revenues required to service bonded debt and to amortize all unfunded pension and retiree healthcare obligations over the next 30 years assuming a discount rate/investment return of 6%. As you can see below, most ratios improved since our last analysis in 2017, some substantially.
The reasons for improved ratios differ by state and include rising asset values, tax increases, reductions in retiree healthcare plan coverage, a cap on salaries used for pension accruals and contributions to underfunded plans (see Appendix for more details). The Illinois improvement is impressive; but how many times can you increase state taxes on companies and individuals? In 2020, Illinois recorded its 7
th
straight year of population loss, the most since World War II and the second largest of any state in raw numbers or % of population. Illinois is the only state whose population loss accelerated each year for the past seven years.
The bottom line: highly indebted states (most of which are controlled by DEM legislatures and governors) still have to dedicate almost a third of state revenues to unfunded pension and retiree healthcare obligations
2
despite
the best of all possible market environments to drive asset values higher. While financial repression and Federal transfers have given these states a reprieve, a diversified municipal portfolio is still highly recommended for residents of these states, even at the expense of paying state taxes on out-of-state bonds.Appendix
Semiconductor facts and figures [SIA Semiconductor Factbook, IC Semiconductor Research, TrendForce]
Semiconductor categories include microprocessor and logic devices (42% of sales); memory storage devices (25% of sales); devices that translate light, voice and touch analog signals into digital signals (13% of sales); and discrete optoelectronics and sensors generally used to generate or detect light
While the US has 47% market share of global semiconductor revenues, only ~40% of US production capacity is located in the US.  The rest is located in Singapore, Taiwan, China, Europe and Japan
Taiwan has the highest share of semiconductor capacity at 21%, followed by Korea at 20%, Japan and China at 15% and the US at 12%.  Taiwan also a 50% share of higher value added logic chip capacity
Taiwan also controls 60% of the semiconductor foundry market by revenue, which refers to outsourced semiconductor production (for companies like AMD, Apple, Qualcomm, Nvidia and Huawei)State specific catalysts for changes in municipal IPOD ratios, FY2017 to FY2020
Illinois: a state personal tax increase from 3.75% to 4.95% and a corporate tax increase from 5.25% to 7.00% helped propel revenues higher by 44%. Furthermore, pension service costs declined due to a cap on the salary used for state pension accruals
New Jersey: large decline in current pension service costs due to changes in benefit terms (interest credited for first two years of time period from termination to retirement instead of the entire period); reduced health care plan coverage terms
Hawaii: Revenues increased by 10% annually, more than the median state and much faster than pension payments growth
Kentucky: Large decline in current period service costs for the Kentucky Teachers Plan (for reasons that are not entirely clear)
Pennsylvania: Faster revenue growth than pension payments growth, and reductions in OPEB plan coverage
West Virginia: A State Senate bill now requires the state to make a large annual contribution to the state retiree healthcare plan (which boosted the funding ratio from 21% to 38%)1

While unfunded pensions are not explicitly cross-defaulted with general obligation bonds, our research indicates that in almost every case when pensions or retiree healthcare obligations were restructured by cities, bondholders suffered writedowns that were just as large or even greater. Examples include Central Falls RI, Harrisburg PA, Vallejo CA, Jefferson County AL, San Bernardino CA, Stockton CA and Detroit MI.Line chart shows the surge in US goods spending, shown as the difference in rolling 5-quarter growth rates, calculated as the growth rate in goods minus the growth rate in services. Chart shows that since the 1950s, the growth rate of goods relative to services has remained between -10% and 5-10%. However, the growth rate surged to 20% in 2021.Line chart shows the surge in Europe goods spending, shown as the difference in rolling 5-quarter growth rates, calculated as the growth rate in goods minus the growth rate in services. Chart shows that since 2002, the growth rate of goods relative to services has remained between -4% and 2%, however it surged to nearly 14% in 2021.Chart shows lockdown stringency vs vaccination rates for developed and emerging market countries. Lockdown stringency is shown on the y-axis as an index, where 100 represents the highest level of lockdown. Unique people vaccinated as a % of the population is shown on the x-axis. Chart shows how COVID restrictions in many Emerging Market regions remain high as vaccination rates are low. In developed countries like the US and Sweden, restrictions are lower as vaccination rates are higher.Line chart shows the container freight rate from China to LA/West Coast shown in US$ per 40ft box and anchored containerships since January 2019. While the freight rate remained around $2,000 per 40ft box since 2019, in late 2020 the freight rate began increasing. The Freightos China to West Coast freight rate steadily increased to just over $20,000 per 40ft box, though it has recently declined to around $17,000. The WCI Shanghai to LA index increased to its latest value of around $13,000. Anchored containerships have also steadily increased from historically low levels, with around 60 containerships anchored at the latest point in October.Line chart shows social distancing spending (card present transactions only) shown as the spending change vs 2019. In early 2020, the change in spending vs 2019 declined to -70%. Since then, it has steadily increased to its latest value at around 10% above its 2019 level.Line chart shows office utilization rates by metro area based on keycard/fob data. Utilization rates for all cities fell from 100% to 10-20% in early 2020. Since then, utilization rates have steadily increased. Cities in Texas (Austin, Houston, Dallas) have seen utilization rates increase to around 50%, while Philadelphia, DC, LA, Chicago, NYC, San Jose, and San Francisco have utilization rates between 20-35%.Line chart shows small business with hard to fill job openings, shown as the % of small business survey respondents. Since 1985, the % of businesses with hard to fill job openings has oscillated between 10% and 40%. However, recently this percentage has increased to 50% in September 2021.Line chart shows US small businesses raising worker compensation, shown as the % of small business survey respondents. Chart shows that the % of businesses has generally remained between 0% and 25%, but as of September 2021 has risen to 30%.Line chart shows the net percentage of small business survey respondents planning to raise prices from 1990 to 2021. Current levels are at all-time highs.Line chart shows the small business optimism index less firms planning to raise wages on the left axis and the % forward EBIT margin change over the last 12 months on the right axis. Optimism – planned wage increases can be used as a proxy for margins expectations and implies a decline over the next 12 months.Bar chart shows that about 2.7 million people have exited the labor force as a result of earning more from unemployment benefits than in prior jobs.Bar chart shows that there are about 1.5 million people who have retired in excess of the normal amount, thus exiting the labor force, in addition to the 2.7 million people earning more from unemployment benefits than in prior jobs.Bar chart shows that there has been a decline of about 700,000 temporary worker and immigrant visas, resulting in a cumulative worker shortage of 4.9 million people.Bar chart shows that there has been an increase of about 800,000 self-employed workers, resulting in a cumulative worker shortage of 5.7 million people.Bar chart shows that there has been an increase of about 2.7 million other labor force departures, resulting in a cumulative worker shortage of 7.4Line chart which shows the amount of workers who are currently planning on re-entering the labor force. The chart shows that more than 6 million workers are looking for a job.Chart shows the Fed projections vs actual Fed funds rate, shown as two series: the median FOMC projection of the Fed Funds rate (at each FOMC meeting) and a series showing the effective Fed funds rate. The chart shows that the median FOMC projection of the Fed Funds rate has been consistently higher than the effective funds rate since around 2018.Stacked bar chart which shows China and US military spending broken out by category. The chart includes spending on hardware, structures and personnel. China’s defense budget as reported is around $150 billion, significantly lower than the US budget of $500 billion. However, after adjusting China’s defense budget for PPP and US wage levels the budget is closer to $475 billion.Line chart which illustrates modeled estimates of US aircraft vs Chinese air defense systems over time. The chart shows predicted outcomes for 1996, 2003, 2010 and 2017 based on the aircraft’s weapon range and the detectability of the aircraft by Chinese radar systems. Anything above/left of the line indicates that the US aircraft would win and anything below/right of the line indicates that the Chinese air defense system would win. For example, in 1996 aircrafts would win with short range weapons (below 50 km) and high levels of detectability, whereas in 2017 US aircraft need to have very low levels of detectability or very long range weapons (150-200km) in order to win.Stacked bar chart which shows the % of state revenues required to pay the sum of interest on net direct debt, the state’s share of unfunded pension and retiree healthcare liabilities and defined contribution plan payments assuming a 6% return and 30 year level dollar amortization versus what the states are currently paying as of 2017 and 2020. Most of the states included need to pay a much higher % of revenues under our assumptions versus what they are currently paying. However, most states have made improvements over the last three years.Line chart which shows semiconductor manufacturing capacity by region as % of global capacity. The chart includes China, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, US and Europe since 1990 with estimates from 2021-2030. The chart shows that as of 2020, Taiwan has the highest share of global capacity at 21% and Europe has the lowest at ~9%.Line chart which shows the market capitalization of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Intel since 2004. In 2004, Intel was 5x larger than TSMC. However, since then TSMC has grown much faster than Intel and the two companies has similar market caps in 2017. TSMCs market cap has tripled since 2007 to more than half a trillion dollars, more than double that of Intel.FEMALE VOICE :

MR. MICHAEL CEMBALEST:
Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Eye on the Market podcast for October. Last time, we looked at the semiconductor vehicle and other goods' bottlenecks, which we expect to resolve themselves in the month ahead. We interpret declining business surveys that we're seeing right now as the result of a temporary supply shock and not a sign of inadequate demand. As a result, we think growth will pick up next year, and a bunch of cyclical and energy positions should benefit from that.
However, while the goods' bottlenecks will probably dissipate, we're looking at extremely tight labor markets and rising wages that I don't think are going to clear up so quickly and that are also at odds with current fed policy.
So, on the first page of today's note, we take a look at really the fundamental catalyst for the weird situation that we're in right now, which is the surge in goods' spending relative to services in both the U.S. and Europe. In other words, once the pandemic hit, people started buying a lot more stuff than services.  That stuff tends to be very semiconductor intensive, and then you've got a massive supply shock, given the degree to which goods spending is highly reliant on imports from Asia, where the lower vaccination rates and lower efficacy of the Chinese vaccines have led to more severe worker density protocols and things like that. But, again, over the next few months, we expect those things to dissipate.
What is not going to dissipate so quickly, however, are the tightness in U.S. labor markets. Some of the surveys are off the charts in terms of difficulty filling jobs, plans to raise worker compensation, wages, wage increases eating in to overall business optimism.
In today's note, we walk through where all the workers have gone, or a list of the categories, with respect to workers that have left the labor force. So, let's take you through them. The first big category is a controversial one, but it's the universe of workers who, at least as of early December, had been receiving, for some period of time, benefits that were higher than their prior salaries. So, this number is estimated to be between 2.5 to 3 million people. Now, those excess benefits are coming to an end right now, but it may take some time before those people feel a full economic incentive to go back to work.  And, remember, as we discussed last time, the foreclosure and eviction moratoria are still in place in a lot of cities and states around the country.
You've also got about 1.5 million people, more than usual, that retired during the pandemic. It was a pretty steady linear trend beforehand. But, about 1.5 million people left the labor force and retired. There's some research that rising stock markets and housing prices allowed them to do that. But, when you look at the timing of when those retirements occurred, COVID was the primary catalyst for making them quit in the first place, or retire in the first place.
Then, you've got about several hundred thousand people, at least, maybe almost a million, of missing immigrants and non-immigrant temporary workers.  VISAs granted to them collapsed during the pandemic, and while some of those VISAs are starting to recover, there's a huge hole in the labor force from all of those VISAs that weren't given for such a long period of time.
There's a lot of strange things going on in the immigration system. Trump had cut the number of family preference green cards, and that simply increased the availability of something called employment-based green cards, but only around a third of them were granted by the September 30
th
deadline, and the rest may be lost for good, if Congress doesn't act.
Another category is an increase in self-employment. While these people are still in the labor force, around 800,000 people left things like manufacturing and agricultural jobs for individual construction jobs and ride hailing. So, when you read about shortages in goods and food production, part of it's attributable to this increase in self-employment.
Then, the last category is a hodgepodge of 1.5 million people that left the labor force for all sorts of other reasons. Some of them because they can't get childcare, even with schools reopening, some of them because they're concerned about getting COVID. 3 or 4 million people each have cited in some census surveys that those two things are affecting their ability and/or inclination to go back to work.
Now, about 1 to 2 million—if you add up all those categories, it's about 7 million. 1 to 2 million of those people are indicating that they plan to re-enter the labor force fairly quickly.  But, that said, you're still missing a few million people, and so we do expect an increased labor supply over the next few months, but it might not be enough to restore the pre-COVID balance of supply and demand in the labor market, which was already pretty tight.
So, wage pressures and labor shortages may be an endemic feature of the post-COVID economy and put a lot of pressure on the fed by the middle of next year, if we're looking at still a 0% funds rate and a 4-5% consistent wage inflation.
Now, by the way, the fed and both the staff and the FOMC participants expect inflation to moderate in 2022, and the staff is actually thinking that inflation will fall below 2% next year. I disagree with them, for all of the obvious reasons.
The second topic this week is Taiwan. It fits in the Help Wanted scheme, because there's a lot of presumption that the U.S. would help Taiwan in any kind of military conflict with China. I don't think that's the case, but let's go through the details. The reason everyone's so focused on this, the market cap of the world's semiconductor index is now higher than the market cap of the world energy index, in indication that the world's becoming a lot more reliant on technology than traditional energy, notwithstanding the energy supply issues that we're having right now, which we'll discuss in a future Eye on the Market.
Taiwan's TSMC has a market cap that's double, more than double, that of Intel.  So, there's a lot of focus right now on what happens to global semiconductor supply chains, with respect to this whole China-Taiwan issue. My perception is any developments, whether now or in the future, that constrict Taiwanese semiconductor supply would end up with a multi-pronged and costly and lengthy effort by the U.S. to rebuild its own semiconductor production capacity, rather than to defend Taiwan itself.
So, what's going on? Well, China has been sending a couple hundred jets in to Taiwanese air space. President Xi said that complete reunification of the motherland must and will be fulfilled, and he also warned the Chinese people have a glorious tradition in opposing separatism. Taiwan's defense minister said tensions with China are at their worst level in 40 years.
To be clear about this, the U.S. is not obligated by treaty to defend Taiwan.  There was, past tense, a Sino-American mutual defense treaty that was put in place in 1955, which obligated the U.S. to defend Taiwan. But, this treaty was abrogated permanently by the U.S. in 1979, in exchange for China establishing relations with the U.S. and also, believe it or not, in exchange for Chinese support for what the U.S. was doing in Afghanistan, where the U.S. was arming the Afghan Mujahidin.
Anyway, this Sino-U.S. mutual defense treaty was replaced by the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, and all that does is obligate the U.S. to provide Taiwan with ""sufficient defense capabilities."" Arms sales from the U.S. to Taiwan last year of $11 billion were the highest on record, but I don't think that's going to amount to very much, if a military conflict were ever to occur.
If you look at the data for China, and you adjust their military spending for wage and purchasing power, it's around 90% of U.S. levels.  Earlier this year, I spoke with the team at the Rand Corporation that specializes in analyzing the balance of power in the region, specifically China, Taiwan, and the U.S., and since 1996, China has radically changed the balance of power in the region. We have a couple of charts in here that show that, and we've written about this before.  Essentially, China has been investing in destroyers, cruisers, aircraft carriers, intermediate range missiles, antisubmarine warfare, long-range bombers, and what was in 1986 an almost impossible task for China to impose its will in a 7-14 day campaign to take Taiwan was, as of 2017, all of a sudden a 50-50 proposition, and the gap between China and Taiwan and the U.S. just continues to grow.
As one example, in 1996, around 100% of Chinese ships were estimated to be destroyed by U.S. submarines in a 7-day campaign, and that number is now less than 40%. So, that's why, as far as I can tell, at least in my opinion, the most likely response that the U.S. would ever mount here would be some maybe military aid to Taiwan, but the more practical response would be to try to increase its current 12% manufacturing capacity for semiconductors up to some higher number.
The last topic for this week on Help Wanted refers to some of the highly indebted states in the United States that have not just a lot of bonds outstanding, but a large pile of unfunded retiree healthcare and pension obligations. These states got a lot of help from the federal government.  So, COVID hasn't turned in to the municipal disaster that many people, including me, feared that it might. Around 40 states are now reporting general fund revenues for 2021 above their initial forecast. And, if you add up the March 2020 CARES Act, an extension authorization of December 2020, and then the American Rescue Plan, there's something like $600-700 billion were transferred from the federal government to the states.  While less explicit than a federal bailout of underfunded pensions, the Acts from the last couple of years were essentially still wealth transfers from citizens of less indebted states to citizens of highly indebted states.
So, we wanted to at least take a look at the most indebted states right up until COVID began, which is he last data that's available from a lot of the state consolidated annual financial reports. Again, I think the data, as of right before COVID began, is probably a good proxy for where they are now, given all the aid that's been channeled to the states. And, we have this iPod ratio, where we look at the share of state revenues required to service debt and amortize all the unfunded pension retiree healthcare obligations over the next 30 years, using our assumed investment return of 6% on diversified defined benefit plan portfolio.
So, as shown in the chart, almost all the ratios have improved substantially since our last analysis. Why wouldn't they have? Asset values for public and private equity have gone up a ton. And, as everybody knows, a lot of the municipal, state, and local plants are huge investors in private equity. There have been some tax increases. There have been reductions in retiree healthcare plan coverages, salary accrual caps, contributions to underfunded plans, etc., etc.
Now, the big, big mover here is Illinois. But, even after the tax increase that they passed, they're still looking at something like a third of all government revenue having to go to pensions. I don't think that's very sustainable, and Illinois also has just recorded its seventh straight year of population loss, and a population loss that's accelerating each year.
So, the bottom line for us is that the most indebted states, many of which, by the way, are controlled by democratic legislatures and governors, still have to dedicate almost a third of their revenues to unfunded pension and retiree healthcare obligations in order to service them, despite this very favorable market environment. I think financial repression and federal transfers have given these states a reprieve, but for residents of these states, a diversified municipal portfolio is still highly recommended here, even at the expense of having to pay state taxes on out-of-state funds.
So, that is the end of this week's Eye on the Market. Our next piece will be our Thanksgiving Eye on the Market, sometime in mid-November. Thanks for listening. See you soon.  Bye.

[1] Addictive Behaviors AN103 (Anatomy): The Prefrontal Cortex and External Stimuli
Students will explore the addictive consequences of Fed liquidity on the stock market now that the Fed is about to slow its asset purchases, and as the share of US equities more sensitive to liquidity conditions than to economic growth keeps rising. Background reading includes data on Treasury demand from foreign central banks that own 30% of the Treasury market, as well as Treasury demand from banks, pension funds and insurance companies for regulatory and liability management reasons; these demand sources may mitigate the impact of reduced Fed purchases on long term interest rates.[2] Mechanical Engineering ME89 (Engineering): Dynamics of coiled springs
Students will review Hooke’s Law

and its application to US growth, spending, inventories and inflation. Some leading indicators have weakened recently, a reflection of intense supply chain issues which include a temporary but pronounced semiconductor shortage
4
. However, look at the big picture: rising wages, government transfers and pandemic issues have boosted pent-up consumer spending, and there’s unprecedented pent-up demand when looking at the gap between low inventory growth and high sales growth. Both of these coiled springs will eventually spring back. So will housing, which is now constrained by soaring prices and the tightest supply conditions since 1990 (2-3 months). There’s consumer resistance to higher prices for durables, cars and homes, but ammunition for healthy US consumer spending is firmly in place particularly given improved household balance sheets.
As drags from supply constraints and the Delta variant eventually fade, US and global growth should be supported by reopening dynamics, inventory restocking and a lot more capital spending
.
While these dynamics all point to higher GDP growth as production rises to meet demand, it’s also hard to see how inventory vs sales gaps can be closed without higher prices as well. Many companies agree, as indicated by the all-time high 45% of small business respondents planning to increase prices.[3] Military Strategy HS233 (History): The Art of War
Students will learn how tech and communication services companies conquered US equity markets. Readings include David Autor’s “
The Fall of the Labor Share and the Rise of Superstar Firms
” (MIT, 2019). Implications for investors include the superior risk-reward characteristics of growth equity and venture capital investments focused on software and other high-margin businesses with low labor intensity.
Industry concentration is at an all-time high and is attracting antitrust attention. But the tech/communications services opportunity set is much bigger than the 5 megacap firms: secular growth tech stocks we discussed in our 2021 Outlook are performing in line with the megacap stocks this year, and carry a lot less antitrust baggage. As long as wages are the largest component of overall business expenses (last chart), the corporate sector will look to tech companies to help reduce their unit labor costs and improve productivity. In other words, we expect strong demand for technology goods and services to continue, and do not expect any mean reversion in sector profit margins.[4] Chinese History CH04 (History): The Creation of a More Just Society
Students will review
The Great Leap Forward
and
The Cultural Revolution
as prior examples of Chinese leaders imposing sacrifices in the pursuit of societal goals. Many Chinese stocks have been clobbered after new rules and critical gov’t commentary on the internet
5
, e-commerce, for-profit tutoring, data sharing, overseas equity listings, cryptocurrency, online finance, real estate, labor practices, anti-trust and competition, drug prices, food product disclosure and corrosive Western decadence such as celebrity-watching, social media and gaming.
Since the Chinese government described online gaming as “spiritual opium”, students will also revisit materials on the Opium Wars of the 1840’s and its consequences: a proliferation of drug addicts and opium dens, a surge in corruption and other criminal behavior, a breakdown in public morality and an exodus of silver shipped abroad by addicts. Around 25% of China’s adult males were addicted to opium, a level of mass addiction not equaled by any nation before or since
6
. From 1820 to 1870, China’s share of global output fell in half, from 33% to 14%.
For long term investors with patience, there are some attractive opportunities here, but selectivity is key
. Despite the large selloff in Chinese equities, the valuation gap vs the US shown in the last 2 charts is not as large since China traded at higher multiples before the crackdown began. We use enterprise value to projected free cash flow to minimize the impact of regional accounting differences and to capture the impact of new rules on future company profits, even though it is probably too early to expect analysts to fully adjust their forecasts.[5] Progressivism in Film FA08 (Arts): Raiding the Temple Granaries
Students will re-enact one of the most progressive scenes in film history: when Moses raids the temple granaries in Cecil B DeMille’s
Ten Commandments
. The class will then pivot to the current Administration’s progressive plans to raise corporate taxes to pay for infrastructure and other initiatives (clean energy and EV subsidies, child care, family leave, pre-K education and Obamacare premium expansion). At the time this syllabus was prepared, Democrats had not reconciled their competing visions.
The most likely scenario is an infrastructure bill with ~$1 trillion in new spending and a reconciliation bill with ~$2 trillion in new spending
.
Students will review the base case scenario for corporate taxes: 25% corporate tax rate (up from 21%); an increase in the effective tax rate applied to low tax jurisdictions from 13% to 18%-19% (GILTI tax); a minimum book tax of 15% on large US companies that is unlikely to have much bite given prevailing effective tax rates (see second chart); and partial commingling of foreign tax credits.
The bottom line is a modest 5% hit to 2022 S&P earnings per share, with slightly higher tax hikes for tech, healthcare and communication services
. While the tax impact on S&P earnings appears modest, students will review the overall cost of the two bills (including tax increases on individuals and pass-through entities), which is large compared to tax bills in the post-war era; see third chart “infrastructure + negotiated reconciliation bill” and fourth chart on marginal effective corporate tax rates across countries, and the impact of the proposed bills.
Note from the Dean
: we cannot guarantee film majors anything resembling a viable financial future; you will have to hit the jackpot. One example: recent film graduates of Columbia University who took out student loans had median debt of $181,000, and two years after earning master’s degrees, half earned less than $30,000 a year. Recent Columbia film alumni had the highest debt compared with earnings among graduates of any major university master’s program [WSJ, “

After discussing Erica Jong’s 1973 second-wave feminist novel
Fear of Flying
, students will analyze consumer reactions to the Delta variant, which so far also indicate a revived fear of flying
7
. Other social distancing categories such as bars, restaurants, lodging, parks and theaters are starting to decline as well, but not by nearly as much. As a result, the sharp decline in “COVID recovery” stocks shown in the third chart might represent an interesting opportunity as the Delta variant eventually fades and booster shots rise. While social distancing spending indicates that Americans are circulating and spending in large pre-pandemic numbers, they’re still demonstrating a pronounced aversion to office settings as shown in the last chart.
On aviation, challenges are not just a fear of flying but electronic means for companies to now avoid it.
A Bloomberg survey showed 84% of companies expect to spend less on aviation, with budget declines of 20%-40%. While corporate customers normally only represent 12% of seats, they can represent as much as 75% of airline profits. Hotels could see revenue declines of 15%-20% as virtual meetings replace one quarter of corporate travel volumes (mostly internal non-client trips). A Conference Board survey cited reduced business travel as the most likely long term impact of the pandemic.[7] Fundamentals of Organisms BIO50 (Biology): Natural Selection and its rare deviations
Students will review examples of natural selection (peppered moths, rat snakes, Galapagos finches, warrior ants) and rare examples of
reverse
natural selection
, in which species adapt behaviors that are contrary to their own survival. Examples of the latter include COVID vaccine-resistant communities in the United States, where hospitalizations are rising sharply for unvaccinated people and for younger people as well. US hotspot mortality rates are now the highest in the world, alongside Malaysia and Iran, and are 10x higher than mortality rates in the rest of the developed world. Of US states, Florida now has the highest mortality rate, edging out Mississippi and Louisiana.[8] Poetry PY51 (English): Emily Dickinson and mortality
Students will analyze Dickinson’s famous poem “
Because I could not stop for death
”. For most vaccinated people, you won’t have to either, at least based on the latest vaccine efficacy data. While there is evidence of declining vaccine efficacy over time, such data has to be analyzed carefully to avoid an amalgamation paradox which can produce misleading results when applied to heterogeneous populations with “hidden” variables that explain results more accurately
8
. In the case of COVID, the hidden variable is age.
The most useful efficacy information comes from studies with data on specific age groups
. As shown below, age-specific data from Israel and the UK show that efficacy vs hospitalization and severe infection remain high vs the Delta variant (85%-95%); results for total populations in these studies is misleading (red shaded values due to the paradox cited above). Even so, as with other vaccines, COVID appears to require a three shot regimen for maximum efficacy. I recommend getting a booster as soon as you are eligible: early evidence from Israel shows a 10-fold reduction in infection risk with a booster shot compared to a 2-shot regimen, and shows an increase in implied Pfizer efficacy against severe infection for people aged 60+ from 80% to 93%.1

The semiconductor shortage
. Most chip shortages are related to older and simpler 200-mm silicon wafers used in cars, computers, monitors, laptops, TVs, refrigerators and washing machines. Demand for many of these items soared during the pandemic as people built out home offices and related projects. There’s limited economic incentive to build new 200-mm chip plants given wafer-thin margins; only a handful of new ones are planned for 2022. Even so, there’s a few billion dollars being invested to expand capacity by ~20% in existing plants, in which case the semiconductor squeeze should start to ease by Q2 2022. Auto manufacturers are also discussing longer term contracts with Tier 2 suppliers that might incent them to build out new 200-mm capacity. A by-product of the semiconductor shortage: Ford is offering customers faster delivery if they agree to “lower feature content”, which translates into fewer semiconductors.

Fed purchases were $120 billion in Q2 2021, and are expected to be $120 billion in Q3 and Q4 2021. Purchases are expected to decline to ~$95 billion in Q1 2022, ~$55 billion in Q2 2022, and ~$25 billion in Q3 2022. No purchases are expected from Q4 2022 onwards.Line chart shows US equity market sensitivities since 1970, shown as the share of US equities. Line chart shows that over 50% of US equities were highly sensitive to economic growth from 1970, but the share began declining in the early 2000s to its most recent level of just under 40%. The chart also shows the share of US equities highly sensitive to liquidity, which steadily increased from around 5% in 1970 to 15% in the late 1990s, then spiked to 45% in 2000 but declined to 20% by the early 2000s.

MR. MICHAEL CEMBALEST:
Good morning, students. This is your dean speaking. We look forward to seeing you back on campus, although you're not going to be allowed to gather in large groups, which we think will reduce COVID transmission and also cut down on all of your excessive drinking. Since most of you experienced declining grades last year, we've doubled your coursework and so your syllabus is going to be eight classes this semester instead of four. One brief update to the syllabus, the course, the Origins of COVID that was supposed to be taught by Professor Peter Daszak has been cancelled until further notice.
Anyway, here's a quick overview of the eight courses in your syllabus for this fall. The first one is on addictive behaviors and the prefrontal cortex and external stimuli, where we're going to look at the consequences of Fed liquidity on the stock market. Fed's about to slow it to asset purchases, and the share of U.S. equities that are very sensitive to liquidity conditions keeps rising. There's still a lot of demand for long-duration Treasury from banks, pension funds, and insurance companies for regulatory reasons and liability management, but we will have to explore over the next few months the implications of reduced liquidity on the stock market.
One of the most important courses you'll be taking this fall is the Dynamics of Coiled Springs in the Mechanical Engineering Department and its application to U.S. growth, spending, and inventories. So some leading indicators have weakened recently, mostly a function of really intense supply chain problems, including a semiconductor shortage that's very pronounced and may not resolve until early next year.
But if you look at the big picture, rising wages, government transfers, and pandemic issues of boosted pent-up consumer spending, and so, and there's also a lot of unprecedented pent-up demand when you look at the gap between low inventory growth and high sales growth, both of these coiled springs will eventually come back and so will housing, which is now constrained by soaring prices and very tight supply conditions.
So the bottom line is as drags from the supply constraints and the Delta variant eventually fade, U.S. and global growth should be supported by a bunch of reopening dynamics, inventory restocking, and more capital spending. That said, in the near term, it's hard to reconcile inventory and sales gaps and how they could be closed without higher prices, which is why so many companies are indicating that they are planning to increase prices at this point.
On the semiconductor shortage, just a few comments. Most of the chip shortages are related to these older, simpler, 200-mm silicon wafers that are used in cars and computers, laptops, refrigerators, and washing machines. Demand for these items soared during the pandemic as people built out home offices and other related projects. And so the problem is there's not a lot of economic incentive to build these new plants. Their margins are wafer-thin, sorry for the pun, and only a handful of new ones are planned for next year. Even with that, there's a few billion dollars being invested to expand capacity by around 20% in existing plants, which should start to soften some of this shortage by Q2 of next year.
The third course you'll be taking is on military strategy and the art of war, and you will be focusing on how the tech and communication services companies have conquered U.S. equity markets. When you look at industry concentration and margins, the tech and communications services opportunities, that is really where most of the gains have been. And there are some important applications here you can read about for investors that translate into much better risk/reward characteristics for growth, equity, and venture capital investing for the software and other high-margin businesses with very low labor intensity. So you can take a look at that.
We have a course in Chinese history on the creation of a more just society, where you'll be reviewing the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution as examples of how Chinese leaders in the past imposed sacrifices in the pursuit of broader societal goals. A lot of Chinese stocks have been clobbered after new rules on everything from e-commerce, tutoring, data sharing, crypto, online finance, labor practices, antitrust, drug prices, food disclosures, and then of course these corrosive Western practices such as celebrity-watching, social media, and gaming.
For investors that have patience, there are some attractive opportunities here. They're not massive across all sectors, even with the large selloff in Chinese equities, and some of the categories are down 35% or so. The valuation gap versus the U.S. isn't that big because China started out trading at much higher multiples before this whole crackdown began. But there does seem to be some interesting opportunities here for very long-term investors, given the growth dynamics that are in China.
Another course you'll be taking is on progressivism in film. We're going to be looking at progressive scenes in film history and then pivoting to the Biden administration's progressive plans to raise corporate taxes to pay for infrastructure and other initiatives. Democrats haven't reconciled yet competing visions. Mansion and cinema have taken well-established positions of what they can and can't support or will and won't support. The most likely scenario to us is an infrastructure bill of about a trillion dollars in new spending and a reconciliation bill for all the other stuff, with around 2 trillion in new spending. And that's as high as I think they'll be able to go.
The base case scenario for corporate taxes to me doesn't look nearly as bad as it could have been. But to tax policy experts, they're disappointed because part of what the Trump tax bill accomplished was to level the playing field with other countries for U.S. multinationals. And we've got some charts in here showing how what's likely to come out of this will push the U.S. to the back of the line again in terms international tax competitiveness. It looks like a 25% corporate rate up from 21, an increase in the effective tax rate applied to low-tax jurisdictions, currently around 13, that would go up to 18 or 19, a minimum book tax of 15% on large companies, although that's not going to have much of an impact, given since most of them pay more than that anyway.
The bottom line is around a 5% hit to next year's earnings per share, with slightly higher tax rates for the tech, healthcare, and communications services sectors. To me, this appears modest. And again, when you compare it to the overall Biden agenda, this could have been much worse when you look at what the original plans were again. But that said, this is a large bill from an international perspective. And also, once you throw in all the individual tax rates, this is, it looks like one of the largest tax increases in the post-war era, not anywhere near what took place in 1951 or 1968, but bigger as a share of GDP than almost all of the other bills that have taken place over the last few decades. Anyway, we'll take a look at the data here. You can take a look.
And then the last three courses are all COVID-related. One of them is on a fear of flying, where we take a look at consumer reactions to the Delta variant. So far, airline spending is where we're really seeing the brunt of it. We're seeing much smaller reductions in social distancing spending related to bars, restaurants, lodging, parks, theaters, et cetera. So the sharp decline in some of these COVID recovery baskets of stocks could be an interesting opportunity. But again, most of what we're seeing here is airline-related.
And the other problem, the other thing with the airline spending is hard to disentangle, it's not just the Delta variant, but companies now have electronic means through Zoom and other methods to avoid this kind of spending. Almost 5% of companies in one of these Conference Board surveys said they expect to spend less on aviation, with budget declines of 20 to 40%, which is a pretty big hit. And corporate customers only represent around 12% of all the seats, but they can represent as much as three-quarters of airline profits. This is going to have knock-on effects for hotels as virtual meetings replace corporate travel, mostly the internal non-client stuff. So this looks like the most pronounced long-term impact of the pandemic.
Just a couple more COVID-related courses. One of my favorites is on a biology course on natural selection and its rare deviations. You'll be reviewing examples of actual natural selection, peppered moths, rat snakes, warrior ants, things like that. And then examples of reverse natural selection in which species adapt behaviors that are contrary to their own survival, and the best example of that are vaccine-resistant communities in the U.S. where hospitalizations are rising very sharply for unvaccinated people and also for their younger unvaccinated people as well. The U.S. hotspots in the Southeast, the mortality rates, forget about discrepancies over how you measure an infection and what are people in the hospital for, mortality rates are now the highest in the world alongside Malaysia and Iran, and are ten times higher than the mortality rates in the rest of the developed world.
So there is that, and then we have a final course that looks at some of the vaccine efficacy statistics. You have to be very careful. I wrote about this in the last Eye on the Market. You have to be very careful when you're looking at this data. There's a very strange mathematical paradox that can happen when you're showing the overall efficacy result on a large population that is skewed by age. And so the studies that divide the efficacy numbers by age group are much more reliable. And this is kind of amazing. In one of the studies that came out on Pfizer, the overall efficacy number for the entire population was described as being 68%, whereas for the under-50 group it was 92, and for the over-50 group it was 85. So in other words, the headline number being reported in the press was grossly misleading because of this weird mathematical paradox. You can read more about it in the last Eye on the Market. But this time we have a table showing what the age-bucketed results are.
The bottom line is there does seem to be fading efficacy versus infection after a few months. But even so, efficacy against mortality, severe infection, ICU, and hospitalization still appears to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 90 to 92% across different studies and for all of the mRNA vaccines. The numbers are markedly lower for the AstraZeneca and the J&J vaccines by about 10 or 15%, depending on the study that you're looking at. So welcome back to school, and we will talk to you again next time, bye.

Our reflation outlook for the US and Europe in 2022 is alive and well despite a recent decline in leading indicators.
While many bottleneck measures are still elevated, we expect automobile semiconductor production to double by next summer compared to its recent pace; Eastbound freight rates highlighted in our September piece are finally dropping, along with a large decline in the Baltic Dry Index of shipping costs; we expect a return of ~2 mm people that left the US labor force by Q1 2022; and there are reports of falling backlogs and rising factory utilization rates in Asia as vaccination rates surpass 60% in Vietnam and Thailand, and surpass 70% in Malaysia and Taiwan
US and European GDP should get a boost as supply shortages eventually dissipate and as inventory levels are rebuilt from very low levels relative to sales, which are still holding up well; US infrastructure and reconciliation bill spending will boost output as well. We will explain more next time, but supply chain issues in the US are not just due to COVID and a surge in goods spending. LA and Long Beach ports rank #328 and #333 in the world in the IHS/Markit Container Port Performance Index for reasons related to working hours, resistance to greater automation, labor costs, Customs Office weekend closures, etc.
Despite supply constraints, US and European firms have posted another quarter of high margins, earnings and sales vs expectations (see table below). Also, it looks like top US statutory corporate tax rates will not rise, and that changes will include higher taxes on foreign income, a 15% minimum book tax and a 1% stock buyback tax. The net impact looks like a 3%-4% earnings hit to the profitable US tech sector, and at most a 1.0%-1.5% earnings hit to all other sectors
US labor shortages will persist, however, due to the US having one of the largest unvaccinated populations in the developed world, a COVID-driven surge in retirement, declining immigration etc. Wage-price spiral risks are rising as the Fed’s “inflation is transitory” stance seems more implausible each month.
China is the growth outlier, suffering a demand shortfall due to energy constraints, a regulatory purge, only modest easing of monetary and financial policy and among the strictest COVID protocols in the worldThe Thing

In all my years I never heard, seen, nor smelled an issue that was so dangerous it couldn't be talked about
”
Stephen Hopkins, Governor of Rhode Island and signatory to the Declaration of Independence,
1776
Until this year, I had never run into a topic that I couldn’t write about. Anything affecting markets, economics or growth was fair game, and a lot of controversial topics show up in the Eye on the Market archives since its launch in 2003. But now I have run into such a thing, and I still don’t think I can write about it. Origin stories have always been contentious, whether they’re related to religion, mythology or viruses.
Anyway, here’s a different topic that I can discuss
. There are some strange things going on in energy markets, with coal, natural gas/LNG, oil, gasoline, electricity and steel prices surging in many parts of the world. Massachusetts, California, Europe and China provide some cautionary tales below.Massachusetts:
in the progressive enclaves of the Northeast,
NIMBYism continues to kill decarbonization
. Maine has followed New Hampshire in blocking a high voltage transmission line needed to bring hydropower from Quebec to Massachusetts, requiring New England’s ISO to expand its reliance on natural gas instead.
California
has already experienced rolling blackouts due to power demand that exceeded planning targets, and that’s before the state decommissions 2,250 MW of nuclear power and 3,700 MW of natural gas fired power plants in the next couple of years. California has among the highest solar irradiance levels in the northern hemisphere, comparable to Southern Spain and Northern Africa; its offshore wind speeds are even higher than the Central Plains states; and its 1,800 MW of geothermal power represents 75% of US capacity, an indication of the state’s favorable geology. And yet California still imports power from adjacent states, although even this is now at risk as neighboring states shut down coal-fired plants whose generation was sold to California. The state plans to store excess renewable generation in utility scale batteries but this will take time, so the state approved the temporary use of four natural gas generators to alleviate the power shortage.
Europe
is facing a long winter with natural gas supplies 10%-15% below normal for this time of year. At the same time, Russia is offering only a small amount of gas to Europe to alleviate the crunch, and has only offered 15%-20% of 2019 spot market volumes to Europe for the years 2022 and 2023. A few reasons: last year, Russia had an unseasonably cold winter and its winter looks to be starting early this year; Russia was having trouble filling its own domestic natural gas reserves; Russia spent $11 billion on Nord Stream 2 and is trying to maximize returns on it by pressuring Europe to approve it; and Russia made it clear in advance that it prefers long term take-or-pay contracts rather than selling in the spot market. Surging European natural gas prices have resulted in industrial shutdowns: CF Industries announced closure of two UK ammonia/fertilizer plants and, more significantly, Yara announced a 40% cut to EU ammonia capacity. Yara/CF cuts are > 20% of European capacity and ~1-2% of global capacity.
China’s
energy crisis is complex but is another example of fossil fuel supply falling faster than demand. Contributing factors: a surge in Chinese power demand in 2021 as the global economy rebounded; lower China hydropower output which increased demand for coal fired power; a slowdown in China coal production due to climate goals, safety concerns and a coal price cap, leading to power plants running down coal inventories way below normal levels; disruptions in Indonesian coal exports due to heavy rains and domestic prioritization; and price controls in China’s power sector which prevent utilities from recovering rising input costs. China’s most recent interventions (price controls and production increases) have now halved the price of coal. However: domestic coal prices are still up 60% for the year, and coal inventories at power plants and ports are still 20%-40% below normal as winter approaches.Decarbonization would in theory eliminate some of these gyrations, so in the wake of COP26, by all means accelerate the transition to renewables
. Policy and shareholder initiatives are having an impact on the supply side, that’s for sure: there has been a 30%-40% collapse in global investment in energy-intensive industries like oil & gas, metals, mining, steel, etc. But as the economic, chemical, logistical and political realities that govern the demand side of the energy transition become clearer
1
, policymakers should be aware of the following:
If they reduce the
supply
of fossil fuels faster than they reduce
demand
for them, they run the risk of higher energy prices, energy dependence that can border on servitude and inadequate energy supplies that can lead to power rationing of homes and businesses
.The next chart shows energy dependence by region.
Look more closely at the details for Europe in the second chart:
Europe now imports around as much oil and gas from Russia as it produces for itself, and is desperate for more Russian gas this winter. How will this impact Europe’s response to a warning received from the US last week that Russia has concluded a lengthy troop build-up near the Ukraine and may be planning another invasion, or that Russia may also be preparing for intervention in Belarus
2
?The US does not face this kind of economic and geopolitical trap, but mounting pressure on investors and lenders to starve the US oil & gas industry of capital could eventually change that
3
. As
per our assumptions outlined in detail here
,
the US might need roughly the same amount of natural gas in 2035 as it uses today.
If that’s right, the only remaining questions are whether this energy is produced in the US or imported from Canada, Qatar and Russia, and how that affects reliability of supply, price and national security.Meanwhile, for investors, the fundamentals of traditional energy companies look quite different than they have in many years.
Capital spending has collapsed vs depreciation and cash flow, and the industry is earning record high free cash flow margins.
With that I wish all of you, and in particular Rachel
4
, a Happy Thanksgiving. See Appendix I for a brief comment on COVID, Europe and Aaron Rodgers.Appendix I: COVID, Europe and Aaron Rodgers
There has been a large COVID infection spike in Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. For the latter two countries, reported infections hit their highest levels since the pandemic began. It’s very early to make a final judgment, but high levels of European vaccination and improved health care protocols have sharply reduced the degree to which infection results in hospitalization and mortality (see table). If that pattern remains, the latest infection spike will have less severe healthcare and economic consequences for Europe. The efficacy of vaccines in preventing COVID from inhabiting the respiratory system seems to fade over time, particularly vs the Delta variant; that’s why infections occur even among vaccinated people. Even so, vaccine efficacy remains high in preventing the kind of pulmonary and neurological damage which puts people in the hospital (or worse).
Vaccine efficacy rates are not 100%, that is clear. But there’s plenty of data showing how US hospitalization and mortality rates are much higher among unvaccinated people; we have some on our COVID portal. The same is true in Germany, which has one of the largest unvaccinated populations in Europe (31%, same as the US), and where the unvaccinated are driving the surge: in its main pulmonary clinic in Giessen, patients have tripled, half are on ventilators and every single one of them is unvaccinated.
Even so, Green Bay Packers QB Aaron Rodgers rejected the premise that the US is experiencing a pandemic of the unvaccinated in a widely publicized interview, calling it “a total lie” before mentioning that he’s taking ivermectin (see box). If you want to listen to professional athletes, read Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s article
5
on Rodgers instead.What’s the story with ivermectin? It’s complicated
Simply dismissing ivermectin as a horse dewormer is not the right way to approach this. Ivermectin is a very effective drug for humans infected with certain parasites and its creators won the Nobel Prize in 2015. In the early stages of the COVID pandemic, ivermectin was among the thousands of compounds tested to see if it could stop the replication of the virus in vitro. It showed promise, so human trials began. Two meta-studies which aggregated results of individual trials found that the drug showed some promise.
But during the peer review process, the wheels came off the ivermectin train
: many studies were revealed to have design flaws, no control groups, biases, data errors and irregularities, and these tended to be the ones showing that ivermectin was effective vs COVID. The more robust studies generally did not find clear statistical evidence of its effectiveness. As a result, the FDA, WHO and European health agencies have advised against taking ivermectin unless it is being administered as part of an ongoing clinical trial.
Despite a lack of clinical evidence (like evidence supporting mRNA vaccines), some online groups advocate its use and in the US, ivermectin prescriptions are soaring.
Good luck with that
: when used for parasitic treatment, ivermectin is given as a one-time dose; the “ivermectin for COVID” crowd are often taking it twice a week even though there is no safety data on prolonged use. Some conspiratorial types argue that the drug industry is against ivermectin since it’s cheap; this argument doesn’t hold up since the steroid dexamethasone and the anticoagulant heparin are both inexpensive, and have been adopted for use against COVID after properly constructed clinical trials proved that they work.
One last clue about the ivermectin controversy: more than half of the people who believe ivermectin is effective have no plans to get vaccinated. I think that explains a lot as well.

Fringe Doctors Promote Ivermectin for COVID Despite Lack of Evidence

rising fossil fuel prices may not substantially boost US oil & gas production in a world of intense pressure on investors and lenders to divest.

FEMALE VOICE 1:  This podcast has been prepared exclusively for institutional wholesale professional clients and qualified investors only as defined by local laws and regulations. Please read other important information which can be found on the link at the end of the podcast episode.
MR. MICHAEL CEMBALEST:  Good afternoon and welcome to the Thanksgiving ""Eye on the Market"" podcast which I am recording from my basement.  I will explain that later.
So our inflation outlook for the U.S. and Europe is alive and well.  Some leading indicators have come down in large part because a lot of the bottleneck and supply chain issues.  Some of those issues are still elevated but we're starting to see the horizon loosening up a little bit.
We expect semi-conductor production for automobiles specifically to double by next summer.  Eastbound freight rates, which we've been talking about since September, are finally coming down.
A big decline in the Baltic Dry Index of shipping costs.  We expect around 2 million people in the U.S. that had left the labor force to return to the labor force.  Obviously smaller than the number of total people that left, but a meaningful bump.
And just as importantly, vaccination rates are now over 60 and 70 percent in Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and we're starting to hear of falling backlogs and rising factory utilization rates in Asia as some of these vaccination rates rise.  And specifically as they rise, increasingly based on the mRNA vaccines instead of the Chinese ones.
So as the supply shortages eventually dissipate, inventory levels will get rebuilt from low levels, and then early next year we should see a boost to U.S. and European GDP.  I think that's one of the reasons why the markets over the last couple months have been looking through some of these supply chain shortages and instead focusing on what looks like a pretty decent reflationary environment early next year.
Despite some of the – all these supply constraints, the U.S. and European firms have posted another very good quarter of high margins, earnings, and sales relative to expectations.
And on top of that, it's hard to say because the reconciliation bill in the U.S. still is being negotiated, but it looks like the top statutory corporate tax rate will not rise and instead we'll see increases in taxes on foreign income, a 15 percent minimum book tax, and a small stock buyback tax.
If you bake all the numbers in, it looks like about a 3 to 4 percent earning hit for the tech sector which is pretty profitable and just the one to one and a half earnings for the other sectors.  So bottom line is a lot smaller of a tax freight hit than it otherwise would have been.
Now, U.S. labor shortages on the other hand, unlike the good shortages, are going to persist.  The U.S. has one of the largest unvaccinated populations in the developed world.  Covid drove a big surge in retirement and we've had an immigration pause here that's pretty substantial over the last couple of years.
And as a result, if you look at the small business data, more companies are talking about raising prices of worker compensation in 30, 40 years.  It doesn't tell you necessarily the magnitude but it tells you about the frequency with which it's happening.
So there are some mini-wage price spiral risks that are here as a challenge to the Fed.  Their whole inflation transitory stance seems more and more implausible each month.
With respect to demand, which is holding up well in the West, China is the outlier.  China has got a demand shortfall because of a combination of energy constraints, a regulatory purge, only a modest easing of monetary and fiscal policy and some very strict Covid protocols.
But the bottom line here is that we are seeing some visibility on the supply chain issues and we expect a bounce in everything early next year - wages, prices, nominal GDP, et cetera.
So the Thanksgiving Eye on the Market is usually when I talk about a topic that people can discuss over holiday dinners.  The topic I wanted to write about, I can't write about.
Until this year I had -- I had never run into a topic I couldn't write about, and the firm has been very supportive of me writing about anything affecting markets, economics, growth; it was all fair game.
And there's a lot of controversial topics that show up in the Eye on the Market archives since we launched it in 2003.  But for the first time, I've run into something that I don't think I can write about and my guess is that you know exactly what topic I'm referring to and what my particular opinion about that topic is.
Anyway, here's a different topic that's interesting that -- that I can discuss.  There are some really strange things going on in energy markets.  Massachusetts, California, Europe, China, all provide different cautionary tales.
And if there's a common denominator here, they are all the byproduct of a 30 to 40 percent decline in investment in energy, metals, mining, and other energy intensive industries.
And I think for everybody that's focused on the decarbonization process, if you reduce the supply of fossil fuels faster than you reduce the demand for them, you're going to just end up with a combination of higher energy prices, more energy dependence on other places, and inadequate domestic supplies that can sometimes lead to power rationing of homes and businesses.
And so I know there's this intense focus on pressuring banks and institutional investors to starve certain industries of capital.  If that process goes faster than the process by which primary energy reduced -- consumption reduces reliance on oil and gas, you're going to end up with one leg moving faster than the other and you're going to end up with some issues.
We have a chart in here that shows energy dependence by region for the U.S., Europe, and China.  The U.S. is much less energy dependent on the rest of the world than Europe and China are for sure, but that could change.
And we walk through some of the issues here in Massachusetts.  NIMBY-ism continues to kill decarbonization.  Northeastern liberals love decarbonization but not if it comes at the expense of high voltage direct current lines to bring hydro power in from Quebec.
California is having rolling blackouts from time to time even before this state decommissions a couple of gigawatts of nuclear and a couple of gigawatts of natural gas.  Europe is facing a very long difficult winter.  Natural gas supplies are 10 to 20 percent below normal and Russia is only offering a token amount of help to alleviate that crunch.
And then you've got the whole energy crisis complex.  The energy crisis in China, which is complex, but which has to do a lot with its cutting both the supply of coal faster than they can decrease the demand for it.
So there's a chart in here, for example, showing how Europe imports around as much oil and gas from Russia as it produces for itself.  The -- that is a very unenviable economic and geopolitical position to be in.
The U.S. of course doesn't face anything like that, but again, mounting pressure on investors and lenders to starve the U.S. oil and gas industry of capital, um, could change some of these independents -- energy independence's balances.
We did an analysis.  I've been working on this for several years now and -- and there's a link here that goes into detail on the assumptions.  The U.S. might actually need the same amount of natural gas in 2035 roughly as it uses today.
And if that's right, the only remaining questions are whether that energy is produced in the United States or imported from Qatar, Russia, Canada, and places like that and how it all impacts the reliability of supply and price and national security.
If you're surprised that our analysis concluded that the U.S. is going to have roughly the same natural gas reliance in 2035 as it does today, go ahead and take a look at the link where we show a deep dive on our assumptions.
There's a lot of work you have to do on something like this and we spell out our assumptions.  If other people have very different views, I'd love to hear them.  We lay out our forecast for wind and solar capacity growth which is in the 90th percentile of capacity additions since 1960.
We lay out transmission growth estimates, wind and solar capacity factors for large footprints, what do we think is going to happen with coal fired plants, nuclear power plants, hydro power.  We have our estimates for electrification of passenger vehicles, light trucks and heavy trucks.
We even have some data in here on compressed natural gas penetration with trucks and buses.  We talk about our expectations for trend primary energy and electricity use.
And we even get into one of a cutting-edge topic which is what's going to happen with all of the municipalities that are pressuring commercial and residential buildings to move away from electric baseboard heating and fossil fuel combustion for heating and to heat pumps, and so we make assumptions about heat pump adoption as well.
And then lastly, we have some data in here on electrification of industry.  The bottom line is you have to lay out that entire complex of issues if you're going to make an assumption about what kind of natural gas reliance the U.S. is going to have in 2035.  Based on our analysis, it doesn't look that different in the future than it looks right now.
If that's the case, you have to think very carefully about starving that industry of capital because again, all you'll do -- are going to do is drive prices up and increase United States' dependence on other parts of the world.
I concluded the piece with a brief discussion of what's happening in Europe right now.  There's been a large Covid inspection -- infection spike in Belgium and Netherlands and Germany.
As a matter of fact, for Netherlands and Germany, the reported infections have hit their highest level since the pandemic began.  It's a little early to make a final judgment but I'm going to take a glass half full view here.
The high levels of European vaccination and some improved health care protocols have sharply reduced the degree to which Covid infections have resulted in hospitalization and mortality over time.  We have a table that shows those declining factors, both for Europe and the U.S.
If that pattern remains, the latest infection spike will be disruptive but have much less severe health care and economic consequences for Europe.  And if I had to summarize, it looks like the efficacy of vaccines in preventing Covid from inhabiting your respiratory system fade over time which is why we're seeing some vaccinated people actually get infected, particularly versus the Delta variant.
But even so, the vaccine efficacy remains really high in preventing pulmonary and neurological damage which is what puts people in the hospital or worse.
So again, the vaccines look to have some fading effectiveness against a respiratory infection that registers you as having Covid, but is not resulting in the -- in those more negative outcomes in hospitalization and mortality.
And there's plenty of data from multiple forces showing how hospitalization and mortality rates are much higher among unvaccinated people.  We actually have some of this on our Covid portal.
And so I was recuperating from surgery, which I'll talk about in a minute.  And I watched this Aaron Rodgers interview where he rejected the premise that the U.S. is experiencing a pandemic of the unvaccinated.  I think he called it a total lie before talking some nonsense about ivermectin.
Look.  This is willful ignorance.  The data is there if people just want to take a look at it.  And if you want to listen to professional athletes on Covid, you should read Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's article on what he thinks of Rodgers' arguments and logic instead.
So with all of that, I wanted to wish all of you a Happy Thanksgiving, and in particular Rachel.  Around three weeks ago, I had a freak accident while I was on a fishing expedition and got a tibial plateau fracture.
So I fractured my right knee and tore my meniscus.  And so Rachel has been taking very good care of me for the last three weeks and will be doing so for the next eight.  I expect to be walking again sometime in January and hopefully back in my kayak to fish again by April.
So Happy Thanksgiving, everybody, and I look forward to seeing many of you in the New Year.

MR. MICHAEL CEMBALEST:  Happy New Year, everybody, and welcome to the 2022 Eye on the Market Outlook, which is entitled Reflation Endgame.  I’ve never actually seen a superhero movie, but I can imagine what they look like, and I’ve seen the posters for them.  So the poster for this year, the cover art for this year’s Eye on the Market, is a group of superheroes, all of whom are contributing in one way or another to rising prices, wages, nominal growth, and asset prices.
And you take a look at the cover art, you’ll see politicians who are creating the largest monetary and fiscal stimulus on record, the impact from all the work-from-home employees that are driving up demand for import and semiconductor-intensive goods, which are worsening supply chain bottlenecks, the big jump in retirees taking advantage of rising home prices and rising 401(k) account values, working mothers, millions of whom are still having trouble finding childcare and the impact that has on the labor markets, the oil and gas and coal producers who have reverted into their shells, they’re depicted as turtles.
Capital spending in new projects for thermal power have fallen by 75%, even though the demand for thermal energy hasn’t really moved much at all.  We’ve got a vaccine resistor on the cover and the obvious impacts that has on the labor force, other labor force dropouts and switchers, healthcare regulators passing vaccine mandates, and then one of the other last but important impact on the labor market is about a million in the US missing immigrant workers in the US labor supply.  And that follows on the Trump era when immigration fell to its lowest level since the 1980s.
So all of these factors are part of the reflation endgame that’s the theme of this year’s Executive Summary, and we walk through the consequences for equity markets that are already pricing in plenty of good news.  The structure of the outlook is always an Executive Summary, and it gets followed by some specific investment topic discussions.  This year we review China and the regulatory purge and the prospect for investing there in 2022, what the landscape looks like for dividend investors, and then we take a look, a deep dive into some real asset topics, commercial real estate, office specifically, and the trends taking place there, infrastructure and timber.  We also look at investments in Fintech and cybersecurity.  And lastly, from a policy perspective, we look at ESG impacts on portfolios and what is now emerging is the pretty high cost of Brexit.
In the Executive Summary, we review the story that you’re all familiar with, with the COVID recession having recovered so quickly to eliminate spare capacity now at a faster pace than prior recessions.  We have global inflation close to the highest level in 20 years, which is driven by a number of things, surging goods prices, changing consumption patterns, the inability of adjusted time corporate sector to respond to that, soaring government debt and monetary policy that dwarfs anything we’ve ever seen.  And then energy policies which reduce the supply of thermal energy faster than they reduced demand.
And so as the year came to an end, we saw some weakening manufacturing indicators.  Normally that’s a negative sign for investors, but this time around, the supply chain shocks, I think, were more responsible for these weakening manufacturing indicators.  And that’s why we’re optimistic that with gradual resolution over some period of months of some of the supply chain delays, global growth is going to rebound.  And we’re already starting to see, in both the US and Europe, a shift back towards services from goods spending, which was one of the main catalysts for some of these supply chain problems.  We’ll see what happens as Omicron rolls through and it may be a temporary reversal.  But the bottom line is that the pig through the snake in terms of this surge in goods spending relative to services appears to be abating in the developed world.
Now, I won’t go into the details here, but we do have a page on some of the supply chain issues.  This is not just the byproduct of COVID and the shift in spending.  There’s a lot of structural issues in the US that are that are negatively affecting the supply chains in terms of local regulations.  I won’t go through them all here, but you’ve got to look at this page.  No port in the US ranks in the top 50 globally in terms of cost or more important, efficiency and speed.  These Los Angeles ports that you read about all the time rank 328 in the world, and Long Beach comes into 333.  There are contracts that prevent port automation.  There’s limits on operating hours; there’s weekend closures.  And the semi-automated Port of Virginia doesn’t have any backlogs and ranks, comes in at about 85.  But there’s a lot of issues here in the US that this supply chain stuff has surfaced, which are structural and not just cyclical.
Anyway, we walk through a lot of the usual suspects that we’re tracking regarding some of these supply chain issues, which are still obviously on the high side as we enter the year.  The question is how do they get resolved.  And if you look historically, there have been some pretty severe supply chain issues that have taken place in the past.  And normally what happens is they get resolved within a few months as capital spending catches up to demand.  And COVID is a complicating factor, but we expect that to happen this time as well.
A pretty good example of that is the, what now looks like a very large increase in automobile-related semiconductor capital spending, which is expected to double next year versus prior trends, and this is pretty critical for supply chain given the rising number of semiconductors per car.  We have a chart in here that looks at semiconductor values per car and the overall automotive electronics cost per car.  So with a lot of the goods supply chain issues, eventually we expect capital spending to help resolve some of those shortages in addition to increased vaccination rates in Asia and a gradual reduction in some of the shipping costs.
The challenge here is that while we think that the goods supply chains are going to get better, there are still two problems that we think are going to get solved much more slowly, and the first one of those is obviously labor.  US labor shortages appear to be a real chronic issue, driving up wage inflation, very tight labor markets.  Last October, we walked through the seven to eight million people that are missing from the labor force for different reasons, whether it’s accelerated retirement, changes in immigration rules, increased self-employment out of large cities, vaccinated people afraid to return to work, working parents can’t find childcare, unvaccinated people that are fired or furloughed from their jobs.  The bottom line is the latest data from the BLS shows low-skill wages rising at almost 7% a year.  And what we end up with is the tightest labor markets in well over 30 to 40 years.
Now we still don’t know what’s going to happen to the reconciliation bill, given the objections from Manchin, but we could have as much as $2 trillion deployed as direct government purchases and other indirect government purchases.  At a time of very tight labor markets, I’m not sure exactly where all the workers are going to come from and what impact that will have on wages at a time of very tight labor markets.  So while the goods supply chain issues should resolve themselves over the next two months, the labor ones I don’t think will.
And then again, as I mentioned earlier, energy-related inflation may be pretty sticky.  And there has been a massive collapse in oil and gas production investment at a time that global demand for fossil fuels has barely declined.  And for everybody that would like to see more rapid de-carbonization, you have to match the decline in the supply and demand of something, or else the price is simply going to go up and you’re going to end up with more imports.
An extreme version of this is found in Europe.  Electricity prices are soaring to kind of preposterous levels because their renewable energy policy changed faster than underlying fossil fuel demand and given its reliance on Russia for half of all of its thermal energy needs.  If you think US electricity prices are high, just look at the chart here on page ten, which looks at the day-ahead electricity prices in France, Spain, and Germany.  They’re somewhere between six to eight times higher than what they are in the United States per kilowatt hour.
So I’ve summarized a lot of the Executive Summary here, and there’s a lot of other topics we discussed.  But the bottom line is that the Fed is now facing the largest challenge yet to its description of inflation dynamics being transitory.  We agree with the Fed that goods price inflation should roll over in the next few months, but I think, we think that wages and commodity prices are going to remain high because those supply/demand curves have shifted.
So what does all of that mean?  The important question we think you have to ask is what’s the Fed’s end game?  In prior cycles, the end game was a policy rate above the rate of inflation and meaningfully above the rate of inflation.  We think the Fed’s end game in this cycle is going to be a policy rate which more or less reaches inflation.  In other words, in real terms, rates would still be zero.  And part of that has to do with a new approach the Fed has been using to think about what’s the right level of equilibrium policy rates.
So for investors, that means that 2022 might not be as disruptive as you might think in a year of Fed tightening, because the end game here is still very, very favorable for risk-taking because you’re talking about real rates of around zero rather than a real rate of something between 1 and 1.5, or maybe even 2%.  And while the Fed is expected to scale back its asset purchases, the J.P. Morgan economists think there’s going to be another $1 trillion in developed markets central bank balance sheet expansion in 2022, so you’re still going to have support from other central banks.
Boiling it all down, we expect 2022 to be a miniature version in the equity markets of 2021, meaning last year we had massive earnings growth of 33%, a fairly large PE multiple decline of 8 to 10%, and then that offset to deliver a pretty nice return.  We expect something like 10 to 12% or maybe 13% earnings growth this year.  We expect PE multiples to contract again, as they did last year, the net result being something like a 7 to 10% return on the S&P, including dividends.
And part of the headwind there is that in 2021, profit margins were extremely high, mostly because companies passed along cost increases to consumers.  We think we’re getting close to the limits of that, and we may actually see margins fall by 1% or so back to where they were in 2017 to 2019.
So it looks to us like a year of, let’s say, 7 to 10% returns.  But it’s important to recognize that some of the market internals are a lot less favorable than they were last spring, and we expect there to be some fairly big bumps in the road during the year, and that you should retain some liquidity in anticipation of those.  So let me just tick through some of them.  There’s a lot of young unprofitable companies out there.  They make up the largest share of market caps since 1999.  There’s a lot of supply coming from these young unprofitable companies, whether it’s through primary or secondary issuance or insider lockups expiring, that can weigh on the market.
There’s a lot of companies that are now more sensitive to changes in liquidity conditions than economic conditions.  That can weigh on the market.  There’s a lot of concentration of S&P market cap in total return that’s very reliant to a handful of stocks.  And the last point I’d make here is that there are some obvious signs that the momentum plays and the crowded trades are beginning to weaken.  Just look here on page 13 at the chart on Fintech, renewable energy, IPOs in general, SPACs in particular.  You’re starting to see a lot of those momentum liquidity-crowded trades perform very weakly.  So this is a sign to us, all of these things I’ve just mentioned, that we’re going to have a lot more volatility in 2022 than we did in 2021, and people need to be prepared for that.
One last comment on equities.  A lot of our clients are always looking for deep value.  Now you should all be aware looking for deep value ten years into a monetary policy regime of zero interest rates is not likely to deliver very much to you, right?  In other words, everything has been picked over like a Thanksgiving carcass at 1:00 in the morning.  But if you are looking for deep value, there’s not very much the.  The three places you’ll find it, and we talk about this in more detail on the page 14, is large cap pharma, biotech, and airlines.  Each one of those three has their own very specific challenges that explain why they’re trading at deep value levels.  Of the three, large cap pharma looks the most interesting to us.
In the special topic sections, there are three main categories, public equities, real assets, and policy issues.  Within public equities, we talk about the landscape for dividend investors.  Kind of sparse, but there are some things to take a look at.  We talk about cybersecurity, where the need for additional cybersecurity investment just continues to skyrocket.
There are some interesting charts here in terms of thinking about the impact of COVID on the cybersecurity industry.  When you look at the impact of COVID specifically, there has been a big jump in the share of overall customer interactions, products, and services that are now digital compared to in-person when compared to pre-COVID.  And so obviously that creates even more importance for cybersecurity measures and companies and the products and services that they provide.
We have an interesting discussion here on Fintech.  And look, we’re big Fintech fans.  In our wealth management business, we designed investment products to focus on both public and private Fintech companies.  And they’re valued higher than traditional banks despite the fact that at an industry level, the profitability is similar on it when you’re looking at return on equity.
There were three tomatoes that one can throw at the Fintech industry during COVID that we walk through here that I think are important to watch.  The Fintech lenders completely disappeared during the early stages of the pandemic.  They had an unbelievably high estimated incidence of fraud during all the PPP loans.  And there is some evidence that Fintech lending resulted in some much more poorly underwritten loans with greater risk of default than traditional banks.  And this evidence during the COVID period builds upon prior research showing greater systemic risks from Fintech lending in general.  So we’re watching, we’re still enthusiastic about the sector, but we’re watching to see what impact some of these things might have on the regulatory oversight of the Fintech companies.
Within the real assets section, we take a look at commercial office.  I’m surprised to see it already.  There’s a huge bid offer between employees and management with respect to what the future of work looks like.  But what I’m surprised to see here is that there are signs in the US that the office market fundamentals are already improving in terms of absorption of vacant and sublet space.  So we kind of talk through that.  I guess the good news about this whole issue is that office markets in general are much less important than they used to be for most institutional and high net worth investors as office shrinks as a component of an overall diversified commercial real estate portfolio.
We’ve got a long section here on infrastructure investing.  And what I wanted to do is get into some of the details of how these projects actually work, how they generate cash flow, how they protect themselves from disruptive change and things like that.  So I won’t go into the details here, but we did a deep dive on one of our electricity distribution projects, on a contracted solar power project, and another one in bulk liquid storage.  And I think what you’ll see here that’s interesting as a common denominator is the degree to which these projects rely on taker pay contracts which reduce sensitivity to economic growth and other structural changes.
And then there’s a timber section in here which I spent a bit of time on.  Timber investing is a fairly mature industry, and the harvesting yields themselves are fairly predictable.  And we walk through the history of timber investing and how it works and things like that, and fire risks and insect risks and investing outside the US, et cetera, and potential demand from cross-laminated timber.
We conclude though with an interesting discussion on optionality from timber.  There’s a lot of companies that have made commitments regarding their emissions and appear to be relying on accomplishing that through direct air capture, carbon mineralization and all sorts of other things like that, which exist primarily today on cocktail napkins.  I think they’re in for a rude awakening because a lot of these things require massive amounts of energy and cost to perform, and I think a lot of them are going to end up eventually figuring out that buying trees to monetize the unharvested carbon sequestration is the better way to go.
The last section looks at some policy issues, and China needs more time than I can give on a quick 15 to 20-minute podcast.  The bottom line is that we think the positives are going to outweigh the negatives as it relates to the onshore Chinese stocks next year.  There are still plenty of negatives.  The antitrust regulators are still on the march.  There are a lot of restrictions in terms of overseas listings and higher compliance costs.  China is not really providing too much help to defaulting property developers.  Zero COVID policies constrain growth.  The Olympics are coming up, which means you may have anti-pollution policies which still bite.
But the bottom line is we think that you’re starting to see pro-growth statements and allowances for greater credit allocation and things like that, which should make 2022 a better year. J.P. Morgan Equity Research, for example, expects around 20% earnings growth, almost 5% real GDP growth, and just 2% inflation.  And if that happens, investors should benefit.
So that’s it for this podcast.  Thank you for those of you that have been listeners to it.  I look forward to maybe seeing you in the New Year as we maybe start moving around a little bit more.  Of course, with respect to COVID and the Omicron variant and what we know about the duration of efficacy and all sorts of other things, please see our virus web portal.  The Omicron section is section five and goes into details on all the trends and things that we now know.  And the short answer is yes, it is much more transmissible and communicable than all the other variants, but there are early signs that the risk of hospitalization is significantly lower than other variants.  Although once you are hospitalized, the risks appear to be somewhat the same as Delta.  Anyway, enough for now.  Thank you for listening, and let’s hope 2022 is in some ways an easier year for all of us than 2021.  That’s it, bye for now.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.The global supply chain mess will require increased global vaccination and acquired immunity, semiconductor capacity expansion and the end of extraordinary housing/labor supports to resolve. We expect all three to occur over the next few months, leading to a global growth bounce in 2022.
The containership industry is a good illustration of the supply chain mess: as shown in the first chart, more than 70 containerships are stacked up outside Los Angeles/Long Beach ports waiting to unload. Idle containerships are back to just 3% of the total fleet, shipping costs are surging, manufacturing delivery times are extended and rail shipments are declining sharply from their summer peak, illustrating the far reaching impact of the delays.Why so many bottlenecks? Supply chain disruptions due to shipping cost discrepancies
COVID has disrupted supply chains in two major ways: surging demand for imported consumer goods in the West due to pandemic work from home trends and other home improvement spending, and a decline in workers required to maintain and operate these supply chains. The surge in US import demand has led to a sharp rise in eastbound freight rates (see charts for Shanghai->LA and Shanghai->Rotterdam).
However, westbound freight rates have not risen nearly as much, leading to an odd and problematic phenomenon: incentives for container owners to move them back to China
empty
to accelerate receipt of eastbound freight rates, instead of waiting for containers to be refilled to earn westbound freight rates as well
. This is illustrated in the fourth chart which shows departing containers from LA/LB: a lot of them started leaving empty once eastbound freight rates surged. This further exacerbates supply chain issues, since US goods (i.e., grains) that were supposed to depart US railcars and warehouses for export remain in place, occupying space that US imported goods were destined for.The other big bottleneck: the semiconductor shortage
Semiconductors are the world’s 4
th
most traded good after crude oil, refined oil and cars. Strong demand existed before COVID and reflected the chip-intensity of 5G, AI, electric vehicles (3-5x the chip content of ICE cars) and the internet of things. Current chip shortages are mostly related to older and simpler 200-mm silicon wafers used in cars, computers, monitors, laptops, TVs, refrigerators and washing machines.
Demand for many of these items soared during the pandemic as people built out home offices and related projects
; this surge in demand is illustrated below via the rise in Taiwanese electronic component exports. One by-product of the shortage:
a rise in US auto manufacturer inventories and a collapse in dealer inventories as manufacturers wait for the chips they need
. Auto consulting firm Alix now estimates that the semiconductor shortage will cost US auto manufacturers $210 bn this year, up from their $60 bn estimate back in January. Ford is actually offering customers faster delivery if they agree to “lower feature content”, which translates into fewer semiconductors.
There’s limited economic incentive to build new 200-mm chip plants given wafer-thin margins; only a handful of new ones are planned for 2022. Even so, there’s a few billion dollars being invested to expand capacity by ~20% in existing plants, in which case the semiconductor squeeze may start to ease by Q2 2022. Auto manufacturers are also discussing longer term contracts with Tier 2 suppliers that might incent them to build out new 200-mm capacity. As shown below, adding capacity to existing factories will take a few months at least, in which case the semiconductor shortage will drag on into next year.Note that global supply chain problems are not getting better as growth momentum slows, since production growth is declining as fast as new order growth. For all the clients that have asked me about the political and economic problems associated with the rise of autonomous vehicles and more unemployed truckers,
I keep telling them they’ve got it backwards: the US has had a trucker
shortage
for the last few years, and it’s projected to get worse
. In other words, COVID has worsened some existing vulnerabilities in the US supply chain, just as global trade is surging. As for the August US inflation report in which CPI came in lower than expectations, that was mostly a function of COVID related declines in airfare, lodging and rental cars. These categories will probably bounce back when the Delta wave fades, and the other categories are still rising sharply.Bottleneck resolution
First, the world is going to need more containers, which carry more than 90% of the world’s traded goods. Chinese companies affiliated with its government make 95% of the world’s containers and have ramped up production. The number of containerships in service is rising as well, albeit more slowly; again, China stands to benefit as the world’s largest shipbuilder (37% of the shipbuilding market in 2019 by deadweight, and 45% of all new shipbuilding orders). Another example of how China continues to reap unforeseen economic gains from COVID; another is the rise in global export market share that China has gained vs its Asian export competitors.But more containers and containerships won’t solve problems in the West unless other supply chain issues are resolved as well.
That will probably require (a) an end to extraordinary housing and income support measures, and (b) less community spread and concern about COVID. So far, most analyses show
very little job growth differentials between US states that terminated subsidies vs those that didn’t
1
. That said, some forecasts call for 1.3 million new jobs by year-end due to expiring unemployment benefits and another 300,000 new jobs due to school reopening. Around 2/3 of continuing claimants receive some pandemic unemployment assistance, which is another sign that such benefits are impacting the labor force participation rate.The federal
foreclosure moratorium
officially ended on July 31
.
However, we don’t anticipate a sharp rise in new foreclosure filings due to a CFPB rule issued in June that established procedural safeguards that have to be met before foreclosures can begin (hurdles are hard to meet and include provisions that a property has to be abandoned, or that the servicer hasn’t heard from the borrower for an extended period). The new rule expires in December 2021, after which normal foreclosure patterns might resume. Foreclosures fell close to zero in the US once the moratorium was put in place. The second chart shows the gap between the MBA definition of delinquency which defines deferred payments as delinquent, and the Fed definition which does not. See Appendix for a discussion of homeowner vs renter treatment.
One more thing on housing:
read about the issues with LoanDepot
. So, one of many undercapitalized fintech lenders (most of whom have limited special servicing capabilities) allegedly processed thousands of loans without required documents such as employment and income verifications? Color me unsurprised
2
.Housing and income policy may have to normalize before labor supplies do.
As shown below, G7 manufacturing wages are rising at a very high rate given the prevailing level of unemployment, another sign of labor markets whose supply-demand equilibrium has shifted. By the way, I find it interesting that
some people arguing for continued extension of COVID benefits also argue for the largest amount of new Congressional spending ($3.5 trillion),
without explaining what that might do to current labor shortages, where all these new workers are supposed to come from and how all that spending might impact inflation and Fed policy. In August, 50% of small business owners said they had job openings they already couldn’t fill, the highest level on record.As for COVID, concerns may dissipate in the next few months
. As we explained on our August webcast, this fall was going to be a very bad one in the US. Even so, given the high degree of Delta variant contagiousness, a combination of vaccination and acquired immunity should drive drive down pandemic measures substantially by November. The latest infection and hospitalization data from Hotspot states, horrific as they are (i.e., the world’s highest reported mortality rate) are beginning to roll over; mortality should follow. For anyone that disbelieves COVID mortality data, see the sixth chart below: there has been another surge in mortality from all causes in the US relative to seasonal trends. If you can think of another reason for this other than COVID, please let me know. The biggest risk to this outlook is fading immunity of vaccinated people; we will know over the next couple of months how this plays out in the US. Booster shots in Israel appear to drive antibody levels up substantially, and also result in Pfizer efficacy vs severe infection that rises above 90% again.Developing world infections and mortality are declining
due to exhaustion of Lambda and Gamma variants in Latin America and the decline in the Delta variant in Asia (although mortality is rising in Eastern Europe again).  Many Asian countries have higher COVID stringency rules than developed countries, an indication of how seriously govt’s view the risks and the ability of their healthcare systems to respond to it.  Emerging markets are not the epicenter of most supply chain problems, at least as measured by supplier delivery times.
But countries like Malaysia play an outsized role in the semiconductor food chain due to its role as a major center for chip testing and packaging
, the last step in the semiconductor food chain which is also more labor-intensive than automated wafer fabrication.  The delta variant has caused Infineon, NXP and STMicroelectronics shutdowns in Asia, which resulted in component shortages at Nissan, Toyota, Ford and GM operations elsewhere.  Malaysia is also a large producer of multilayer ceramic capacitors, used in smartphones and cars.
Some good news on Asia
.  As noted above, infections and mortality are finally rolling over.  Vaccination rates have hit 70% in Malaysia; while they are still less than 50% in Indonesia, Thailand, Philippines and Vietnam, acquired immunity appears to be playing a role now as well.  Furthermore, mRNA vaccines should make greater inroads in the entire region in 2022, displacing Chinese vaccines with lower observed efficacy
3
.Finally, capital flows are returning in anticipation of less severe bottleneck issues ahead.Appendix: Homeowners vs Renters and US housing policy
As discussed in the ""Bottleneck Resolution"" section, the federal
foreclosure
moratorium has expired and there are safeguards in place which should keep the number of foreclosures low until early next year when a CFPB rule expires. The federal
eviction
moratoria are separate policies; some have already expired, while GSE and FHA versions will expire at the end of September. Eviction rules cover renters and homeowners, while foreclosure rules only apply to homeowners. Several Democratic Senators have introduced legislation to reinstate federal eviction moratoria after the Supreme Court ruled that the CDC overstepped its authority in mandating it.
States can apply their own foreclosure and eviction moratoria alongside the federal government; banks are required to follow both. There are currently live foreclosure moratoria in NY, Oregon and DC.
While federal eviction moratoria prohibited evictions of renters and homeowners, the treatment for missed payments is different. For example, delinquent renters at the end of the moratorium are treated differently than homeowners who missed payments while in a CARES Act forbearance. Homeowners with federally backed mortgages (or with mortgages from banks applying this approach to all borrowers at their discretion) are allowed to defer missed payments and are not considered to be delinquent. In these cases, homeowners that don’t pay will not face immediate payment of accrued balances, which in most cases will be added as a balloon at the end of their mortgages. Banks generally record unpaid interest as current on an accrual basis. Finally, there are programs in place to modify mortgages for borrowers unable to resume their prior payments due to financial distress.
Renters, however, are not explicitly allowed to defer; the eviction moratorium simply prohibits landlords from evicting them for non-payment. Renters could face immediate payment of accrued amounts, with any negotiated terms up to the landlord. In addition, non-payment could affect a renter’s credit score, while the same is usually not the case with homeowners under the circumstances outlined above.
The Federal Emergency Rental Assistance program made $47 billion in funding available for tenants and landlords to be distributed by states and local governments. This funding was aimed at helping tenants cover rent, back rent and utilities as well as helping landlords cover mortgage payments. However, only $5 billion of this program was distributed as of July 2021.
The National Equity Atlas estimated that as of mid-August 2021, 15% of renters (5.9 million renter households) were behind on rent payments. This compares to ~7% of renters unable to pay rent in 2017.
Landlords who hold federally backed mortgages were eligible for the federal mortgage and foreclosure relief programs, which were extended through June 30, 2021.
In addition, some states established their own rental relief programs. For example, New York’s landlord loan program provides loans to small landlords with a loss of rental income, and California’s rental assistance program helps both tenants and landlords cover rent and mortgage payments at the expiration of the eviction and foreclosure moratorium.1

According to a paper released by the Philadelphia Federal Reserve,
70% of the massive rise in fintech loans is simply due to regulatory arbitrage
rather than fintech lenders having superior technology or lower costs. Also: shadow banks now control the riskiest segment of the market (FHA). You get what you pay for. See “

Forecasts call for 1.3 million new jobs by year end due to expiring unemployment benefits and another 300k due to school reopening.Stacked bar chart shows the ratio of continuing claims to job openings since the beginning of 2021. The chart breaks down all claims into two categories: claims under pandemic assistance programs and all other. The chart shows that 2/3 of those showing up in continuing claims are receiving some form of pandemic unemployment assistance.Line chart shows home foreclosures since 2003. The chart illustrates the impact of the foreclosure moratorium; once the moratorium was put in place foreclosures essentially fell to zero.Line chart shows prior day COVID hospital admissions in US COVID hotspot states by 18-39 and 40-59 age groups. Prior day admissions for the 40-59 age group have risen to about 1,600, which is much higher than the previous peak of about 900 in January. Prior day admissions for the 18-39 age group have risen to about 800, which is also much higher than the small increase to almost 400 in January.Line chart which plots manufacturing wages versus the unemployment rate in the G7. The chart shows that manufacturing wages are rising at a very high level (~3% since last year) given the prevailing level of unemployment.Line chart which should the percent of small businesses with hard to fill job openings. In August, 50% of small business owners said they had job openings they already couldn’t fill, the highest level on recordLine chart shows daily infections per million and daily deaths per million for the developed world. The rise in infections and mortality are much higher than was anticipated when the vaccination programs began. Daily infections are above 200 per mm and daily deaths are above 2 per mm.Line chart shows daily infections per million, current hospitalizations and daily deaths per million for US COVID hotspot states.  Daily infections and hospitalizations have begun to roll over from the latest surge, while mortality is still rising.Line chart shows countries and US states with the 25 highest mortality rates. US hotspot mortality rates are now the highest in the world, alongside Malaysia, and are more than 10x higher than mortality rates in the rest of the developed world. Of US states, Alabama now has the highest mortality rate, edging out Florida.Line chart shows daily infections per million, current hospitalizations and daily deaths per million for Israel. The COVID surge in Israel has been higher than anticipated given Israel’s ~70% vaccination rate. Daily infections are just below 800 per mm and daily deaths are close to 2 per mm.Line chart shows countries and US states with the 25 highest mortality rates. US hotspot mortality rates are now the highest in the world, alongside Malaysia, and are more than 10x higher than mortality rates in the rest of the developed world. Of US states, Alabama now has the highest mortality rate, edging out Florida.Line chart shows actual deaths per week from all causes vs the threshold for excess deaths from 2017 to 2021. Actual deaths from all causes were below the threshold from 2017 to the start of COVID, with the exception of a brief spike in 2018. Actual deaths from all causes spiked at the end of 2020 at about 90,000 before dropping to the threshold. Recently, however, actual deaths have started to pick up again and are well above seasonal trends (about 70,000 actual deaths per week).Line chart shows daily COVID-19 deaths per million people for emerging market countries (Latin America, Eastern Europe, EM Asia and the Middle East). In the developing world, infections and mortality are declining.  This is the result of exhaustion of Lambda and Gamma variants in Latin America and the decline in the Delta variant in Asia (note that mortality is rising in Eastern Europe again).Bar chart which shows vaccination rates by country. The chart illustrates the higher level of vaccination for developed countries relative to emerging market countries. Canada, France and South Korea have vaccination rates around 80%, whereas Vietnam, Indonesia and Philippines vaccination rates are closer to 30%.Bar chart shows the Oxford lockdown stringency index levels for various countries. Many Emerging Market countries (in red) have higher COVID stringency requirements than developed countries, an indication of how seriously the governments themselves view the risks of the pandemic and the ability of their healthcare systems to respond to it.Line chart shows capital inflows to emerging market countries since September 2013. In 2021, flows have been returning to the region in anticipation of less severe bottleneck issues next year.Line chart shows index levels for US, UK and Eurozone manufacturing delivery times. All three locations show a steep increase in delivery times from September 2020 to now, starting at levels around 40-45 and dropping to 15-25, where smaller values indicate longer lead times.Line chart shows index levels for Vietnam, India, China, South Korea and Brazil manufacturing delivery times. After recovering from small increases in lead times at the start of COVID, delivery times have not changed significantly for India, China and South Korea. Brazil demonstrated a larger increase in delivery times (around 10 at its worst), but has recovered to about 42. Vietnam is currently seeing a spike in delivery times to around 30, after having been between 40 and 50 for most of the period since January 2020.FEMALE VOICE:  This podcast has been prepared exclusively for institutional, wholesale, professional clients and qualified investors only as defined by local laws and regulations.  Please read other important information which can be found on the link at the end of the podcast episode
MR. MICHAEL CEMBALEST:  Good morning everybody.  This is the late September Eye on the Market podcast.  I’m recording this from a CEO event in Ennis, Montana.  It’s very beautiful here, but it’s not highly vaccinated.  All the CEOs are telling me more or less the same thing.  They intend to hire more people.  It’s very difficult to find people.  The COVID situation is making the challenges even greater.  And they’re all experiencing pretty substantial delays in the supplier delivery lays with respect to manufactured goods.  And this week’s Eye on the Market gets into this whole supply chain mess.  And one of the fascinating things about this is the attribution of these problems to the shipping cost discrepancies between eastbound and westbound freight.
So let me get into that a little bit, and this is on page two of the piece.  There was a surge in goods consumption in the United States when COVID hit, as everybody started building out home offices and doing home improvement projects, and overall just increasing their goods spending and drastically cutting back on their services spending.  So all of a sudden, global trade volume started to pick up just at the time that COVID was beginning to negatively impact all the workers and the supply chains in the U.S. and Asia.
And then the shipping thing started to kick in a few months ago, and this is kind of remarkable in an odd and unfortunately very concerning way economically.  There has been a giant surge in freight rates for container ships between Shanghai, from Shanghai to Los Angeles that hasn’t been matched by an increase of freight rates from Los Angeles back to Shanghai.  So what has that done, is create this weird economic incentive for container ship owners to move them back to China empty to accelerate the receipt of the eastbound freight rates, instead of waiting for U.S. goods to be loaded up so they can earn the westbound freight rates as well.  And so based on the latest data we’re seeing, the westbound freight rates from Los Angeles to Shanghai are below $2,000 or 40-ft. box.  The eastbound ones are above 12,000.  So I can see why that’s happening.
And we actually have a chart in here showing this giant increase in the container ships that are being, returning to Asia empty are now dwarfing the ones that are actually loaded.  This is messing up the supply chain in a lot of understandable ways, because as U.S. goods that were destined for export don’t leave the ports, they sit there and railcars and manufacturing sites and warehouses and dock areas are occupying the space that all of those containers ships waiting to unload into the U.S., they don’t have the space to do that.  So that’s one big aspect of the supply chain disruptions that have to do with these enormous shipping cost discrepancies.
And the other one, of course, is the semiconductor issue.  We talked about this a little bit last time, but just to go over a little bit of again, these chip shortages are related to the older and simpler 200-mm wafers, but they’re used in everything, cars, computers, laptops, refrigerators, washing machines.  These are the things that soared in terms of demand during the pandemic as people built out home offices, and the impact on auto manufacturers is kind of remarkable.  We have a chart in here that looks at the surge in manufacturer inventories and the collapse in dealer inventories as they’re waiting for the chips to come in to complete those vehicles and get them out for sale.
There’s limited economic incentive for people to build these new plants because the margins are so low, and there’s only a handful of new ones planned for 2022.  The good news is that there’s a few billion dollars being invested to expand capacity in the existing plants, in which case the semiconductor squeeze should start to ease a little bit by Q2 of next year.  And auto manufacturers are also discussing some long-term contracts with these tier two semiconductor suppliers that might incent them to build out some new capacity kind of the way an LNG export facility works.  It’s very hard to finance a multibillion dollar LNG export facility unless you’ve got pre-committed investment grade long-term contracts to help finance construction.  And increasingly, we might see that required to get new semiconductor capacity built.
And for all the clients that have always mentioned to me over the years their concerns about the political and economic problems associated with the rise of autonomous vehicles and lots of unemployed and angry truckers, I always tell them they’ve got it backwards.  The U.S. has had a trucker shortage for the last few years, and it’s projected to get much worse.  And so what’s happened here is that COVID has worsened some of the vulnerabilities in the U.S. supply chain, just as global goods trading is surging and people want more stuff instead of services.
So how does this get resolved?  This is one of the topics we spent a lot of time here on at this CEO gathering.  Well, the world is going to need more containers which carry more than 90% of the world’s traded goods, right.  So the world needs more of these containers.  Who comes to the rescue here?  Unsurprisingly, the Chinese get the benefit.  The Chinese companies affiliated with the Chinese government make up, I think 95% of the world’s container production market, and they’ve ramped up production. We’re also going to need more container ships in service.  Those are rising obviously more slowly.  They take time to build.  Who is going to benefit there?  China, the world’s largest ship builder.  I think they got 45% of all new shipbuilding orders in 2019.  Here are some more examples of how China continues to reap some unforeseen benefits from this COVID pandemic.
But more containers and container ships aren’t going to solve the problems in the West unless some of the other supply chain issues are resolved as well that have to do with labor, and that’s probably going to require an end to extraordinary housing and income support measures and a lot less concern about COVID.  So far, most of the analyses that we’ve seen don’t show a big differential in job growth between states that terminated the employment subsidies and those that didn’t.  That may have to do with the fact that it hasn’t happened yet but it’s going to; it may have to do with the fact that the Delta variant is a bigger issue.  We don’t know yet.
That said, most of the forecasts we see call for around one-and-a-half to two million new jobs by the end of the year, due to some combination of expiring unemployment benefits and school reopening and less concerns about COVID.  So we’ll see.  And then on the foreclosure moratorium, those programs are also scheduled to end this fall.  Foreclosures collapsed once the moratorium was put in place, and so that’s also ending.
And so the bottom line is that U.S. and European housing and income policies may have to normalize before labor supplies do.  When you look, we have a chart in here that looks at G7 manufacturing wages rising at some incredibly rapid clip at a time when unemployment rates are still this high.  And then one last comment here.  It is interesting that some of the people that are arguing for endless extension of the COVID unemployment benefits are also arguing for the largest amount of new Congressional spending, like 3.5 trillion.
Without circling how all of that Congressional spending, what it might do to labor shortages, where are all these new workers supposed to come from, and how might that impact inflation and Fed policy?  In August, around half of all small business owners said they had job openings that they already couldn’t fill, which is the highest level on record, and that’s before people are suggesting $3.5 trillion worth of new Congressional spending.
So on the COVID side, the concerns may dissipate in the next few months.  We had a client webcast in August where we laid out our vision for the fall that was heavily influenced by research we’ve done, conversations that we had with epidemiologists and chief medical officers at the vaccine companies.  And what we laid out was okay, this is going to be a terrible fall in the U.S.  And so far it is.  The latest infection and hospitalization mortality data in the hot spot states, mostly in the Southeast, are terrible.  The U.S. has the highest reported mortality rate in the world in the southeastern United States.
But we also thought that, given the high degree of Delta-contagiousness, a combination of vaccination and acquired immunity would drive down these pandemic measures substantially by, let’s call it November.  It looks like we’re still on track there.  We’ve got a chart in here showing a pretty sharp rollover in infections and hospitalizations in the Southeast.  Mortality is still rising, and it is a terrible rate and all the things you read about the ICU are true, but given the lag times between infection, hospitalization, and mortality, you would expect the death situation to get a lot better in the next few weeks as well.
The biggest look to this outlook is the fading immunity of vaccinated people.  We just don’t have enough information on this yet.  We’ll know more over the next few months how this plays out.  It is clear that the booster shots in Israel are driving antibody levels up substantially.  And for all the people concerned about Pfizer’s very modest efficacy gap versus Modena, the booster shots in Israel are showing that the efficacy numbers for Pfizer go back well above 90%, which is where the Moderna numbers are.  So if you’re concerned about that gap, go get a booster shot.
The developing world situation is a little more nuanced.  First of all, infections and mortality are declining.  This is mostly the result of the exhaustion of the lambda and gamma variants in Latin America and the delta variant in Asia.  A lot of these countries have very high COVID stringency requirements, more so than, even more so than countries in the U.S. and Europe.  That said, they don’t appear to be the epicenter of supply chain problems, because when we look at the data on manufacturing delivery time delays, the data is much worse for the Euro zone and the U.S. than it is for India, China, South Korea, and Brazil.  We know that in places like Malaysia that there are some issues around semiconductors and other stuff, but most of the supply chain issues appeared to be developed market problems, and that’s why some combination of reduced COVID concern and income and policy, income and housing support policy normalization are going to be required to resolve this.
So when does that happen?  I think both of those things happen over the next few months, and we start to see an easing of supply chains in Q1 of next year, although I will say that based on the CEOs in attendance at this event, they were more thinking Q3 and Q4 of next year.  So we’ll see how that plays out, and we’ll update you in the future as to whether they were right or I was right.  Anyway, thanks for listening, and we’ll talk to you next time, bye.

https://privatebank.jpmorgan.com/gl/en/insights/investing/eotm/manchin-and-the-reconciliation-bill,"Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.
Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.You have all seen the news articles by now. The short version: Pelosi encouraged House Democrats to pass a bill that Manchin said all along he would not agree to. One article referred to Pelosi “frog-marching House Democrats to the pot”. Perhaps the White House thought that they would be able to change Manchin’s mind; in any case, it didn’t work. Manchin made an offer to the White House recently with his own $1.8 trillion bill, which the White House rejected. Instead, the White House attacked Manchin publicly yesterday with language usually reserved for people in the opposing party, which they might have deemed appropriate since Manchin made his final reservations known while being interviewed on Fox News. The fallout:
It is still possible that the reconciliation bill gets resurrected.
Progressives in the House and Senate may have to choose between Manchin’s version of the bill or walking away with nothing
. Manchin’s version of the bill has not been disclosed but would still presumably include pre-K, a few hundred billion for climate change, Medicaid expansion, housing subsidies, higher education benefits and workforce training, and changes to Medicare drug price caps and price setting. The big exclusions: paid leave, Medicare expansion, fully refundable child tax credits with no work requirement and some other items.
Even for the items that Manchin would include, he appears to want them scored from a budget perspective as if they are permanent rather than temporary. He reportedly considers temporary spending programs that phase out as budget gimmicks given the likelihood that such programs may be made permanent at some point, in which case they would have a larger impact on the budget deficit. Specifically: as passed by the House, the cost of the child tax credit, pre-K, health insurance subsidies and home & community based care would be $770 bn.  But if made permanent, their costs would rise to $3.0 trillion
Manchin also mentioned the need for changes in the way that climate spending is allocated, the importance of grid reliability, and mentioned California and Texas as examples of where the renewable transition is happening too fast for local energy markets to adapt to. He might also have been thinking about the situation in Europe right now (see first chart). Falling investment in thermal energy, unreliable supplies of Russian natural gas, a cold winter in Russia and Europe, lower than expected wind speeds, emergency repairs of French nuclear plants and rising CO
2
permit prices have resulted in sky-rocketing electricity prices across Europe
Manchin also mentioned inflation concerns; headline CPI may rise further in the next few months before falling again, making passage of a large bill more difficult
In case no bill is resurrected, Goldman Sachs economists announced today that they would cut their US GDP growth forecasts by around 0.5% for 2022 given the front-loaded nature of the reconciliation bill spending
If no bill is passed, renewable energy stocks could be negatively affected, and it could be a moderate positive for biotech and pharma since the reconciliation bill included provisions to cap drug prices and allow Medicare to begin negotiating drug prices in 2025 for 10 older drugs with no generic competition; by 2030 this would rise to 100 drugs. While the corporate tax provisions in the bill would not be implemented, the TJCA would still be in force and would require companies in 2022 to start amortizing R&D and software development costs over 5 years, expenses which are now fully deductible in year 1. Congress may somehow prevent this from happening, but it could take time in a no-bill scenario. One more thing on taxes: if the reconciliation bill is not passed or is seriously altered, it is not clear how other countries would react regarding negotiations to establish a global minimum tax regime and their agreement to temporarily suspend digital service taxes on US tech firms, and the decision by the US to temporarily suspend imposition of tariffs in response.
The reconciliation (build back better) bill relied heavily on upfront spending offset by net tax increases and spending cuts in later years to be deemed deficit-neutral. The fourth chart shows the reconciliation bill relative to the size of the infrastructure bill.
Some government relations people on Wall Street believe that Manchin is not operating alone and has implicit support from other members. I’m not so sure. While Sinema has made her objections to corporate tax increases known, that’s about it. Senators Hassan, Kelly and Masto also reportedly have some reservations about the House version of the bill, but as far as I can tell have not said much publicly indicating that they would not vote for it as it is written. The bigger picture politically: if Democrats had won 52-54 seats in 2020 as they were projected to, Manchin’s objections could be ignored. And if Republicans had been able to hold onto one or both Senate seats in the Georgia runoff as they were expected to, there would be no reconciliation bill to begin with.
Manchin is one of the last remaining conservative Southern Democratic Senators. The Southern Democratic Leadership Council was formed in 1985 in the wake of Mondale’s loss, and rose to prominence during the Clinton era. As shown in the second chart, non-conformists in the Senate in both parties collapsed by the year 2000, and the Southern Democratic Leadership Council was disbanded in 2011 as the party became more progressive. The third chart shows where Manchin and Sinema exist within a spatial polarization chart of the 116
th
Congress based on congressional voting histories.
Have a good holiday and get your booster shot. The last chart shows the substantial increase in vaccine efficacy from a booster shot against both Delta and Omicron variants. Boosters increase the concentration of neutralizing antibodies and also appear to create antibodies targeting more parts of the virus than the first two shots. Even if the booster shot does not prevent respiratory infection from Omicron, there are preliminary signs that it may prevent more serious pulmonary and neurological damage which puts people in the hospital. See our web portal Section 5 for more on the Omicron variant.Line chart shows US vs Europe day ahead electricity prices since 2015. Chart shows that electricity prices for France, Spain and Germany spiked from levels below $100 per MWh to $388, $348 and $320 respectively at the end of 2021. US electricity prices have remained fairly steady at around $50 per MWh at its most recent point.Line chart shows the number of party non-conformists in the Senate (senators who vote against their own party) since 1958. Chart shows that total non-conformists as well as republican and democrat non-conformists have steadily declined since 1958.Dot plot chart showing 2019-2020 senate polarization scores for the 116th congress, with higher positive scores indicating senators are more liberal and lower negative scores indicating senators are more conservative. The chart highlights Manchin as having a score slightly above 0, indicating the senator is the most moderate of the liberal senators.Bar chart shows the deficit impact of the Build Back Better and infrastructure bills shown in billions of dollars. Chart shows that in 2022 through 2016 both the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework and the Build Back Better plan would increase the deficit. From 2027 through 2030 the Build Back Better plan decreases the deficit but the bipartisan infrastructure framework would increase the deficit. In 2031, both bills would decrease the deficit by around $150 billion.Bar chart shows Pfizer vaccine efficacy against symptomatic infection against Delta and Omicron for fully vaccinated people and those after receiving a booster shot. Chart shows that people fully vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine have 60% efficacy against symptomatic infection caused by Delta, compare to 95% efficacy for those receiving the booster. Against the omicron variant, fully vaccinated efficacy is around 35% compared to 75% for those after receiving the booster.Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.On equity markets, the Lombards, SPAC investors, Bone-setters, George Washington, COVID bots and Omicron
We started out 2021 optimistic on equities given our outlook on economic growth, earnings growth, limited new equity supply, low interest rates and the arrival of mRNA vaccines. We underestimated just how
much
the reopening would boost earnings, which exceeded our expectations across the developed world. Earnings growth accounts for all of the developed world equity market gains in 2021 as P/E multiples fell markedly. By the way, that US-EM equity barbell vs Europe-Japan worked
again
this year; resistance to the barbell is futile. The selloff in China shows few signs of relenting as more Chinese companies prepare to delist, and as China has now expanded the regulatory powers and reach of antitrust regulators.As always, developed world governments and central banks are doing their part to support this, prolonging the largest fiscal and monetary experiment since the Lombards created banking in the Middle Ages.
I get asked a lot how Western gov’t debt burdens are going to be resolved in the long run. I have some theories but intend to retire long before I see if they’re correct or not. Hard to say for sure, the rise in cryptocurrency values from $250 billion before COVID to $2.5 trillion today has a lot to do in my view with the chart below on the left showing the destruction of the post-war compact between governments and savers.For a year of high returns on US stock markets, there was still plenty of pain to go around
. As shown in the chart, a fairly large share of stocks fell at least 35% from their highs in 2021. The last time this kind of thing happened (rising markets and a large share of stocks losing 35% or more): 1998 and 1999. These repriced stocks are a broader warning regarding ultra-high valuations, and the risk of holding stocks that rely excessively on liquidity, momentum and crowded trades.
For a complete list of US stocks with market capitalization of over $10 billion that declined by 35% or more this year from peak levels, see the PDF version of this note. There are a lot of “household” names in there, including Viacom (-69%), Altice (-64%), Teladoc (-64%), Zoom (-56%), Anaplan (-48%), Global Payments (-45%), Scotts (-45%), Citrix (-44%) and Paypal (-39%).Along the way in 2021, we made some pit stops in this piece

More on the Middle Ages
. I’m writing the 2022 Outlook from a basement apartment where I have been for the last 6 weeks, recovering from an accident which resulted in the x-ray below of my reconstructed leg. I was engaging in activity typically associated with younger people. The outcome was not unusual; middle-aged people have similar lifestyles and injury patterns to younger people but have higher/longer hospital charges,
injury complications and ICU stays that are more similar to the elderly
2
.
While this has been a regrettable incident, I’m fortunate to have access to 21st century medicine. In the Middle
Ages, surgical techniques were different. Bone-setters would use devices to realign fractured limbs, which were then covered with bandages dipped in egg whites, milk or mulled wine, and then inserted into large wooden splints made of tree branches. Subsequent growth deformities would sometimes occur and in case of infection, limbs might have to be amputated. Pain medication: ice (when available), alcohol (usually gin) and laudanum (opium). Ether was not widely used until the 1800’s.Sources: Hospital for Special Surgery (x-ray); “
Armamentarium Chirurgiae
”, Ioannis Sculteti, 1693; and “
A General System of Surgery in Three Parts, Containing the Doctrine and Management of Wounds, Fractures, Luxations, Tumors, and Ulcers of All Kinds
”, Lorenz Heister (University of Altdorf), 1768Medical knowledge improved during the 18
th
century
. George Washington mandated that all Continental Army troops be inoculated against smallpox in 1777 and 1778 using a crude process called variolation, without which the outcome of the war might have been different. Smallpox effectively disappeared in Boston once a vaccine was developed in 1800. It wasn’t until the 1940’s that life expectancy began to rise more rapidly, largely due to mass production of antibiotics discovered a decade earlier.Fast forward to 2021 and the COVID pandemic.
Dr. Atul Nakhasi, physician and policy advisor to the Los Angeles Health Department, wrote a post on LinkedIn in October. He talked about caring for unvaccinated COVID patients in their 20’s and 30’s who were on ventilators, and how they regretted not getting the vaccine. I used to think LinkedIn was less prone to this, but Dr Nakhasi’s post attracted a flurry of critical responses.
The barrage included
comments about creeping socialism, how CDC treatment protocols are killing people, how drug companies prefer more sick people since they make more money that way, how doctors are being “held at gunpoint” and arrested if they say anything negative about the vaccine, that vaccines are more dangerous than the disease itself, that vaccines don’t work, that they cause fertility problems, that more people die of the flu than from COVID, that most deaths are vaccinated people and that deaths are being miscategorized since doctors have a financial incentive to inflate COVID deaths since they make more money that way.
Maybe some of these responses were from bot accounts designed to sow dissension in the West
; according to a 2021 report from the EU External Action Service, that’s exactly what state-sponsored operatives have been doing via social media

.
Furthermore, a May 2021 piece in the Journal of Medical Internet Research found that two thirds of all bots were discussing COVID in some way

I understand those who started out skeptical in the Greek sense of the word (“skepsis” = investigation), since COVID is the first disease for which mRNA vaccines are being widely used. But for the record…
[A] Overall death rates in the US have been much higher than normal, and COVID is the only rational explanation for that. You can ignore people who ramble on about miscategorized death certificates.
[B] Estimates for COVID’s infection fatality rate (the chances of dying if you get it) vary but no matter which one you use, they’re all much higher than the infection fatality rate for the flu. The range: 18x-84x higher.[C] How many unvaccinated people are actually dying of COVID vs those dying from the flu? We can estimate this for the 20 states reporting such data. In these states, unvaccinated COVID deaths per day have been ~18x higher than the number of unvaccinated flu deaths per day, and the year isn’t over yet. The details: just for the period from April 4 to October 2, around 7 people per mm unvaccinated against COVID died every day in these states, compared to 0.4 daily deaths per mm people that were unvaccinated for the flu. For the flu, we are using the three years before COVID as a baseline.
[D] While there are signs of fading mRNA efficacy vs infection, efficacy remains high vs hospitalization, ICU admission and death, particularly with a booster. You’re taking much greater chances by being unvaccinated, and that’s before incorporating risks of long COVID conditions. The chart below is through October and does not include the November COVID wave.
New risks for the unvaccinated
: based on data from South Africa,
Omicron
looks to be much more contagious than the Delta variant, and has resulted in greater reinfection rates among unvaccinated COVID survivors. There are preliminary signs of less disease severity, particularly among vaccinated people but the data is still very recent.
See our COVID web portal
for more on the Omicron variant.[E] mRNA vaccines prevent negative COVID outcomes far more often than they cause myocarditis.
See COVID portal Section 1
for information on the massive number of infections, hospitalizations, ICU admissions and deaths prevented by mRNA vaccines compared to cases of myocarditis that they cause.
If you are going to ignore all of this, you might as well transport yourself back to the Middle Ages and take your chances there with a cocktail of leeches, hydroxychloroquine and zinc. To all of our clients, vaccinated or not, I wish you all a safe and happy holiday season.

MR. MICHAEL CEMBALEST:  Hello, everybody, and welcome to the Holiday 2021 Eye on the Market.  This one's called the ""Middle Ages,"" for reasons you'll see in a minute.  Well, that was an interesting year.  We started out optimistic on equities, given our outlook on economic growth and leverage in corporate profits, limited new equity supply, lower interest rates and the idea that the COVID would have its impact reduced somewhat by vaccination.
We underestimated just how much operating leverage there was that companies would experience earnings growth shattered our expectations across the developed world, whether it was Japan, or Europe, or the United States, and equity markets rose handsomely in a lot of places despite declining PE multiples.
And by the way, for those of you keeping score at home, that barbell of U.S. and emerging markets overweight versus Europe and Japan worked again this year, despite the problems with China.  Resistance is futile on that front.
As always, the legislatures and central banks were doing their part to support all this.  We are now seeing, again, the largest monetary and fiscal experiment since the Lombards created banking in the Middle Ages.  I get asked a lot how these debt burdens are going to be resolved in the long run.  I have some ideas, but I will be retired long before I see if they're right or not.
It's hard to say for sure, but when you look at the expansion of Central Bank balance sheets--and there's no way I can convey this on a podcast.  You actually have to look in the piece at the chart.  When you see the rise in government debt and central bank balance sheets, it's kind of not surprising that cryptocurrency values rose from $250 billion before COVID to $2.5 trillion today.
In any case, in the piece this week we make brief mention of some of the topics that we discussed and the Eye on the Market this year is kind of a year-end review.  We started out the year in January, walking through the specifics of the 12th Amendment and the Electoral Count Act because of the joint session of Congress.
We've talked about stock markets, concentrated stocks.  We had our deep-dive energy paper.  We look at private equity and venture capital returns, goods and labor supply change delays and how long they take to revolve, unfunded retire health can [phonetic] and pension issues of U.S. states, and then we spent a lot of time on the commodity price shock and the imbalance between supply-and-demand policies.
There's a great chart in this Eye on the Market that you've got to see.  It shows the collapse in capital spending by S&P 1200 energy companies, which is a global basket.  Since 2015, capital spending by those companies is down 75%, so that's fine.  That reduces the supply.  What about demand for fossil fuels?  They're basically unchanged since 2015.
So there are some important questions to ask here.  We either need to stop the capital spending decline by these energy companies or we radically need to accelerate the decline in both the emerging and develop world and fossil fuel use.  And it's not clear on the policy front that that gap is going to be closed.
I apologize for the sirens.  I live in Brooklyn and it kind of goes with the territory.  Okay, so the sirens are gone.
I'm working on the Eye on the Market outlook for 2022.  It comes out on January 1st.  In addition to all the market stuff we're going to talk about what to do if you're a yield-oriented investor and looking for dividends.  We're going to take a look at China.  Is China's investment prospects--I don't think this regulatory purge is over.
U.S. office market fundamentals are already improving, despite very low office utilization rates.  We'll look at that.  We're going to look at potential upside for timber investors in a world searching for real sequestration.  Briefly, we'll talk about Brexit, which we haven't talked about in a while.
And we take a look at infrastructure investing, which I think is really interesting, and things like regulated electricity distribution, solar power generation and liquid bulk storage.  We take a look also at cybersecurity investing.  One of the things that's most interesting about COVID's long-term impact is the substantial increase in products and services around the world that are now being offered digitally compared to pre-COVID.
That, of course, increases all sorts of cybercrime and opportunity for investors in cyber-security.  And then, finally, some underwhelming news on what the fintech industry did during COVID.  You will be both disgusted and amazed.
Anyway, so I'm writing this outlook from a basement apartment.  As many of you know, I had an accident and--let's see--I had a tibia plateau fracture and torn meniscus.  I was engaging in activity that's typically associated with younger people. And in the Eye in the Market this week, I get into the specifics of how happy I am to have access to 21st century medicine.
In the Middle Ages they would have bonesetters that would use these devices with cranks to realign your fractured limbs, and then they would dip the bandages in egg whites or milk and put them in a splint made of tree branches.  And obviously, sometimes you would have growth deformities from this, and in case of infection they might have to amputate your limb.  So I am happy to have access to 21st century medicine.
Medical knowledge improved during the 18th century, and this is a particularly interesting case given what's going on in the world right now.  Everybody's hero, George Washington, mandated that the Continental Army be inoculated against smallpox in 1777.  They didn't have vaccines yet, but they had this crude process called variolation.  And if he hadn't done that, the Continental Army might well have lost the war.
Smallpox disappeared in Boston around 1800, when there was a vaccine development.  And when you look at the history of life expectancy since the 1700s, it wasn't really until the 1940s when life expectancies in the developed world began to rise more rapidly, mostly due to mass production of antibiotics that were first discovered in the 1930s.
And I talk about the Middle Ages and some of this stuff with George Washington and bonesetters, 'cause let's fast-forward now to 2021 and the COVID pandemic.  There was this guy; his name is Dr. Atul Nakhasi.  He's a physician and policy advisor to the L.A. Health Department.  And he wrote a LinkedIn post in October and he talked about caring for unvaccinated COVID patients in their 20s and 30s who are on ventilators and how they regretted not getting the vaccine.
I used to think LinkedIn was less like Twitter, but apparently it's not, when you look at the posts that people made in response to Dr. Nakhasi using these examples.  People accused him of being creeping socialist.  They talked about how CDC protocols are the things that are actually killing people in the first place; how drug companies prefer when more people sick, 'cause they make more money; how doctors are held at gunpoint and arrested if they say anything negative about vaccines; that vaccines are more dangerous than the disease itself; that the vaccines don't work; they cause fertility problems; less dangerous than the flu, etc. etc.
And that was kind of interesting to read.  My first thought is that some of these responses were from bot accounts designed to sow dissention in the West.  There was a study from the EU External Action Service that demonstrated that that's exactly what operatives have been doing on social media, which is to discredit the efficacy of Western vaccines.
And there was a piece in the ""Journal of Medical Internet Research,"" that founds that two-thirds of all bots were discussing COVID in some way.  But a lot of these responses appeared to be real ones.
I understand people that started out skeptical about the mRNA vaccines.  COVID's the first disease for which the mRNA vaccine approach is being widely used.  From the very beginning, I was hoping to take Novavax.  I was hoping that the subunit protein vaccines, otherwise known as recombinant protein vaccines, would be approved early on, and those are the kinds of vaccines that all of us have taken our whole lives.
But it's taken, as usually does, it has taken the recombinant protein vaccines a much longer period of time to be approved, as they usually do.
Anyway, for the record, five things.  Number one, overall death rates in the United States have been much higher than normal.  COVID is the only rational explanation for that.  So if anybody tells you that, you know, there's miscategorized death certificates, just ignore them.  Number two, estimates for COVID's infection fatality rate--in other words, what's the chance of dying if you get it--are kind of all over the place.  But no matter which one you use, and we plotted 12 of them that we found, they're all much higher than the infection fatality rate for the flu and the range is anywhere from 20 to 80 times higher.
Now, how many people are actually dying of COVID versus dying from the flu, which is a function of the infection fatality rate and the frequency of the disease in getting it.  There's actually 20 states in the U.S. that report that data.  And in these states the unvaccinated COVID deaths have been about 8 times higher than the number of unvaccinated flu deaths, and the year isn't even over yet.
So that data is just for the period of April through October, and we're using for the flu the three years before COVID as a baseline.  So no, you know, anybody saying that COVID is less dangerous than the flu just simply doesn't feel like looking at information.
Number four, the mRNA vaccines are not 100% effective.  They were never advertised to be, but while there are signs of fading efficacy versus infection.  The evidence from the U.S. and other countries shows very high efficacy of mRNA vaccines versus hospitalization, ICU admission and death.  Particularly if you get booster shot, you are taking much better chances by being unvaccinated, and that's even before incorporating the risk of long-COVID conditions.
We have some charts in here.  I don't know how to make this any simpler than it already is.  The charts have one line for unvaccinated and another one for fully vaccinated, in terms of infection and mortality and you can look [phonetic] for yourself.
Of course, like everybody else, we're looking at and examining the data out of South Africa regarding Omicron cases and hospitalizations.  It's really soon in the process.  There is uncertainty around the timing of some of those original infections, so estimates of transmissibility are still very fuzzy.
Hospitalizations are rising, but there's a gap between the private and public hospitals in South Africa.  We need to have a couple of weeks of patients here before you start interpreting some of this stuff.  And also, within a couple of weeks Pfizer and Moderna should have completed their in vitro tests regarding the efficacy, at least in vitro, of their vaccines against this variant.
And then number five, the mRNA vaccines prevent negative COVID outcomes far more often than they cause myocarditis, and we have some data in here as well on that.
Anyway, if you're going to ignore all this information, you might as well just transport yourself back to the Middle Ages and take your chances there with a cocktail of leeches and hydroxychloroquine and zinc.
Anyway, to all of our clients, whether vaccinated or not, I wish you all a very safe and Happy Holiday season and you will hear from us next around the timing of the 2022 Eye on the Market outlook, which comes out on January 1st.  Have a great Holiday Season.

MR. MICHAEL CEMBALEST:
Hello, everybody. This is Michael Cembalest with the Eye on the Market podcast for February 2002. For those of you that have been reading the Eye on the Market for a while, you’ll recognize that there’s one topic that I haven’t said a single word about, which is cryptocurrencies and the blockchain. And I’ve been debating whether or not I wanted to dive into this, but I just decided that there was too much going on to continue sidestepping it, even though banks like ours have a lot of restrictions in terms of what kinds of things that we can even execute with customers on this topic. But I thought it was important to take a look, and so I have published a piece called The Maltese Falcoin, which goes into a lot of the crypto and blockchain issues at hand.
So this is not going to be a long podcast. I’m not going to dive into the details here. We look at venture capital flows into the crypto and blockchain space, adoption trends by institutional and high net worth investors of cryptocurrency, and then we get into three or actually five specific use cases, sorry, Bitcoin in the store of value, crypto use in cross-border remittances, crypto used in decentralized finance, non-fungible tokens in the art world, and then a discussion about financial services’ adoption of the blockchain itself in permission to private blockchains.
My take on this is obviously less optimistic than a lot of the people that inhabit the crypto and blockchain world fulltime, as you can tell from the title of the piece. So I circulated it to a number of them for rebuttals, and I include a section here called Rebuttals to this paper, where you can see some of the visions that are a lot bolder than mine in terms of what the future holds with respect to cryptocurrency and blockchain applications. And then I’ve got some conclusions in a really nice picture of Humphrey Bogart. So that’s really all I feel like sharing today. Take a look at the piece, and I hope you enjoy it, and I’ll talk to you next time.

Kathryn Pasqualone:
Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us.  My name is Kathryn Pasqualone, and I'm a client advisor here at J.P. Morgan Asset Management within our North American Institutional Business.  Today I'm joined by Michael Cembalest, Chairman of Market and Investment Strategy for JP Morgan Asset and Wealth Management, and Monica DiCenso, head of the Global Investment Opportunities Group within the J.P. Morgan Private Bank.  As we know, last week Russia launched a full-scale invasion of the Ukraine.  There's a lot to unpack here from a macroeconomic perspective, but first we would like to send our thoughts and prayers to the victims of this terrible tragedy and all of those suffering.  For investors it poses a number of questions which we're going to try to tackle today.  As many of you know, Michael released an Eye on the Market on this very topic.  For the next 45 minutes or so, Michael and Monica are going to discuss their views on the evolving situation and the implications for investors. So with that, Michael and Monica, over to you.
Michael Cembalest:
All right, thanks.  It might be an hour rather than 45 minutes, but we'll try to wrap it up quickly.  Thank you, everybody, for dialing in.  A lot of people my age have parents that fled wars in Europe, so this all brings back some memories that are not great.  And so I wanted to start just with a few minutes of history.  I hope everybody listened to the disclaimer in the beginning that said these are the views of Michael Cembalest and nobody else at the firm, because you're about to hear some.
What is it that the Ukrainians are trying to flee here?  Russia might be the most consistently authoritarian place on the planet over the last millennium.  They were ruled by the Mongols from 1250 to around 1500, and then for the next 400 years or so, they were representative of the most you authoritarian rule in Europe.  There was a brief lull for 20 or 40 years.  And then you had 75 years of Soviet totalitarianism, which was arguably the most deep-rooted system of totalitarianism that the world had ever seen at that point.
So I just want to put context around what Russia has been for the last millennium and maybe some of the misreading of what has taken place in history.
What is Russia today?  Let's go to the first slide just so that nobody is under any illusions.  This is a chart that we put together a couple of years ago.  And it looks at the rights of the individual versus the rights of the state, and it looks at things like due process, press freedom, religious freedom, corruption, military involvement in politics.  Where is Russia on this chart?  Right where you would expect them to be it he lower right in between Iran and China.  So that is -- that's Russia.  And there might have been a misreading of just how intent the Russians were on regaining control over the Ukraine.  I just want to walk through some history here before we get started on some of the market stuff.
If you can go to the next page, in the late 1990s, there was a NATO enlargement.  And just to put some context on it, it was the purple region on this map.  And the sum of that land area is more than the land area of France and Italy and Germany combined.  So that was a massive movement eastward.  And it was not a unilaterally well-received one, even in the West.  And if you can just skip ahead to -- go ahead to the next page.  There's some history here that we can skip.  The only thing I do want to point out is as recently as 2008 and again in 2013, NATO leaders were pushing NATO membership for Georgia and the Ukraine.  But I do want to go to the next page, because it's part of the history that we have to try to understand, and we can't avoid.  There were a lot of foreign policy experts, politicians and military officers in the late 1990s, including some of the most well-respected people that I've ever either known, met or read about in my life who wrote letters in opposition to this NATO expansion.  And George Kennan, who was the architect of the postwar peace with the Soviets, said that the Russians would react quite adversely to this.  And he thought it was a tragic mistake.  It's odd to bring this up at a time that the Ukrainians are fighting bravely for their lives, but it is part of the history here, because if NATO was really going to dangle membership in front of the Ukraine, we can now arguably say, within this debate about liberalism versus realism in foreign policy, that maybe that should not have been done without sufficient guarantees to protect them in the accession process of joining.
Go to the next page.
Just so everybody understands, you know, I ran emerging markets for J.P. Morgan in the 1990s.  We all kind of thought Boris Yeltsin was a bit of a joke.  He was drunk in public and Russia was flat on its back.  Look at these charts.  Russia had no foreign exchange reserves after default, the current account had collapsed, the Ruble had collapsed.  But apart from making smart important policy decisions is not just estimating your enemy in the present but understanding what they might be in the future.  This is a very different Russia we're dealing with right now.  It's very well-funded.  And a lot of the sanctions may do some damage here, but Russia is a very different place than it was in the 1990s when NATO pushed the expansion right to Russia's doorstep.  And so I'm speaking for myself and probably a lot of the people on the call here, I'm praying for the Ukraine.  But it looks pretty dire when you look at the military balance between the two countries.  They've had some success with some Turkish drones and some Stinger missiles and more help coming from Western Europe.  But I think at this point I don't know why the base case wouldn't be that Russia forges ahead, despite sustaining massive casualties of their own, and eventually takes control politically of the Ukraine, I don't know how one could avoid that central scenario.  As I mentioned, I'm praying that the outcome is something that's different than that.
Let's go -- now let's get into some of the issues here around the politics and around the markets and around energy.  Let's go to the next page. You've all read about this.  The sanctions checklist has been growing.  We don't need to go into details here.  I think there's lots of unknowns about how effective the limits on Russia central bank trading will be.  There are debates about how effective the SWIFT network blockage is going to be.  Notice in the first bullet point fight all the sanctions on the Russian banks, there are carve-outs for transactions related to energy and agricultural exports for all the obvious reasons.  And, you know, it was interesting to see the Nord Stream pipeline project frozen for the time being.  But I think that this is more likely to be a lasting legacy of the conflict than something that changes the nature of the conflict or its outcome.
Let's take a look at some other things that have been happening.  And this was just a partial list on the next page.  Some of these are kind of remarkable.  Next page. Germany for the first time is supplying anti-aircraft and other weapons to another country.  The same thing for Norway.  The last time Norway supplied arms to another country it was 1939 when the Soviets invaded Finland.  There are contributions from the Dutch and from the Belgians.  Germany is closing airspace to Russian aircraft.  BP the other day, then Shell, either just outright writing off or selling their stakes in Russian energy companies.  I do think that there should be some questions about Daimler which has a relationship with the Russian vehicle company that produces vehicles for the Russian military.  The Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund is dumping Russian assets.  Even the Swiss are considering greater sanctions participation, which is a sign of how much this has galvanized opposition.  But, again, all of these things are simply raising the price that the Russians are apparently already willing to pay. Let's go to the next slide.
Monica DiCenso:
I want to jump in there, Michael, real quick.  We're going through this list.  Is there anything that they can do, because it does feel like it's a lot of little things happening.  Do you think there's something bigger that could happen that could change  the outcome, the scary outcome, that you outlined earlier?
Michael Cembalest:
It's not clear to me even an embargo on Russian energy exports would end up depriving the Russian government of the ability to conduct this war to the conclusion that they planned for.  If you look at the amount of foreign exchange reserves that they have already amassed and if you look at a population that takes its life into its hands for protesting its government, and you look at the fact that China made plenty of loans to Russia in 2014, after the annexation of Crimea, we have no reason to believe they wouldn't do the same this time around.  China would also look advantageously in all likelihood at the opportunity to buy discounted energy exports from China-- from Russia.  It's not clear -- and again, and the ability of the Russian government to incur massive losses without having to worry too much about domestic reaction, it's not clear that any -- it's not clear to me that any constellation of things, other than NATO participation in defending the Ukraine, would be able to change the outcome that appears to be underway.  But that’s-
Monica DiCenso:
The reserve balance is part of the scary chart, showing how deep their pockets are.  I mean, at this pace, how long can they last like this?  You're saying years potentially?
Michael Cembalest:
These kind of conflicts tend not to last for years.  You know, they could end up in a Vietnamese type quagmire, or an Afghanistan-type quagmire; anything is possible.  But that would simply raise the cost.  And again, it does appear that at least the Russian leadership, at the highest level, is willing to pay a significantly high cost here. Look, there's lots of commentary out here that Putin massively underestimated the amount of sanctions and their breadth and their depth and the brave resistance on the part of the Ukrainians and the underperformance, apparently, on parts of the Russian military, but I don't know that that necessarily changes the outcome.
Let's go to this issue you mentioned on what can and can't be done, because it starts with energy, right?  What have we been saying?  For the last 12 years in our annual energy paper?  Energy transitions are slow things, not fast things.  We have these charts where we compare rapid adoption of smartphones and social media and all sorts of other stuff that get adapted immediately.  We're sitting here, wind and solar power still represent, after 15 years of investment, something like 2 to 3% of global primary energy use, and roughly the same percentage of the global fleet is electric vehicles.  Energy transitions take a lot of time.   Let's jump ahead to the next slide so we can start to get into that.
This is a tough chart.  You know, Europe basically has been advocating its own domestic production of oil and gas, in favor of renewables, and is now equally reliant on Russia as it is reliant on its own domestic production for oil and gas, with Germany, Italy and the Netherlands being the most exposed.  There are just no magic bullets for substituting for Russian oil and gas.  And I'll have a couple of charts that explain why.  But this is a shocking chart.  If the United States had this chart, I think there would be an enormous amount of political recrimination if the United States ever allowed itself to get into this kind of a vise where we had this degree of energy dependence on another country.  Let's go to the next one.
And -- and just to break it down, of all the imports, Europe gets around 60% of them from Russia for natural gas, and around 30% for oil.  So it's really, as you might have read, it's a gas issue for now.  Next.  Next page, please.
Now, this is the cost the Europeans have paid so far, and we don't even have any explicit controls, tariffs or war-related sanctions on importation of Russian energy.  The chart on the left is wholesale electricity prices.  And the chart on the right is wholesale natural gas prices.  These are remarkable changes in energy prices, the likes of which I've never seen before, in a developed country, in this magnitude in this short period of time. Now, there are –
Monica DiCenso:
Anything Europe can do to extricate itself from this?  It's a little scary, at least in the near term.
Michael Cembalest:
Over a 10 to 15 year time frame, sure.  Over a 10 to 15 month time frame, absolutely not.  And some of the most ill-informed things I’ve ever read about energy are the things that talk about the ability to engage in rapid this transitions, and  I don't know if this is going to happen, but somebody mentioned to me today that the Biden administration, in the State of the Union address, might actually announce the creation of a strategic gas reserve alongside the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.  Imagine the about face of the Biden administration acknowledging the critical nature of natural gas.  That would be remarkable. Next page.
Monica DiCenso:
How much does the strategic oil reserve, or potentially, gas reserve, can even play in, because  people always say, “Oh, we'll open up more reserves.”  But does that really matter?
Michael Cembalest:
Well, no—well, what they’re talking about—  well, releasing the strategic petroleum reserve is a way, over the short term, of controlling the increase in gasoline prices.  The acknowledgment that you need a strategic natural gas reserve is because for home heating and industrial production, you're highly reliant on natural gas.  Now, there's some, in some corners, I've read LNG to the rescue, U.S. LNG exports.  Not quite so simple.  LNG exports, you can’t ship gas.  You have to ship compressed gas, which means that you need very expensive liquefaction and regasification facilities on both sides of that trans-Atlantic trade.  And shipping costs are expensive.
Now, let's look at the chart on the left.  So the chart on the left shows that pipeline flows from Russia have been going down over the last few months.  That's the blue line.  The gold line is LNG imports into Europe are rising.  The red dots are the U.S.  So the U.S. is participating in the provision of more natural gas to Europe through LNG, which is helping, and allowing them to slightly reduce their exposure.  But at what cost?  LNG import prices in Europe have nothing to do with Henry Hub prices in the U.S.  The chart on the right, the blue line is Henry Hub prices for natural gas in the U.S., that gold line is European natural gas prices, and the red line is European LNG imports.  So in other words, our LNG and the LNG from Qatar and Algeria and Australia is imported at the marginal price for gas, which is where the European natural gas prices are.  So the U.S. can help in terms of flows, but in cost terms, it doesn’t really solve anything for the Europeans.  Next.
And just to spend one more minute on this, the chart on the left shows why.  I mean, when you look at where gas comes into Europe, Russia is an enormous chunk of that.  Then the other brown slices are all the LNG regasification facilities that exist in Europe.  But they take years to build.  Each one is going to be either 1 to 1.5 billion dollars at least, and you can't just say let's shut down a third or a quarter or a half of that Russian buy and immediately rely on LNG, because the existing LNG facilities are operating at above 90% utilization rate as it is.  So as a long-term plan to secure more supplies, it's potentially an answer, but it's very expensive, the cost is high, and you know that's still the big issue.  Next.
And I -- I'm not going it dwell on this, but for everybody that says, well, isn't there something the Europeans could do about their energy reliance on Russia?  Okay, here's the chart.  This is European energy consumption.  Most of it is for industrial production of glass, cement, bricks, ammonia, fertilizer, steel and things like that.  And as you can see, they use a lot of oil and they use a lot of gas.  It's very difficult to electrify industrial production, another topic that we've written about a lot in the energy paper each year.  Then you can see a massive transport bar that's mostly oil.  Europe is making more progress than the U.S. on electric vehicle penetration.  But remember, EV as a percentage of sales can go up fast, but EV as percentage of the stock takes much longer to rise.  And then you can see the other two bars, residential and commercial home heating uses lots of natural gas and oil as well. Those dotted things, that's the electricity grid.  And Europe is making a lot of progress in decarbonizing the grid, which are those green segments with the white dots.  But the lesson here is probably the single most important thing about energy that I'm always telling our clients, which is decarbonizing the grid is very different than decarbonizing overall energy use, when the grid only represents 20% of energy consumption.  Right?  So when you say what can the Europeans do?  Well, whatever it is they do will require them to decarbonize home heating, transportation and industrial production, and that takes a really long time.
Monica DiCenso:
Add it all up, you don't see a way for them to pivot in the near term to pull away from this dependence?
Michael Cembalest:
Again, if they want to pivot away using natural gas, that would be reliance on LNG exporters at a much higher price, whether it's 3 times 4 times 5 times, I don't know, could be in that range, and if you’re talking about pivoting by increasing the pace of renewable energy, they're doing it on the grid, but there's very little evidence of a rapid transition taking place outside the grid. OK?  Let's keep going.
So what happens next in oil markets?  Well, Russia could divert a million barrels a day or so to China.  The U.S. is talking about releasing some of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.  It looks like the French, Russians and U.K. negotiators are cooperating on one thing, which is reviving the nuclear agreement with Iran which would free up maybe a million barrels a day from an Iranian floating storage and maybe another few hundred thousand barrels a day of additional production by the end of the production year.  But all things considered, I don't though how we get out of $100 to $125 dollar oil over the next three to six months.  It would take a global recession to drive oil prices way below that level.
Monica DiCenso:
Yeah, one—I guess one question on that.  At 125, you don't think it's high enough to push us into a global recession.  Is that maybe 150, 175, something like that?
Michael Cembalest:
There’s are a lot of coefficients that people estimate in terms elasticity, growth and inflation, employment, changing oil prices, things like that.  I do think it's above 125.  I mean, they're very imprecise beasts, but I do think it's above 125.
.
Monica DiCenso:
And then I guess on Putin for one second, in looking at all this, it feels like he has a lot of leverage, so maybe we can answer this later, but what is his end game here, because—keep going on Ukraine, but I guess I'm struggling with what's next and where this ends.
Michael Cembalest:
You know, again, in 2008, NATO made a push for Georgia to join NATO.  The Russians invaded Georgia and that was the end of it.  I think we're seeing the same thing play out, which is the Russians are going to seek to end this conflict, when they have sufficiently destabilized the Ukraine into a state of misery and poverty and political weakness, that they are unable to creditably say that they would be joining NATO.  If I'm trying to find a silver lining here, it would be so far that the performance of the Russian military has been such that I think it would be very difficult for them to contemplate a subsequent invasion of an actual NATO country.  And I can imagine that the U.S. military is paying very close attention to the successes and failures of Russian equipment planning, cyber, and everything else. Next.
So the problem is -- and this is different.  I mean, this is different than where we were just three or four weeks ago; wars like this can exacerbate very tight conditions in energy and grain markets -- we'll get to the rest in a minute, but here's another chart that I've been showing people, the chart on left.  It-- decarbonization is great, but if you push too hard on supply and not on demand, you're going to have a problem.  The chart on demand shows the world has been pushing real hard on decarbonizing the available supplies of energy.  That blue line is the capital spending by the world's largest public energy companies.  Unfortunately, demand hasn't changed at all.  So global primary energy fossil fuel use isn't changing, right?  So in a lot of countries there's been a lot of decoupling on policies supply and balloon that aren't working so great now, and in this kind of environment, you get energy price spikes.  And we also, for a variety of other reasons, headed into this year with declining inventories of wheat and corn.  And so the Ukraine is a pretty substantial producer of both, and so we're going to end up with not just energy price inflation but inflation of agricultural products as well, which can feed into inflation in other intermediate goods.  Let's go to the next page.
From an investor's perspective, as 18 months ago, we were baffled by the perception that fossil fuels were essentially permanently stranded assets.  And we didn't agree with the degree of outperformance of renewables, less traditional energy.  And as you can see, starting about 18 months ago, almost coincident with our energy paper, when we wrote about this, it's moved pretty rapidly in the other direction, and that Mark Twain quote, “for better or for worse, reports of my death are greatly exaggerated” is pretty accurate here as it relating to the relationship between the world and fossil fuels.  And here you can see how quickly the pricing of some of those relative equity baskets changed.  Next.
And here you can see agricultural prices skyrocketing, industrial metals prices skyrocketing.  These are a little misleading because these are prices, and every year energy intensity goes down.  So the amount of industrial metals per unit of growth is not what it was two decades ago.  So this price spike is not as painful.  Same thing with oil.  Same thing with gasoline, right?  So the energy intensity of the world isn't what it was, but still these are pretty big spikes that are going to hurt consumption, and in terms of non-energy-related and none food-related consumption, and hurt confidence as well.  Next.
So, here are some charts from our outlook.  We are expecting these things to be improving.  These are the supply chain charts.  We expected these things to be improving by May or June.  They're improving a little.  So the chart on the left is delivery times in the manufacturing sector.  We still believe over the next few months there is going to loosen up.  There's been a lot of capital spending in semiconductors, in the auto space, and we think some of that is going to pay off.  But these manufacturing delivery times are still big.  And then as you can see on the right, those LA and Long Beach ports, the number of anchored containerships there is still very high.  And I will -- I think it was on the last webcast I showed that of 350 ports in the United States, these rank 320 and 323 in terms of their productivity and efficiency.  So what's going on here is not just a supply chain issue, but some very specific productivity issues, a lot of which relate to the lack of automation in these LA and Long Beach ports, which account for a third of all container ship imports into the United States.
Monica DiCenso:
And how does that get alleviated?  That takes time as well, right?  So there’s no quick fix.
Michael Cembalest:
It does.  I mean, the quickest fix here, other than changing a lot of what we know about the state of California and its politics, the quickest fix here is a shift in consumption from goods to services.  And we had that massive COVID surge of goods-related spending.  As the Omicron wave subsides and in many parts of the United States, it's subsiding as rapidly, as quickly, as it went up, we're starting to see some evidence of spending shift from goods to services.  We need to have that come through real hard and real past over the next two to three months to start alleviating some of these bottlenecks.  We've got to keep moving.  Next.
All right, so rising input costs are challenging.  The good news is rising input costs, whether they're energy or labor, tend not by themselves to cause recessions.  And that's because revenues -- one person's costs are another person's revenues.  And look at this chart.  It's kind of remarkable how revenues and costs tend to move in tandem.  So the bigger question is not are costs going up.  The bigger question is, is there going to be a recession as a result of the war, changes in confidence, changes in spending and changes in inflation.  So let's take a look.
Monica DiCenso:
I keep getting asked again, will this make the Fed pause, then, for example, on their hikes, for example?
Michael Cembalest:
I don't think so.  Let's take a look.  Next page.
Russia and the Ukraine just don't account for that much of U.S. imports and exports to affect the inflationary dynamics that are underway.  And this is really the back drop that may be hurting the markets this year even more than the Russia/Ukraine conflict, is last Labor Day, the markets were pricing in zero Fed hikes.  I've been doing this for a long time, and I don't remember a time when we went from the market pricing zero hikes to pricing seven hikes in, you know, five months.  And so that's a big adjustment for the markets to make.  And I don't know -- maybe at the low end they hike five times, but the -- we're starting to see the beginnings of a little bit of a wage price spiral.  Let's spend more time looking at this inflation question, because it's critical in terms of whether or not the Fed can deliver a soft landing versus a hard landing. So next.
The history is not great.  There have been five episodes where headline inflation went above 5%.  And it took a recession every time to knock it down.  A combination of Fed tightening and recession.  Now, you know, I don't know that the hyperinflationary or stagflationary conditions of the '70s are relevant here.  And so 1990 and 2010 are the most recent examples of this, of when you had headline inflation over 5% and you couldn't really get out of that spiral without a recession.  The Fed has a shot this time at a soft landing.  And let me explain why.  So let's go to the next page.
This is the weirdest chart that I've seen over the last I think -- in a long, long, long time.  Normally there's some relationship between goods inflation and services inflation.  And during the bulk of the 2000s, goods inflation was way more depressed than services because of the United States let China into the World Trade Organization in 2001 and you have this massive flood of emerging market imports that depresses goods inflation.  But look at the this spike.  The goods inflation spike here that's pandemic-related is anomalous.  You use your own adjective.  I don't know how else to describe it other than anomalous.  And it suggests that there's a big payback in the pipeline once some of the supply chain issues, whether it's used cars or anything like that, starts to loosen up.  And so I think the Fed's got a shot here because of how strange this inflationary spike happens to be, and that resolution -- they're still going to have to hike.  But I don't think they're going to have to, for instance, raise the policy rate above the rate of inflation this year, or early next year, in order to get control over this, because there's going to be some pay back from this blue goods inflation line coming down.
Monica DiCenso:
Basically we have a skewing of some of the data because of the effect of the COVID, which is making things look a little funny?
Michael Cembalest:
They look funny to me.  And I think this pandemic related surge will hopefully start to resolve itself.  And we're already, as I mentioned, when we look at the Chase data on spending, we're already starting to see a shift from goods to services.  Let's go to the next page.
Here's why the Fed can't do nothing.  Which is -- by the way, a lot of this data we're looking at was also hanging around last summer and the Fed were still saying they were going to do nothing, because they thought it was all transitory.  Now it's not so transitory.  Inflation is broadening a little bit to services.  You're starting to see wages increase.  The chart on this page is a composite of average hourly earnings and the employment cost index adjusted for -- normalized for certain things.  It's the best chart I've seen in terms of capturing what wages are actually doing.  And then we've also got some really bizarre increases, 8, 10, 12, 15%, in the rental market, because of very tight housing markets.
Monica DiCenso:
Because you're coming off a low number from COVID, you think?
Michael Cembalest:
It's partially that.  It's partially for two years a lot of states and cities had foreclosure and eviction moratorium that distort the markets.  We had massive amounts of fiscal stimulus at the same time.  You had unemployment benefits in some certain places that exceeded people's prior incomes.  A lot of things that happened during COVID that hadn't happened before and distorted some of these things.  But they appeared to have caught fire a little bit from a kindling perspective, and that's why the Fed has to act.  And that's why I think almost irrespective of what happen happens in the Ukraine, you're looking at at least five hikes this year, unless we end up in a shooting warn between NATO and the Russians.  I don't think you can put a zero chance on it, but I think it's certainly  clear that the NATO countries are trying as hard as they can to try to avoid that.  In terms of the West supplying weapons to the Ukraine, let's not forget that the French supplied Exocet missiles to the Falklands to the war with the U.K.  Sometimes people don't react to weapons sales the same way they do to people firing weapons at you.  Next.
Monica DiCenso:
One question on that, because you mentioned a potential for a  shooting war; we hope not.  How popular do you think this war is on the ground in Russia?  And I don't know if we have a great way to gauge it, but like, you just wonder, at some point it becomes very unpopular and is enough pressure?
Michael Cembalest:
You know, I don't know how to answer that question other than saying for the last 20 years, I've been hearing people in the State Department talk about how Iranian sanctions were going to change the vex on the ground in Iran, and they have not.  It doesn't mean they weren't worth doing.  But there’s been some interesting research, and I read about this once on Eye on the Market,  on how the long history of sanctions against determined monarchist or authoritarian regimes doesn't work auctions the outlet for people to complain is they end up in jail or worse.  So as we saw from the very first chart in this presentation, Russia doesn't really take kindly to people protesting, and so I don't know that it matters, is my short answer.
Now, the silver lining for the Fed is this -- inflation expectations have gone up in the short term, but they haven't anchored yet over the longer term.  So the chart on the left shows how, in 1980, and then again in 1990, consumers were expecting over one year and five years inflation to be elevated.  This time around there's a gap.  Same thing, chart on the right, median expected inflation rates, much higher one year versus three year.  So, the Fed has got a window here if they get some relief on the goods inflation, they'll have a chance here to get a soft landing, if longer term inflation expectations don't really solidify at much higher levels than they are now.  So they've got a window, and I would like to see the Biden Administration focused a lot -- as much as they can on helping the Ukraine, but also as much as they possibly can on taking steps to resolve supply chain and labor market issues.  We lost 1.5 to 2 million people out of the labor force who retired during COVID; more than trend, right?  That's 1.5 to 2 million more than the trend.  Very hard to get those people back into the labor force once they leave.  There are still several million people that can't get childcare because of COVID, people who aren't working because they refuse to get vaccinated.  So whatever the Biden Administration can do to resolve supply chain and labor bottlenecks is going to be really important for the Fed.  And I can't say I've really seen a lot of credible policymaking on that front. Next.
And some of the models that we follow agree with the prior page, which is that both producer prices and consumer prices will probably be drifting down over the next few months.  The producer prices on the left, you can see, are already starting to roll over.  And we think that using models based on global business conditions, the CPI is going to follow. So as things stand right now, we still think that the Fed has got a shot here to hike five or six times, funds rate still negative, 10-year still negative in real terms.  And they don't have to crush multiples.  But if the Fed has to bring the policy rate above the rate of inflation, you know, you get another large contraction in equity multiples.
Monica DiCenso:
And so your five times assumption is based on GPC prices coming down.  So fast-forward three months, we're not seeing that?
Michael Cembalest:
Five or six hikes this year.  Yeah. Next.
Let's talk about the equity markets.  It's a weird mix.  There are certain parts of the equity markets that have really gotten shellacked, which are beginning to look interesting, and others only modestly adjusted.  So here, the cyclicals have given up a lot of ground versus defensives.  But, boy, it was a long ten-year climb up that mountain.  So I wouldn't say that cyclicals are necessarily trading at depressed .deep value type levels here.  And so this particular one hasn't moved that much.  Next page.
Let's take a look at value versus growth.  Similar story.  Value has been recovering.  There's two different ways to look at it here.  But value has been recovering versus the broad market versus growth.  But there's still a pretty long way to go here.  Which means that the average growth stock hasn't really gotten -- you haven't really seen capitulation in the average tech, software, services, and parts of the healthcare sector to protect growth stock.  Next page.  Let's look at parts of the market that have been clobbered.
Some of the weakest links have been crumbling.  Here you can look at the SPACs, IPOs, thin tech, renewable, clean tech.  And I'm not surprised -- and for those of you who remember the piece we wrote a year ago now -- did you do the SPAC call with me?
Monica DiCenso:
You know, we did the meme stock call together.  I was just thinking--
Michael Cembalest:
The meme--  I forget who I did the SPAC call with; my memory is gone.  But I'm not surprised that the SPAC market ended up being the thing that pulled the plug on the broader pricing for crazy risk.  I call it SPAC-cine hesitancy.  That's how much we disliked this market and its adverse selection.  And I think for this market cycle the SPAC prize goes to Nikola, which is the fuel cell truck that staged its demonstration with a truck that didn't have a fuel cell in it, it had a hidden extension cord and they pushed it down the hill.  For me, that tells you a lot about what you need to know about companies going public via SPAC mergers. But anyway, a lot of these weak links have gotten clobbered.  Next page.
The low margin stocks have finally come back to earth.  The last couple of charts are giving me a little bit more comfort about averaging into risk over the next few months and weeks, because a lot of the stuff that was massively mispriced have adjusted. And—
Monica DiCenso:
--because you see these huge corrections in some sectors, right?  Overall S&P is down 9 to 10% to date.  We started the year called S&P to be up high single digits.  Do you still stand by that view?  Like, that implies pretty meaningful upside for people.
Michael Cembalest:
Yeah, and l do think that based on a certain constellation of events, where the West accepts the horrible facts on the ground in the Ukraine, we don't get explicit bans on Russian commodity courts, the Fed hikes five to six times, goods price inflation starts to roll over by mid-year, I could definitely see -- and I'll get to the reasons why in a minute, but I still think we can reach those levels.  Let's look at another one.  Look at this one.
This is a distribution of the draw downs, you know, which is a decline from peak levels, on the Nasdaq stocks.  So the average Nasdaq stock is down 40 or 45% from its peak, and a huge chunk of them are down 50, 60, 70% from peak levels.  So you know, you've got to be -- by the way, this is an argument that ETFs in down markets can do damage.  It will be interesting to see how the active management community does here.  But this is telling me that there is a lot of capitulation in parts of the market, and I think this is an important thing it look at.  Next.
And, you know, this is another one of our capitulation charts.  One of the weirdest things I've seen recently is this ARK Innovation ETF.  When you looked at it, the actual holdings, like it was part innovation, part hope, part expectations, part Tinker Bell, parts lots of stuff, and that has now converged with an old economy basket.  Look at what it has converged with.  You could have invested in farm equipment, industrial REITs and a company that makes mops, cleaning supplies, and uniforms and been in the same place.  But again, this is a good-
Monica DiCenso:
Arguably a less exciting ride.
Michael Cembalest:
Yes.  I prefer the bottom one to the top one.  But you know, there's a lot of evidence here that we're seeing more signs of capitulation, which is a helpful thing as investors start to look at the landscape here of a-- of a-- I don't want to say post-war environment, because I don't how it’s going to take to get to post-war, because of what’s  taking place.  Next.
Monica DiCenso:
This sounds interesting -- do you think the rout in biotech made sense?  It sold off, along with so much else that’s high-growth.
Michael Cembalest:            Yeah.  Well, we talked about biotech in the outlook this year.  Biotech has gotten shellacked, and the-- it doesn't have more than 25 years of history, in terms of what we now think of as biotech.  And it has underperformed in the broad market as much as it ever has.  And what's interesting, this was less about fears of the reconciliation bill, which had some clauses in there about Medicaid and Medicare being able to renegotiate drug pricing, because that was going to phase in very slowly.  Just a few companies by 2025, maybe a hundred, it would only be for drugs where there was no generic competition.  And now it looks like the reconciliation bill is -- may not happen, or if it does happen it will be in an extremely abbreviated form.  What really happened here was a whole bunch of things.  The drug pipeline had dried up, too much speculation based on mRNA vaccines being applied to all sorts of other diseases, a really badly handled Alzheimer drug approval process by the FDA.  And—but mostly it was just a weak pipeline.  But I think you're getting paid a lot for the R&D that's been put in place to take some risk here.  And so, for example, if you look at the chart on the right, you're now looking at cash flow yields that are at or equal to the tech companies.  And the tech companies have amongst the best cash flow yields in the entire market.  So I put this slide in simply because I know that some of our clients are going to ask us, well, where are the deep value opportunities, where are the things that I should look at if I wanted to deploy some risk over the next couple of months.  And this is one interesting idea.
Monica DiCenso:                I assume we're going to talk more about other parts of the market, but I assume you wouldn't say touch any of these beaten up areas in the emerging markets yet, or Russia or Ukraine or something like that.
Michael Cembalest:            You know, as a matter of principle, it our clients want to talk to some of our traders about Russian assets, but I don't think -- I'm not going to do it.  I don't care how cheap they get.  Next.
Now, these are prewar levels, but the other bright spot is the capital spending data looks good.  And look at the chart on the right.  Right before the war started, we had some pretty good data in both the U.S. and Europe in terms of positive economic surprises.  Some of those will get reversed but some of them won't.  And so I still think that we could see some reasonable GDP growth numbers in the U.S. this year.  Europe is going to be tougher because of just the massive energy price hit that we saw in those earlier charts.
Monica DiCenso:                One quick one there, because this has been very U.S.-focused from an investment standpoint.  You talked about the Fed.  What do you think the ECB does?  Can they make a move here, or—
Michael Cembalest:            I don't know.  They're in a tougher spot than the Fed.  The latest inflation data that we're seeing in Europe are higher than we've seen in a really long time.  Three years ago, the ECB would have been overjoyed to see a signs of pulse in inflation.  Now it's not so easy.  I think they're reaction function is whatever the Fed is divided by two.  Next.
So I just want to wrap up.  We're almost out of time.  But there was something I did in 2014, where we looked at geopolitics.  Geopolitics are usually not the drivers of equity markets three to six months out.  So these are the postwar geopolitical events.  And three to six months out, whatever the pre-conflict trend was, economically, is what kicked in.  And so sometimes you had sell-offs, sometimes it came back.  For example, the line goes down after 9/11, not because of 9/11, but because we were in the middle of the kind of tech collapse.  The line goes down during the Vietnam War because of the Vietnam War and because of deficit spending and things like that.  The exception was the Arab-Israeli War, where you had an economic trajectory that was rickety but stable, but then the spike in energy prices, the collapse of the gold standard, a thousand days of wage and price controls by the Nixon administration, and that geopolitical conflict really did lay the seeds for a pretty horrible seven to ten years, at least seven years after that.  And that's when I remember first trying to understand.  I was only ten, but when I first was trying to understand the basics of energy markets, because our parents could only go to the gas station on odd and even days.  I remember hearing the phrase “energy independence.”  Right?  And Nixon used to talk about energy independence, in between his other various crimes.  And I remember -- and 50 years later, we're here.  So if the United States doesn't have a big recession, it's because we have finally achieved a level of energy independence that the country has been trying to get to for 50 years.  Let's go to the next page.
Look at these charts.  It's about.  A long journey.  But you know, finally these -- when these charts are above zero, we have an energy deficit, you can measure it in dollar terms or you can measure it in megajoules of equivalent energy terms across oil, gas and coal.  And finally on both of these charts the United States is energy independent.  And if the United States weren't energy independent, then I would be much more concerned about the implications of what's going on globally and the risks of tilting the U.S. into recession.
And so what's taking place in the world is another reminder of how important energy independence can be.
So let's wrap up. You know, the near-term equity market reaction is going to be I think negative for a little while.  Most institutional and individual investors, we're not positioned for the combination of what we're getting, which is the biggest land war in Europe since World War II, and also the largest gap between jobs and workers as well.  In other words, the available workers to fill job -- vacant jobs is the largest gap since World War II as well, which is a chart we didn't have room for.  But you know, as usual, it's going to be very difficult to time the bottom, and if we don't end up with a global recession, I think it's going to be very difficult for somebody to take risk off here and add it back at the right lower level.  And a lot of the growth premium, not all of it but a lot of the growth premium has been eliminated, particularly in the “YUC” companies, those young unprofitable companies.  I think it's created an opportunity for the people that are not over their skis on risk to start to benefit from the repricing that's been taking place.  As difficult and as painful as it is, the energy consequences for Europe, because of the policy decisions that they have taken, may result in eventual acceptance of the facts on the ground in the Ukraine, even as those tougher sanctions unrelated to oil and gas remain in place.  And to reiterate the Fed, the Fed is going continue to tighten here, they have a difficult challenge ahead, but the unorthodox nature of the inflation spike, because of the pandemic should help.  We think policy rates are still negative in real terms by the end of the year.  We still think we'll get 3% real GDP this year, although the inflation number by the end of the year, which we thought would be below 3%, looks like it’s going to be above 3%.  And I don't think we can back down to 2.5 until the end of 2023.
Monica DiCenso:                A couple of quick things -- what is the biggest risk to this view that you're summarizing here, just for people to kind of take away?
Michael Cembalest:            That the wage/price spiral in the United States really kicks into overdrive, irrespective of the eventual pay back from declining goods prices.  I mean, that's the biggest risk to the U.S.  And then obviously the consensus opinions over the last few months were wrong about the escalation in the Ukraine, almost at every step.  I think a lot of people have seen by now that Putin has mentioned some kind of high alert for Russian's nuclear arsenal.  And--
Monica DiCenso:                Do you believe that's posturing, or is that—
Michael Cembalest:            I don't know.  It's hard to speculate.  In wars, people make mistakes, right?  When wars are happening, even during the darkest days of the United States conflicts with the old Soviet Union, there was the hot phone.  There was the red phone that was designed to establish lines of communication, to make sure that certain red lines didn't get crossed.  And I'm tempted to believe that those red lines are still functioning, which is how the Europeans and the U.S. have made these carve-outs on the sanctions, to continue to allow agricultural and energy exports out of Russia and the Ukraine.  So-- but in shooting wars, things can happen.  The United States has made military commitments all the way up to Russia's border in the Baltics, and I thought it was interesting recently; just as the Swedes and the Fins are now pulling more in favor of maybe joining NATO, the Russians have responded to the Finns and the Swedes, saying not so fast.  So NATO has got some tough decisions it make about what kind of military commitments it will make and what kind of military commitments that it won't make.  And during wars, mistakes can happen.  And that's obviously a very, very bad scenario for humanity, in addition to a bad scenario for markets.
Monica DiCenso:                One last one you that could probably be a call in and of itself, we talk about shooting wars, nuclear.  How does cyber play in, because that makes this war different than the past, I think many people would argue.
Michael Cembalest:            We'll see.  There are lots of cyber, anticyber, and anti-anticyber activities going on, on all sides right now.  I would watch the electricity grids in Western Europe for potential cyber activity.  And, you know, I don't think -- I think when you look at Stuxnet and the other things that have taken place, you don't generally find out about them until 18 to 24 months later.  So it's very hard for me to make an assessment of some of the cyber war that's taking place in real time.
Let me show one more slide, in case I haven't, you know, gone too far already.  I'm only doing this because of how many questions I get everywhere I go.  One day we may be discussing Taiwan, and in the same way that we're revisiting the history and the wisdom of NATO's embrace of the Ukraine without the intention of protecting it during that process, we may one day be reevaluating the wisdom of allowing China and accepting China into the World Trade Organization in the early 2000s.  Here you see a chart on the Chinese incursions on Taiwanese air space.  But that, Monica, is a discussion for another day.
Monica DiCenso:                Would you say, is that our topic for next year?  I hope not, in 12 months, that we're sitting here –
Michael Cembalest:             I hope not as well.  I want to echo—I want to close the call by echoing what Kathryn said in the very beginning, which, is, you know, God help the Ukraine.  So thank you all very much for -- or God help Ukraine.  I've been asked not to use the ""the.""  I apologize for that, and I promise I will not do it again.  The word ""the"" implies that it's simply an autonomous region of another country rather than it's own country.  So god bless Ukraine.  Thank you all for dialing into this call, and I look forward to talking to you again soon.
Monica DiCenso:                Thank you.  Kathryn, throw it back to you.

We start with a summary of the energy landscape, including the energy crisis in Europe, the recovery in the oil & gas sector and a warning label on industrial electrification and carbon sequestration forecasts. We continue with three topics on electrification, which is the foundation of many deep decarbonization plans: electric vehicle adoption by gasoline super-users, the transmission quagmire and bans on combustion of fossil fuels for heating in favor of electric heat pumps. We then conduct a detailed review of the hydrogen economy, whose liftoff is still many years away. We conclude with deep decarbonization plans for China, whose carbon intensity and emissions levels are the highest in the world.Electrification as a means to decarbonize energy useTransmission: The US transmission quagmire shows little sign of changing. Interconnection queues are swamped, and both landowners and environmental groups are blocking critical renewable projects in the absence of Federal intervention
Gasoline super-users: The top 10% of US gasoline super-users consume almost one third of all US gasoline. Are there better ways of incentivizing them to switch to electric vehicles than current policy? And what is the impact of rising metals prices on EV battery costs and supply chains?
Fossil fuel bans, heat pumps and electrification of winter heating: What will happen to transmission grids at times of peak loads if no backup heating systems are in place? And what about the pace of change if bans on fossil fuels only apply to new buildings?Whydrogen?Hydrogen use cases may be much narrower than advertised, and the timeline is a very long one. Optimists see multiple hydrogen adoption pathways in power generation, pipelines, steel production, home heating, marine shipping, rail and aviation; we take a closer and more skeptical lookContact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is projected to result in one of the largest refugee crises in decades with 4-5 million people displaced
1
;long-lasting water, air and ground pollution in Ukraine; and 90% of Ukraine’s population facing poverty and extreme economic hardship if the war drags on to the end of 2022
2
.  For anyone surprised that Russia is imposing this brutal misery on Ukraine, don’t be: there’s ample precedent for it.  As shown below, the Holodomor famine imposed by Russia on Ukraine in the 1930’s dwarfs other famines in terms of severity and is another example of Russian subjugation of Ukraine by any means necessary
3
.As I wrote in the last two notes, I’m dubious of Europe’s ability to sharply reduce reliance on Russian energy given the need for rapid LNG build-outs, wind/solar/heat pump adoption that’s way above trend, non-existent hydrogen infrastructure and maximizing nuclear.  But if Europe pulled it off, Russia’s share of world GDP would shrink further (see chart) at which point it could essentially turn into an energy vassal state for China.  China has been Russia’s largest trading partner for over a decade, while Russia accounts for just 2% of Chinese exports.How bad is the selloff? Tracking opportunities for bottom fishing investors
The first chart sends a consistent message on US equities
4
: a large correction took place, and if there is no US recession, the March 8
th
low was probably a market bottom as it is similar in magnitude to other large selloffs.  If there is a US recession, the average stock decline from peak levels suggests further downside.  I consider recession risk to be a close call given rising energy prices, rising credit spreads, rising wages, supply shortages that are now exacerbated by the war and a rapid about-face from the Fed designed to cool things down via higher interest rates (including one or more 50 basis point hikes this year).  But I believe the US will make it through without a recession.  The second chart is another barometer for bottom-fishing investors: it shows how the average stock sold off much more sharply than its respective index.  Since March 8
th
, the US equity indices shown below have risen by 6%-9%.While there has been a lot of damage done to the average stock, the P/E ratio of the 25 stocks with the largest market cap is still elevated compared to history, a reflection of investor confidence in the earnings resilience of these companies
5
.  And while hedge fund leverage has come down, it has not collapsed as much as it usually does during recessions.    As for institutional long-only asset managers, CFTC futures positions in the S&P 500 and NASDAQ are not quite at 2018 and 2020 lows but are approaching them, while small cap futures positions are now at the lowest levels since the 2008 financial crisis.Similar conclusions can be drawn from credit spreads:
while spreads have widened, they are nowhere near levels typically seen during recessions.In contrast, the selloff in China (particularly in the internet sector) is pricing in a lot of adverse news.
Investors should now assume the elimination of all Chinese ADRs and higher costs of capital for Chinese companies, and the lockdowns in Shenzhen and Shanghai are tougher than I expected they would be.  However, China has tightened monetary, fiscal and regulatory conditions for the last year and a half, and now has a larger reservoir of stimulus ammunition if they choose to use it.  I think they will, since the Communist Party leadership established a 5.5% growth target for this year.How bad is the European growth outlook?
Europe is one of the most efficient places on earth regarding energy consumed per unit of GDP (see first chart). Unfortunately, current energy and other producer price increases in Europe are so large as to overwhelm most energy efficiency gains. This has been a large commodity shock: a basket of energy, industry and precious metals, agriculture and livestock is up ~80% since the fall of 2019, similar to the commodity price shocks during the 1973/1974 OPEC oil embargo era and the second oil shock in 1979/1980.
As shown below, European electricity and natural gas prices have quadrupled.  In addition, Europe is facing a massive producer price shock: the second chart shows the gap between producer and consumer prices.
At some point, the surge in producer prices in Europe either gets absorbed by companies through lower margins, reduced hiring and less capital spending, or it gets passed on to consumers, triggering higher CPI and tighter policy from central banks
.  Since 1948 when the data begins, the US has not experienced anything like the producer price shock that Europe is experiencing now.  It looks like a recession in Europe will be the inevitable result.  European equities are priced at ~13x with earnings expected to be flat in 2022; during European recessions, earnings can fall 25% with P/E ratios falling below 10x.  So, it’s hard to argue that Europe is very good value here unless there is an unexpectedly quick end to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.How bad are rising metals prices for the EV industry?
There are wild short squeezes and mayhem reportedly taking place in nickel markets, so current price levels may not last long.  But if metals price increases since early 2020 are sustained, what could happen to EV prices due to rising battery costs?  Using metals composition of EV batteries from Argonne National Labs and the latest metals prices (including an assumed post-squeeze decline in nickel prices to $26,500 per metric ton), I took a look. I analyzed a hypothetical 60 kWh battery across three chemistry types: Lithium Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC), Lithium Nickel Cobalt Aluminum (NCA) and Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP).  The table shows battery chemistry by auto manufacturer; LFP batteries are used by Tesla and Chinese EV makers, while the rest mostly use NMC at least for now.  LFP batteries are typically cheaper but have lower energy densities.   China manufactures most LFP batteries while Samsung and LG Chem produce most NMC batteries.
Estimated LFP battery costs have risen by ~$500 since January 2020, mostly due to rising copper prices; this increase seems manageable as a % of vehicle cost.  In contrast, estimated NMC and NCA battery costs increased by ~$1,500 since January 2020 with a large part of that increase occurring this year due to rising nickel and cobalt prices.  For all EVs, there could be another $500 EV cost increase due to incremental copper and aluminum used for non-battery purposes in excess of amounts needed in internal combustion engine cars.
The bottom line:  there may be some sticker shock for EVs reliant on nickel and cobalt, but not for EVs using LFP chemistry
.   Of course, EV owners would save even more on fuel if the gap between gasoline and electricity costs per mile is
sustained
6
I’ve been a skeptic on US EV adoption rates (just 2% of sales last year), and now there’s another headwind that NMC-EVs face that might require even more generous Federal subsidies.How bad is the COVID situation in Hong Kong?  And a comment from Mister Ed on ivermectin
I wrote in February about a market research firm I subscribe to whose principal researcher does not believe in the efficacy of COVID vaccines.  Their founders are French but are based in Hong Kong given what they often criticize as
creeping French government control of industry
(yes, the ironies are too numerous to mention).  In any case, if his vaccine skepticism is influenced by the situation in Hong Kong, he should take a closer look.
Current Hong Kong COVID mortality rates are ~4x peak US levels which took place last year. There are two primary reasons for this, in my view.  First, as shown in the table, for some strange reason, vaccination rates in Hong Kong are inverted relative to risk (age).  In other words, middle aged people are vaccinated at a much higher rate than older people.  Second, around half of the people in Hong Kong are vaccinated with CoronaVac, a vaccine produced by Beijing-based Sinovac.  Among those over 80, CoronaVac is only 45% effective against mortality
7
. I don’t have a direct comparison for 80+, but the latest mRNA vaccine efficacy metric for the 65+ US population is 70%-80% according to Oakland’s Public Health Institute.
China is reportedly working on its own mRNA vaccine which is still in Phase III trials. One such Chinese company was added to the US Federal Trade restricted list given its alleged use of biotechnology to support activities such as “brain control weaponry” (!!). Separately, BioNTech and its Chinese partner have completed their own trials but their mRNA vaccine has not been approved yet by Chinese authorities.The latest on ivermectin: “Neigh”, says Mister Ed
A recent clinical trial in Brazil evaluated the effects of ivermectin when administered to those who tested positive for COVID and were at risk of severe disease. Half of the ~1,400 patients were prescribed ivermectin for three days, and then tracked for 28 days to determine whether they were hospitalized and if they cleared the virus faster than patients who received placebo pills. The trial concluded that
ivermectin did not improve patient outcomes
, either in terms of reduced hospitalizations or increased speed of recovery
8
.
As a reminder: ivermectin is a horse de-worming drug but is also a very effective drug for humans infected with certain parasites (its creators won the Nobel Prize for it in 2015).  When used for parasitic treatment, ivermectin is given as a one-time dose; the “ivermectin for COVID” crowd are often taking it twice a week even though there is no safety data on prolonged use.
None of my analysts understood the Mister Ed reference since they did not know who he was.  The cultural divide between my generation and theirs is unbridgeable.  Maybe it’s time for me to be put out to pasture.1

Assuming 25 mpg for a gasoline car, 3 miles per kWh for an EV, $4 gasoline, 14 cents per kWh for electricity and 11,000 miles driven per year, EV owners would save ~$1,250 per year in fuel expenses.  Comparing this annual amount to the incremental upfront cost of an EV over a gasoline car yields the payback period.

FEMALE VOICE:  This podcast has been prepared exclusively for institutional, wholesale, professional clients, and qualified investors only as defined by local laws and regulations.  Please read other important information, which can be found on the link at the end of the podcast episode.
MR. MICHAEL CEMBALEST:  Good morning everybody, this is the late March Eye on the Market podcast.  Topics this week all have to do with surveying the damage, surveying the damage from Russia’s war on Ukraine, surveying the damage to equity markets and some bottom-fishing opportunities for investors, surveying the recession outlook in Europe due to rising energy prices, surveying the impact of rising metals prices on EV battery costs, and surveying the damage in Hong Kong from the COVID situation.
So I just want to start for a minute on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.  This is creating one of the largest refugee crises in decades.  There’s going to be some long-lasting water, air, and ground pollution in Ukraine, and 90% of the people that live there could face poverty or hardship by the end of the year.
If anybody is surprised that Russia is imposing this kind of misery on Ukraine, you shouldn’t be.  There’s ample precedent for it.  We spent some time looking through the history of famines.  And the famine imposed by Russia on Ukraine for political reasons in the 1930s dwarfs other famines in terms of severity and is a previous example of Russian subjugation of the Ukraine by any means necessary.
It’s kind of remarkable to see this chart.  The death rate from the Russian-imposed famine on the Ukraine dwarfs the Irish potato famine, the North Korean famine, famines in India, and even the Great Leap Forward famine in China in the late 1950s.  Larger numbers of people died in China from that famine, but on a rate per thousand people, the Ukraine famine imposed by Russia was the worst one.
So as we wrote in the last two notes, I’m dubious of Europe’s ability to sharply reduce its energy reliance on Russia.  I mean the things that would need to be done, rapid LNG buildouts of gasification of liquid faction facilities, solar, wind, and heat pump adoption that’s way above trend, exploiting non-existent hydrogen infrastructure and rebuilding or regaining access to shuttered nuclear facilities, all those things are very difficult to do.  But if Russia pulled it off, but if Europe were able to pull this off, Russia’s share of world GDP would shrink even further below the roughly 2% level that it’s at now.  We have a chart in here that shows Russia and the USSR share of world GDP since 1820.  And without European purchases of Russian energy, Russia could easily just turn into a vassal state that provides energy just to China.
In terms of surveying the damage to equity markets, there was a bunch of research that was done by J.P. Morgan’s investment bank last week, and I thought it was pretty good, so I replicated some of it here.  The charts all send a consistent message.  There was a very large selloff that took place.  And if there’s no recession in the United States, the March 8
th
low is probably the bottom.  If there is a recession, the average stock market decline would suggest further downside.
But I consider the recession call to be a close one.  I still think the US will make it through without a recession.  For sure growth is going to take a hit, energy prices are going up, credit spreads, wages, supply shortages, and rising interest rates.  There’s no question that housing is going to slow markedly.  But something in the neighborhood of 1.5 to 2% seems like the kind of growth shock the US will experience here.  And if that’s the case, March 8
th
may have been the bottom for this particular selloff.
And the opportunities in individual stocks are even more pronounced at the index level for a lot of large and small-cap, and NASDAQ stocks are down 35, 40, 50, 60% way more than the indexes themselves.  And hedge fund leverages come down; futures positions of long-only asset managers have come down.  So most of the signals that we look at have come down.  The only thing that hasn’t come down that much is the PE ratio of the 25 largest stocks in the market.  The mega-cap stocks, of course the valuations have declined but are still expensive on any kind of historical basis.  So for anybody looking to do bottom fishing, it looks like the opportunities are outside those mega-cap names.
We’ve got some information here on credit spreads as well.  Similar message, while spreads have widened, they are nowhere near the levels that are seen during recessions.  Now if you are really interested in aggressive bottom fishing, the Chinese equity markets are pricing in probably more bad news than any place.  There’s a chart that we show here that tracks the China Internet Index, kind of looks like the NASDAQ from 1999 to 2004.
The Chinese equity drawdowns have been pretty severe.  They have been tightening monetary, fiscal, and regulatory conditions for the last year and a half.  So they’ve got some accumulated stimulus ammunition if they choose to use it.  And I think they will since the Communist party has established around a 5.5% growth target for the year, and I don’t see how they’re going to reach that unless they start to deploy some stimulus.  So in addition to some of the beaten down names in US markets for the intrepid, there appear to be some opportunities in China as well, although it would probably take 18 to 24 months to figure out after the fact if that made any sense.
One place I would not be tempted to bottom fish is Europe.  Europe is almost certainly headed for recession.  Now Europe is one of the most energy-efficient places on earth if you look at energy consumed per unit of GDP.  Europe in general is lower than China, lower than the US, lower than Canada, lower than Japan.  Europe is a very energy-efficient place per unit of growth.  Unfortunately, the commodity price shock has been so huge that it’s overwhelmed the benefit of those energy efficiencies.  And no matter how energy efficient you are, if electricity and natural gas prices are going to quadruple, you’re going to have a problem.  And that’s what’s happened in Europe.
They’re also facing a massive, massive producer price shock.  And there’s a chart in here that shows that producer prices have soared something like 25% higher than consumer prices.  In other words, that gap has to go somewhere.  So either companies are going to take a huge hit in terms of declining margins, hiring, and capital spending, or they’re going to have to pass that onto consumers and trigger higher CPI and tighter policy from the ECB.
So I look back to 1950.  The US has never experienced anything like the producer price shock that Europe is experiencing right now.  And the recession in Europe is likely to be the inevitable result.  Europe has sold off.  It’s priced at about 13 times earnings, with earnings expected to be flat this year.  But during European recessions, earnings can fall 25%, and PE ratios can fall below 10.  So it’s hard to argue that Europe’s a good value here unless there’s an unexpectedly quick end to the conflict in Ukraine.
We’ll go into more of the details in the energy paper later this year.  But one of the consequences of Russia’s invasion has been a surge in metals prices.  Everything from lithium to nickel, aluminum, copper, iron, steel have all gone up by 50% or 250% since January 2020.  And there’s this page in this week’s Eye on the Market that looks at the impact on theoretical battery prices for electric vehicles and how those increased metals prices would eventually feed through - -.  And we look at different auto manufacturers, different battery compositions, and there are some big differences there.  For example, Tesla in China use a lithium ion phosphate battery that does not have nickel and cobalt in it.  So those battery prices haven’t gone up as much as they have for some of the other auto manufacturers.
The bottom line is that depending upon the battery chemistry, the metals prices have created either a $500 or $2,500 increase in the estimated economic cost of a vehicle.  And maybe plus a few hundred dollars more for incremental copper and aluminum that has nothing to do with the battery, but gets used a lot in EVs compared to traditional cars.
So another headwind essentially for EV adoption.  Of course most EV owners could expect to save a lot of fuel costs if gasoline and electricity prices stay where they are.  Using some standard assumptions on mileage, miles driven, electricity costs, gasoline costs, EV owners would typically save somewhere between 1,000 and $1,500 a year in fuel expenses.  So if you compare that to the incremental cost of an EV up front over a gasoline car, you can figure out the payback period.
But the bottom line is that there has been for some of the EVs, the ones that use the nickel, manganese, cobalt oxide battery approach, there’s been a bit of a price shock here that might have to be addressed through even more general, generous federal subsidies in both the US and in Europe in order for those EV adoption rates to stay on trend.
The last two topics this week have to do with COVID.  One of the big shock, I mean the chart here, you just have to see it to be believe it, for the last two years, Hong Kong COVID mortality was basically nonexistent.  We didn’t even plot it because it was so close to zero.  And now the COVID mortality rate in Hong Kong has soared and is now around four times higher than the peak mortality rate in the US that took place a little over a year ago, which is wild.
So how do you explain this?  Well to me, I think there’s two factors going on.  First, for some reason, and no one’s been able to explain to me, vaccination rates in Hong Kong are inverted relative to age.  In other words, the middle-aged people are vaccinated at a much higher rate of about 90 to 93%, and it drops all the way to 35% for people 80-plus.  So how do you end up with a public health service that does that?  It’s very strange.
Second, about half the people in Hong Kong are vaccinated with CoronaVac, which is a vaccine produced by a Chinese company called Sinovac.  According to some research we’ve seen, CoronaVac’s only 45% effective against mortality, which is 30 to 40% lower than the efficacy rates seen for the mRNA vaccines.  So low vaccination rates of old people and less effective vaccines explain part of it.  But I don’t know that I would be able to explain all of it given the increasingly difficult information flow issues going on in Hong Kong and China as well.
So China is reportedly working on its own mRNA vaccine, still in phase three trials.  Interestingly, one of the companies involved was added to the US federal trade restricted list given its alleged use of biotechnology to support brain control weaponry.  So it’s a strange world that we live in.
Last quick COVID topic for the week is on ivermectin.  You’re probably aware of ivermectin.  It’s often used as a horse deworming drug but is also an effective drug used for humans that get infected with certain parasites.  The thing is when it gets used for parasitic treatment, it’s given as a one-time dose.  And the people using it for COVID are taking it twice a week, even though there’s absolutely no safety data on that kind of protocol.
Anyway, so a recent clinical trial in Brazil evaluated ivermectin versus a placebo and found absolutely no benefit in terms of patient outcomes of reduced hospitalizations or increased speed of recovery.  So I was willing to be open-minded about it pending a broad study.  But now that one’s been completed, I think we have the answer that ivermectin is not super-helpful.  And so I mentioned to my team that the verdict should be described as a neigh from Mr. Ed.  They completely didn’t know who Mr. Ed was, which is maybe a sign that it’s getting close for me to think about retirement.  Anyway, thank you very much for listening, and I’ll talk to you next time, thank you.

Russia.
This interview in Italian daily Corriere della Serra is a disturbing look at the world according to Russia, as per Putin/Yeltsin advisor Sergey Karaganov. It’s entitled “
We are at war with the West. The European security order is illegitimate
”. In addition to Karaganov’s arguably distorted and at times absurd view of history, note his belief that Russia will eventually launch attacks on European countries supplying arms to Ukraine.
Market update.
As I wrote in the March
Eye on the Market
, we expect the March 15 equity market lows to hold as long as there is no US recession. Some recession indicators are rising: first inverted 2-year to 30-year yield curve since 2007; a collapse in consumer sentiment to one of the lowest levels in 70 years; declining small business surveys; and ISM business survey orders falling below inventory levels for the first time since the expansion began. In addition, more signs of prolonged goods shortages and inflation: China’s supply chain delays and spikes in anchored containerships due to COVID, and additional sanctions on Russia in response to what has been described as executions, torture and other war crimes committed by Russian soldiers. Even so, I think a low growth period in 2022 in the US is more likely than a recession. Labor markets are very tight (there has never been a recession without a large spike in jobless claims), household and corporate balance sheets are in very good shape, and the release of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve lowers risk of recession in the near term (though it’s still a bullish sign for oil prices in the medium term). US recession risks look higher for 2023-2024.
The Tide Goes Out: Growth Trade Aftermath
. As of February 28
th
, the median NASDAQ stock was down ~40% from its prior peak, a consequence of rising interest rates and the unsustainable increase in unprofitable companies. These declines are large but pale in comparison to the 2001-2002 selloff when the median NASDAQ stock was down ~75% from its peak, and when growth outperformance vs value was completely erased (this time growth has only given up a modest amount of its outperformance vs value). In this note, we look at asset allocation, equity mutual fund and hedge fund performance after the growth stock selloff.Past performance is no guarantee of future results. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.Analysis summary: a growth allocation generated substantial excess returns in pro-forma portfolios from 2017 to Feb 2022, even after the selloff. However, the four largest mega-stocks (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Google) accounted for almost half of these excess returns. Furthermore, only top quartile equity mutual fund and hedge fund managers delivered excess returns versus their growth benchmarks.
Asset Allocation: still a clear benefit from growth stock exposures in portfolios
To assess the benefit of an allocation to growth in equity portfolios, we compare an investment in the Russell 1000 Growth Index and the NASDAQ to other equity alternatives such as the S&P 500, Value stocks, Europe, US/Global Small Cap and Emerging Markets. The timeframe is of course a critical decision; looking back at our investment commentary over the last few years, I picked January 2017 as a starting point since that’s when we began to focus on the higher revenue growth and profit margins of tech and healthcare in a slower growth world. Different starting dates would of course yield different results.Results
. Through the end of February 2022, an allocation to growth generated higher returns than the other options shown with comparable levels of volatility. However,
almost 50% of growth’s outperformance vs value was derived from exposure to the largest four stocks
(AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, GOOG). For investors executing this view through passive index products, the performance discussion would stop here other than having to account for passive index fees which are generally comparable across the indexes shown

.Past performance is no guarantee of future results. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.Growth equity mutual funds: outperformance is scarce as diversification hurt returns
Assessing mutual fund performance is a straightforward exercise:
Use Morningstar to obtain a universe of funds in the Large Cap Growth category, excluding passive products
Narrow to those funds with performance from Jan 2017 to Feb 2022. This does create a survivorship bias issue since we ignore funds that used to be in this category but dropped out for whatever reason
Use the lowest fee share class for each fund as a proxy for its Institutional share class, and compute cumulative performance from 2017-2022
Compute excess returns for each fund relative to its stated benchmark. Most growth managers use the Russell 1000 Growth Index; others use the S&P 500 and a few use the Russell 3000 Growth Index
Results
. Most funds with a R1000 Growth benchmark underperformed over this period. Many may have been reluctant to hold index-weight positions in the four largest stocks whose performance more than doubled the performance of growth stocks in recent years. Managers may also have been discouraged from doing so for regulatory reasons (see box). In March, the largest weights in the R1000 Growth index were AAPL 12.5%, MSFT 10.8%, AMZN 6.6%, GOOG 6.4%.
As a result, just holding market weight positions would imply 36% in these four stocks, above the 25% diversification threshold that many mutual funds seek to comply with
2
, requiring them to be structurally underweight.
As shown in the third chart, we estimate the cost of the diversification rule applied to the Russell 1000 Growth Index to be ~15% over the time horizon.Diversification Rule of the 1940 Investment Company Act
Many 40 Act mutual fund managers seek to meet a
diversification test
which requires positions that are over 5% to sum to less than 25% of the fund. [Section 5-b-1]
Certain investor types such as Defined Contribution plans generally prefer funds that pass the diversification test.
If a diversified fund actively breaches the threshold, any securities purchased that caused the violation would need to be sold. Any losses would be reimbursed to the fund while any gains would be kept by the fund.Past performance is no guarantee of future results. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.In contrast, most growth mutual funds using an S&P 500 benchmark
outperformed
. This may reflect the presence of core managers whose growth tilt was so high as to push them into Morningstar’s growth category, but the manager still benchmarks their performance to the S&P 500 Index. Whether investors give managers with a strong growth tilt credit for outperformance vs a core benchmark is up to them. Not sure I would.Performance was mixed for the smaller number of mutual funds categorized by Morningstar as “growth” and who benchmark their performance to the Russell 3000 Growth Index. Given the underperformance of small cap shown on page 2 over this period, any manager with a structural underweight to small cap growth would have generated substantial excess returns over benchmark.
For legal and compliance reasons, I cannot cite JP Morgan Asset Management’s large cap growth performance; you will have to look that up on your own.
Past performance is no guarantee of future results. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.
Hedge fund performance: plenty of assumptions and triangulation required
Measuring long only equity and fixed income mutual fund performance against stated benchmarks is a simple process. The prior section is one example of that.
As for private equity and venture capital, the development of the LP-sourced Burgiss performance database now allows for proper time-weighted performance measurement versus a variety of public equity market benchmarks without having to worry about survivorship bias or selective reporting. We discussed this in last year’s
deep dive on private equity and venture capital
. There is no easy answer to the question of what kind of illiquidity premium is “fair” to investors, but at least the magnitude of what investors earn in private equity and venture capital relative to public equity markets is much clearer.
In contrast, deciding whether a given hedge fund has performed well or not relative to its opportunity set is one of the more complicated questions in investment finance
. The “LIBOR plus a spread” benchmark and the HFRI benchmarks that were popular in the 1990’s are used less often now, and the “stock/bond mix” benchmark approach is used less often as well. When investors have look-through access to a hedge fund’s exposures on a daily or weekly basis, they can construct a customized benchmark based on market factors to assess performance. But that is not a viable option when doing industry-level analysis with monthly data.
As a result, I’m going to use a simple approach to benchmark hedge fund performance
. Many growth long-short hedge funds have “observed market betas” of ~0.45 relative to the Russell 1000 Growth index. In other words, over the long run their returns rise and fall at 45% of the rate of the Russell Index itself. So, we use 0.45 of the Russell 1000 Growth as a benchmark for growth long short hedge funds in this analysis. We sometimes look at a NASDAQ benchmark as well but since its performance is almost identical to the R1000 Growth Index, we only show the R1000 Growth benchmark in the charts and tables that follow. Note in the last chart how the beta-adjusted R1000 Growth benchmark is similar to a 50% S&P 500 / 50% Barclays Aggregate benchmark.Then there’s the challenge of
obtaining
hedge fund performance data in the first place
Unlike the Burgiss database of LP-sourced private equity and venture capital flows, no such database exists for hedge funds. There are several aggregators that compile hedge fund performance but they all rely on hedge funds to consistently report their performance, and
many of the largest hedge funds simply have no interest in doing that
. Hedge fund managers provide performance history to investors considering an allocation, but such data is often subject to non-disclosure agreements that prevent it from being used for research publications like this one.
Once we obtain hedge fund performance data, there are still issues that make returns harder to compare. Some managers have
large private exposures
as high as 50% of the fund’s NAV. When public equity markets decline, private exposures are often not repriced as quickly, making comparisons across funds harder. And of course,
gross and net leverage differ
across funds as well.
As a result, we have to triangulate and use
four separate self-reported universes of hedge fund monthly returns from January 2017 to February 2022
3
. Our Asset Management's Hedge Fund Due Diligence team considers the first two more indicative of an institutional peer group, and shares the same reservations I have regarding the HFR dataset due to the lack of data from some of the largest well known funds.
Long-short hedge funds categorized by PivotalPath as “Tech-focused”
Long-short generalist growth hedge funds identified by JP Morgan Asset Management’s Hedge Fund Due Diligence team as “Tiger Cubs” in the PivotalPath database
4
Long-short hedge funds categorized by HFR as “Technology” or “Healthcare” (note: we do not use the HFR Equity Hedge Growth category since it includes a lot of hedge funds investing in Emerging Markets)
Long-short hedge funds in the eVestment database with observed market betas of at least 0.45 vs the S&P 500 Growth Index (eVestment does not have a Growth category, which is why we chose this method)
For each hedge fund universe, we identify the median, 75
th
percentile and 25
th
percentile manager
5
. For each of these managers, we show annualized returns, annualized volatility, return/risk, the fund’s current NAV vs peak levels (i.e., drawdown) and its correlation with the Russell 1000 Growth Index.
Are you excited yet? I am.
Hedge fund performance based on PivotalPath data
PivotalPath has data for 104 Technology long-short funds. However, many of these funds do not have consistent monthly data over our time horizon. We ended up with just 27 that we could analyze out of the original 104; some excluded funds began after January 2017, while others stopped reporting before February 2022. Data limitations are a frustrating and inescapable part of the hedge fund landscape.
The performance distribution looks “normal”: median Technology long-short hedge fund returns were close to our beta-adjusted growth benchmarks and also generated higher risk-adjusted returns. The 75
th
percentile manager’s outperformance was slightly larger than the 25
th
percentile manager’s underperformance.Past performance is no guarantee of future results. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.We then analyzed the 29 funds in the PivotalPath dataset that our Hedge Fund Due Diligence team identified as generalist growth-oriented “Tiger Cub” descendants of the original Tiger fund. However, PivotalPath only has consistent monthly performance from Jan 2017 to Feb 2022 for 12 of them.
The 75
th
percentile Tiger Cub fund kept pace with our Russell benchmark, while the median manager experienced a correction in Q1 2022 that left the fund well below it. The 25
th
percentile Tiger Cub manager generated weak performance with high levels of volatility relative to returns. Some Tiger Cub funds exhibit very high volatility: one such fund generated very high returns (above the 75
th
percentile over the time horizon) but also generated very high volatility (16%) and experienced a sharp selloff whose drawdown reached 37% by February 2022 (i.e., current value / peak value of 63%). This fund has reportedly experienced further large drawdowns in March despite the recovery in the Russell 1000 Growth Index.Past performance is no guarantee of future results. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.Hedge fund performance based on HFR and eVestment data
We were able to analyze 55 out of 96 long short hedge funds in the HFR dataset. As a reminder, we analyzed long-short hedge funds that were categorized by HFR as Technology or Healthcare. The results are similar to the PivotalPath Technology dataset: median manager close to beta-adjusted benchmark, with 75
th
and 25
th
percentile managers distributed on either side of them. Also similar: the 75
th
percentile manager outperformed by more than the 25
th
percentile manager underperformed. But to reiterate, we have concerns about the relevance of this dataset to institutional investors given which funds self-report.The eVestment database has a lower rate of missing performance data than the other three datasets. We were able to analyze 231 out of 339 funds in their database. As a reminder, these funds were selected since they exhibited a beta to the S&P 500 Growth Index of at least 0.45 over the last two years. The results in most respects are almost identical to the HFR dataset results shown above.Past performance is no guarantee of future results. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.Wrapping up: growth generated substantial asset allocation returns from 2017 to Feb 2022, but only top quartile equity and hedge fund managers delivered excess returns versus growth benchmarks
Asset allocation
. An allocation to growth in portfolios since 2017 generated benefits in portfolios despite the selloff that took place through February 2022
Equity mutual funds
. Most growth mutual funds underperformed the R1000 Growth Index during this period. We believe that this reflects in part mutual fund manager reluctance/inability to hold market weight positions in the largest four stocks which outperformed the rest of the equity market by 300% from 2017 to February 2022, one of the largest such outperformance periods in history
Hedge fund performance
Median manager
. Most median hedge fund managers tracked our beta-adjusted growth benchmarks even though they did not hold market-weight positions in the four largest stocks. The Tiger Cub manager was the exception, trailing the benchmark instead
Underperforming managers
. The 25
th
percentile hedge fund managers all lagged our benchmark, and also generated from 1% to 5% higher volatility
Outperforming managers
. The 75
th
percentile managers in three of the datasets generated large returns vs our benchmarks; the exception was the 75
th
percentile Tiger Cub fund which tracked the benchmark insteadSource: PivotalPath, HFR, eVestment, JPMAM. February 2022.Volatility
. Some hedge funds that experienced large drawdowns this year accumulated high prior returns, such that long term investors were still ahead of our benchmarks. This context is often missing from press articles
6
. However, volatility and risk may still be understated for funds with large private exposures
Benchmarks.
Using a stock-bond mix or a beta-adjusted equity index is a simple approach that does not take into account the investment style of the manager. Hedge fund researchers often take performance measurement analysis to a deeper level to determine what a fund is doing with its capital, and measuring performance relative to a customized benchmark (see Appendix I). Such an approach is beyond the scope of our industry wide analysis given the limitation of monthly returns
Data issues
. Selective reporting, survivorship bias and lack of comparability cloud the results. For the PivotalPath dataset, we were only able to analyze less than half the managers that existed during the time horizon due to missing data. Appendix II reviews the performance of partial managers which we excludedAppendix I: Factor based hedge fund performance analysis
A large institutional investor can often obtain high frequency returns and leverage directly from a hedge fund. Hedge fund research teams can then regress these returns against market “factors” such as price-to-book, cash flow to enterprise value, price momentum, low volatility, etc. Each factor is constructed as a miniature long-short position; i.e. a price-to-book factor would show the daily returns on a portfolio that owned the “cheapest” stocks (lowest price to book) and was short the most expensive stocks (highest price to book).
If a hedge fund’s returns are highly correlated with one or more factors over time, that set of factors can be used as a benchmark with any residual performance differences measuring the manager’s excess return vs benchmark. The more customized a factor based benchmark is, the more the hedge fund is being measured against their
assumed
opportunity set. As a result, the benefit or penalty from investing in low volatility or low price to book stocks is assumed to be an asset allocation decision that the manager is not responsible for.
Other approaches require
position-level transparency
, which would allow for a hedge fund researcher to determine how much the fund made from market exposure, sector, country and style preferences, with any residual representing manager excess return.
Appendix II: Hedge fund survivorship bias and missing data
There’s not much we can do about missing data. But for hedge funds we excluded due to incomplete data, we can at least see if there is any performance skew for returns they
did
report during the 2017-2022 time horizon. As shown below,
we unsurprisingly found a modest bias towards outperformance in the partial returns that these excluded managers did report.
But the missing data remains a mystery, which is why we excluded these managers and their partial returns in the overall analysis.
Number of excluded funds out/underperforming R1000 Growth based on their partially reported returns1
ETF fees generally range from 3 to 20 basis points for US equity ETFs. Global Small Cap ETF fees are around 45 basis points, and Emerging Market ETF fees are closer to 70 basis points.
2
A mutual fund benchmarked to the S&P 500 Growth Index would face a similar problem: AAPL 14%, MSFT 12%, AMZN 7% and GOOG 8%. In other words, 41% of the index and well above the 25% threshold.
3
While the Russell 1000 Growth Index rose by ~4% in March, some hedge funds may trail the beta-adjusted benchmark. The reasons: large caps outperformed small caps in March (often a headwind for hedge funds), an index of widely owned hedge fund positions was up 1% while a basket of stocks with the highest short interest rose by 6%, and while growth outperformed value, telecommunications services were up less than 1%. Finally, hedge funds with large private positions may still need to mark some of them down.
4
PivotalPath does not have every manager we know to be a Tiger Cub descendent, but they do have what we consider to be a large representative sample.
5
We equal-weight rather than asset-weight funds. As a result, we may include smaller funds with less industry impact. Asset-weighting can be problematic: what about a fund with large assets under management (AUM) at inception which then underperforms and suffers substantial outflows? If the ending AUM is used, it understates their impact. The same problem exists using inception AUM for managers that accumulate assets. Time-weighted AUM is better than using inception or ending AUM; but equal weighting is our preferred approach.

One example: “
Selling in speculative tech stocks knocks Tiger Cub hedge funds

MR. MICHAEL CEMBALEST:  Good afternoon everyone, welcome to the April 2022 Eye on the Market podcast.  This month’s piece is called The Tide Goes Out, because we’re looking at the aftermath of the growth trade now that there’s been a selloff in growth stocks.  At the end of February, the median NASDAQ stock was down around 40% from its prior peak.  Those numbers are a little bit better now, so we do the analysis at the end of February, ‘cause we want to capture the most recent lows.  Those median declines of 40% are large.  Of course they pale in comparison to 2022 when at the end of the selloff, the median NASDAQ stock was down around 75% from its prior peak.  And back then, all of the growth outperformance versus value was completely erased.  This time around, growth has only given up around a quarter of a third of its outperformance versus value.
Anyway, I thought the end of February was a good time to look at the aftermath of the growth trade and specifically at asset allocation, equity mutual fund and hedge fund performance after this selloff took place.  We start out with a discussion of the asset allocation benefits.  Because if you think about it, when you make a growth allocation, the first thing you do is you make an allocation to growth.  And then you can either implement that through ETFs and passive products, or you could engage an active manager instead.
So the first question is how did the asset allocation decision do with respect to adding growth stock exposures in portfolios?  And here, even after the selloff, the growth numbers look pretty good.  We compare a growth allocation using either the Russell 1000 Growth or the NASDAQ compared to the S&P Regular Index, value stocks, Europe, US, and global small cap stocks, and emerging markets.  And so if you look back three, four years, whatever kind of starting point you want to use, even with the selloff that took place over the last couple of quarters, growth stocks are still substantially ahead of those other asset allocation options.  So from an asset allocation perspective, growth delivered.
Now it’s careful, it’s important to take a closer look at this, ‘cause when you look at the Russell 1000 Index as an example, growth outperformed.  But a lot of that was due to the four largest stocks, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google.  As a matter of fact, almost half of the excess returns of growth over value from 2017 to the end of February of this year was simply due to the outperformance of those four largest stocks.  And that’s going to become an important issue when we start to talk about the performance of equity mutual funds and hedge funds, because a lot of active managers simply did not decide to hold market weight exposures in those four stocks.  So to summarize so far, the asset allocation decision to growth added value in portfolios even after the selloff.
So now let’s take a look at growth equity mutual funds.  And the short answer here is that outperformance has been scarce since any attempt at diversification ended up hurting your returns.  So we used Morningstar to get a universe of large cap growth mutual funds.  We narrowed it down to funds that have performance over the timeframe we’re looking at.  We used the lowest fee share class as a proxy for the institutional share class.
And then we start by looking at the growth managers that use the Russell 1000 Growth Index as their benchmark.  And only the top quartile managers ended up outperforming.  And I think the big issue here is that many managers may have been reluctant to hold index weight positions in those four large stocks.  And I would go further than the word reluctant.  A lot of them may have been discouraged from doing so for regulatory reasons.  There is something called the diversification rule in the Investment Company Act.  And in order to pass that diversification test, you really can’t own positions, any position over 5% has to sum to less than 25% of the fund.  And at the end of March for example, the Russell 1000 Growth Index had 36% in Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Google.  And so you would have failed that diversification test just by holding a market weight position in those stocks.
Now you don’t have to pass that diversification test, but there are a lot of client types, defined contribution plans is one example, that generally prefer and require funds that pass those diversification tests, which is why most equity mutual fund managers seek to pass that test.  And we estimate that over the timeframe we’re looking at, there was about a 15% cumulative performance drag in any portfolio that simply adhered to that diversification test by not wanting to exceed 25% of an individual mutual fund in those four stocks.  And that I think accounts for part, not all of, but a big part of the underperformance of equity mutual funds that are benchmarked against the Russell 1000 Growth Index.
There’s also a bunch of mutual funds that Morningstar categorizes as growth based on their actual positions but that use the S&P Core Index as their benchmark.  The bulk of these funds outperformed.  Now whether you as an investor should give managers with a really strong growth tilt credit for outperforming a core benchmark is up to you; I’m not sure that I would.
Now the question of hedge fund performance, there’s a lot of heavy lifting and assumptions required.  Measuring the performance of the industry in terms of long-only equity and fixed income mutual funds is pretty easy.  They all have stated benchmarks, and you can use Lipper and Morningstar to figure out how a bunch of managers did.
Private equity and venture capital, as we’ve written every two, three years in our deep dive on private equity and venture performance, performance measurements got a lot better because limited partners provide data to Burgess, which is a performance aggregator that allows for all sorts of time-weighted performance measurements versus a bunch of different public equity market benchmarks.  And you don’t have to worry about survivorship bias or selective reporting, because it’s the LPs providing the information.  And that kind of information was the basis of the piece that we wrote last year on private equity and venture.
Unfortunately, there is no such equivalent for the hedge fund industry.  And even before you get into the question of performance, you have to decide on what benchmark you’d use in the first place.  Suppose you had a hedge fund that returned 11%.  The question over some period, the question of whether or not that was really good or really bad or just moderate is actually one of the more complicated questions that I’ve dealt with in my whole history in investments.
In the 1990s, people used LIBOR plus a spread as a benchmark for hedge funds.  Then people compared them to other hedge fund managers in the HFRI Index.  People don’t use that as much now because of reporting issues and what managers choose to provide performance to HFR.  Sometimes we’ll use a benchmark that’s 60% equity, 40% fixed income under the notion that well, if you’re investing in hedge funds, you’re probably taking money out of both equities and fixed income in amounts that reflect the volatility of the hedge funds.
But when we’re doing the kind of analysis we do this time, we’re going to use an even simpler approach, which is over the long run, many long short hedge funds have a market beta of .45 versus the equity markets.  In other words, their returns rise and fall at around 45% of the rate of the market itself.
So in this analysis, we just took the Russell 1000 Growth Index, and we multiplied it by .45, whether it goes up or down, and we’re using that as a benchmark for long short hedge funds in the analysis.  And we’ve got some data here showing that that’s generally, a range of 40 to 50% is generally where those market betas have been over the last few years.
So getting back to this question of where do we even get hedge fund performance, we end up having to triangulate and use a bunch of different self-reported universes of hedge fund monthly returns.  Again, these databases are only as good as the managers that elect to provide information and the managers that do so consistently.  Because if you’re missing a bunch of months, it doesn’t do you any good, the whole thing, you can’t use any return information for that manager.  We use a database called PivotalPath.  We take another look at HFR data.  There’s another database we used called eVestment.  And so we a lot of triangulation in this piece to see how hedge fund performance turned out.  We also take a close look at the Tiger Cubs because the amount of assets they manage as generalist hedge funds.
And of course, lots of issues come up.  Different managers have different levels of growth and net leverage.  Some managers may have private exposures that are as high as 50% of the funds in AV [phonetic].  So that when public equity markets decline, some of those managers’ returns are not reflecting the likely eventual repricing of a lot of those private positions.  And so sometimes you have to wait a really long time before those kind of managers are publishing the kind of returns that really reflective of the risks in the portfolios.
Anyway, there’s a bunch of charts and tables here that go through the gory details of how we triangulated hedge fund performance.  The bottom line is that only the top quartile managers outperformed our benchmark, which was 45% of the Russell 1000 Growth Index.  And whether we looked at technology or generalist hedge funds, healthcare, or other categories, the results were pretty consistent.  The top quartile managers did pretty well.  The median managers tracked the benchmark, and the 25
th
percentile hedge fund manager trailed the benchmark.  The exception in many cases again were the Tiger Cub funds where even the best, even the top quartile Tiger Cub funds simply tracked the market, and the median Tiger Cub fund tend to trail the market.
Anyway, you can take a look at all of the information in this month’s piece.  And I thought it was an interesting time to look at this.  I don’t know that the growth selloff is completely finished yet.  I don’t think that we’re going to have a recession in the US this year.  There are certainly plenty of indicators that suggest there’s going to be a recession, the inverted yield curve, a collapse in consumer sentiment to one of the lowest levels in seven years, in inversion in ISM business survey orders falling below inventory levels, et cetera, et cetera.
But the labor markets are very tight, and there’s never been a recession without a pretty big spike in jobless claims.  And household and corporate balance sheets are in very, very good shape.  So I just don’t think that a recession is in the cards in the US for this year.  Looking out to the end of 2023/early 2024 to me is when the recession risks look a bit higher.
In any case, take a look at the piece.  For investors that have been participating in the growth trade, I think this is a helpful piece to try to think about where value was added and where it wasn’t by separating the asset allocation and the manager decisions in the process.  Thank you very much for listening.  The next Eye on the Market in all likelihood in May will be our 13
th
annual energy paper.  So I look forward to talking to you all at that time.  Have a great day, bye.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.The shift in market dynamics over the past year has caused investors to take a fresh look at their portfolios and examine new market opportunities. After the downturn, parts of the equity markets are presenting attractive entry points, while bonds are offering some of the most attractive yields we’ve seen in years.
Keeping too much cash on hand during times like these could stunt the growth of your portfolio. At the same time, liquidating investments to meet an unexpected or one-time expense could also take an unfortunate toll on your investment plan.
It’s why many investors choose to access credit to meet their liquidity needs, or for timely opportunities, while leaving their portfolios intact—even in a relatively higher interest rate environment. We’ve seen clients tap into lines of credit to:
Purchase real estate for cash in a competitive market and then put permanent financing in place down the road
Bridge a liquidity gap when they need funds immediately and expect cash flow from a bonus or sale of a business in the near future
Respond to time-sensitive market and business opportunities
In this article, we will explore how and when borrowing may still make sense to help investors reach their goals, even when rates are rising.
Borrowing to invest
Sophisticated investors often find investment opportunities when liquidity might not be readily available. Having a portfolio line of credit allows them to act quickly on those opportunities while remaining invested for the long term. Our research consistently finds that, historically, one of the most effective ways to compound wealth has been to stay invested through economic and market cycles.Also, borrowing to invest may help U.S. taxpayers enjoy an important tax benefit: Interest on loans used for investment purposes can be deductible. Although taxes should never drive investment decisions, it is wise to keep in mind that investing tax-efficiently can save money—which may be particularly helpful in an environment of more modest equity returns.
How a portfolio line of credit works
Portfolio lines of credit can be particularly attractive because they typically offer competitive rates and have a streamlined approval process, due to the surety of the assets pledged.  Borrowers pledge securities in an account and are free to trade in that account so long as they maintain the collateral levels to support the line of credit.
Borrowers are usually charged a variable Secure Overnight Financing Rate. Repayment terms are flexible, with interest paid only on the amount borrowed.
Of course, borrowing against securities has its risks. Among them: market fluctuations may cause the value of the assets to decline, which could trigger a need for additional collateral or liquidation of securities.
Looking at your big picture
Having a flexible liquidity plan in place can be a strategic complement to your investment portfolio to help meet your financial goals—your J.P. Morgan team is available to help you evaluate your options.
To get started, you may want to:
Identify your goals for the next 6-12 months
Evaluate all your borrowing options
Inventory your liabilities in light of low – but soon-to-be-rising – interest rates now available
Lines of credit are extended at the discretion of J.P. Morgan, and J.P. Morgan has no commitment to extend a line of credit or make loans available under the line of credit.
We’re here to help
Stay invested even through volatile market cycles to take advantage of opportunities. A portfolio line of credit can be a flexible and cost-effective way to access liquidity strategically and keep your investment plan intact. Reach out to your J.P. Morgan team to discuss your line and how it might help you pursue your goals.The chart highlights how investing for the long term in a well-diversified portfolio can result in a better retirement outcome.

JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon stated last week that he expects a “hurricane” resulting from the end of the largest fiscal and monetary experiment in history, and from the ongoing impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on food and energy prices. There are four brief points I’d like to make given the number of questions I have received.
[1] Jamie is one of the most candid and straight-talking CEOs I have seen in my lifetime, particularly in financial services (1980’s JP Morgan CEO Lew Preston who many of us worked for was close). Whether it’s the economy, regulatory costs and benefits, inner city development and job training, tax-funded infrastructure and education programs, energy myths and realities, voting rights, incarceration and “second-chance” hiring or other topics addressed in the annual shareholder letter, Jamie takes a clear stand. You may not always agree with him, but I wish more CEOs would do the same instead of seeking to avoid controversy and candor at every turn. As the CEO of the largest bank in the free world, he has a very informed view of the global economy and I’m always interested in what he has to say about it.
[2] Jamie’s
hurricane comments
(as I interpret them) are primarily focused on the view that currently elevated US employment, consumption and wages will not survive the unwinding of the Fed’s ill-advised negative rate experiment, the withdrawal of fiscal stimulus and rising food/energy costs. I agree with him. However, there’s an important timing issue for institutional and individual investors to consider. In every business cycle downturn, equity markets lead the economy by several months if not longer. In other words, equity markets anticipate the kind of economic hurricanes that Jamie expects. See the charts below on six major post-war business cycle downturns. In each one, equity markets declined, the economic hurricane worsened a few months later and
equity markets bottomed while the economy was still getting worse
. That’s what appears to be happening this time as well, at least so far.So far, US equity benchmarks (large cap, small cap, growth) are down 20%-30% from peak levels and the US has experienced just one quarter of negative GDP growth. Under the hood, equity markets have sustained more damage than that as we discuss next, since economic risks became more apparent after the surge in inflation and other aftershocks of Russia’s invasion in February.
[3]
Any investors taken aback by Jamie’s hurricane remark must not be paying attention: a lot of hurricanes have
already
hit equity markets
. The
average
stock in the NASDAQ, Russell 1000 Growth Index and the Russell 2000 Small Cap Index is down 40%-50% from peak levels
1
, with many down much more than that.  The fever dreams of many investors have already been completely decimated.  As such, I have prepared the following eulogy for some growth stocks, many of which are the YUCs (young unprofitable companies) that I’ve been writing about for the last few years.  All figures represent declines from peak levels unless otherwise noted.
“Dearly beloved...
We have gathered here today to mark the brief life and precipitous demise of many growth stocks. Having slipped the surly bonds of Earth just last year, they have now come asunder. Let us pray:
hydrogen and other renewable energy companies (-40%)
millennial oriented companies like SNAP which traded at 40x sales last year and which now trade at 5x sales
2
pandemic specials like Peloton which traded at 20x sales last year, and trade at 1x sales now
Chinese internet stocks (-70%) whose decline now matches the NASDAQ decline from 2000 to 2002
SPAC IPOs, an ecosystem of adversely selected generally unprofitable stragglers
3
whose average post-merger performance trails the Russell 2000 by 35%, an index which has declined by 30% from peak levels
the brave new world assessments of the ARK innovation ETF (-70%)
the “pop culture disruption” VPOP ETF (-60%) and the “meme stock” ETF (-65%), both of whose names tempted fate and released the furies
biotech and genomics (-55%) which now trade at the lowest valuation relative to projected return on equity of all industries we monitor
and of course, crypto and its associated flotsam and jetsam (crypto prices -65%, crypto miners -60%, crypto lenders -65% and crypto broker-dealers -80%)
Having fallen far short of everlasting life, may their souls rest in peace.”[4]
Despite these stock price declines, I do not believe that equity markets have yet hit bottom for this cycle
.  That was the theme of our webcast last week: I expect another leg down in equity markets, possibly this summer, as ramifications of monetary and fiscal policy withdrawal become clearer and as corporate earnings and capital spending decline.  We are witnessing the first hint of stagflation since the 1970’s, which is not yet priced in: almost two-thirds of the NASDAQ by market cap still trades with a price to sales above 4x.  The biggest economic tension as things stand now: there are signs that core inflation may be cooling a little bit (e.g., Cleveland and Dallas monthly PCE measures), but tight supplies in oil and gas markets are one or two pieces of bad news away from another spike that would increase inflation and recession risks further.
The challenge:
selling now after the equity declines that have already taken place with the goal of buying back at lower levels might require close to perfect timing and a lot of market depth which might not be there at the time
.  Generally, after eulogies like the one above are delivered, we’re closer to the end of the market decline than the beginning.  And as shown on the prior page, once a market bottom is made, there’s rarely another significant partial selloff.  In any case, we will continue to monitor the PMI and other leading indicators which have been the best signals for investors to follow in prior cycles.  See the webcast replay for more details.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Suddenly, yield for liquid investments has increased—and it may help soften inflation’s bite.Elyse Ausenbaugh, Global Investment Strategist
Adam Kuerbitz, Fixed Income Specialist
A year ago, it didn’t matter much where you held your cash. Whether in a simple deposit account or money market fund, cash earned only minimal basis points.
Little wonder, then, that many people were keeping large amounts of cash in their deposit accounts.
But now, interest rates have risen. So where you allocate cash is starting to matter—a lot. And the ability to achieve a higher yield on liquid investments is especially important in today’s inflationary environment.
To help offset the erosion of purchasing power caused by inflation, it’s time to get strategic about how one might stay liquid while also potentially earning a higher yield today.
Here, we look at potential places where cash could be put to work, ranging from bank-insured savings to investment products. As a reminder, investment products are not FDIC insured, have no bank guarantee and may lose value and involve risks.
*
Finding yield
These potential options depend on each individual’s needs, risk tolerance and timeline.
Banking options for individuals who:
1. Want to be extremely conservative
—Consider funding a CD
1
(i.e., a certificate of deposit account). Those who are comfortable leaving a sum untouched for an amount of time (typically for three months, six, nine or 12). For this concession, it may result in a higher yield than with a standard deposit account. These funds are also secured by the U.S. government, which are insured up to $250,000 in any single deposit account by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).
Investing options for individuals who:
2. Need daily liquidity
—If willing to assume a relatively low level of risk in exchange for what are typically slightly higher returns, consider money market funds
2
, the yields on which have increased significantly since January 2022. Money market funds enable regular withdrawal money, but the funds kept in the account are actually invested in the market. Market funds are not federally insured, so there is possibility of loss. However, they generally invest in low-risk, high-quality, short-term debt securities and are very highly regulated.
Among money market funds, the one with the least risk but lowest yield invests in short-term Treasury securities.
Next in terms of both risk and yield would be prime money market funds, which invest in commercial paper issued by banks and corporations.
And the third type are tax-aware market funds that invest in municipalities’ debt and offer yield with potential tax advantages. For people in the highest tax brackets, municipal money market funds may be a viable option.
3. Can tie cash up for nine or more months
—Individuals who can take more risk for the potential of more reward can invest in a mutual fund
3
that makes slightly longer-duration investments than a money market fund.
Some mutual funds also invest in corporate securities and are taxable. Others invest in municipal bonds (“munis”), the debt securities offered by a state, country or municipality to fund their capital expenditures. Muni funds’ yields can offer tax advantages.
4. Are able to set aside cash for 12 to 24 months
—Individuals may want to choose separately managed accounts (SMAs)
4
. With these accounts, investors directly own a collection of assets, including underlying assets like Treasuries, munis or corporate bonds.
Cash: The bottom line
In uncertain times, it’s natural for many people to hold on to more cash than they need. But when inflation hits and rates rise, that strategy can be counterproductive. To create a back-up plan, certain investors may establish a Portfolio Line of Credit (PLC)
5
. They may never need to use the PLC, but if they ever need or want to make large purchases or pay unexpected large expenses, they can access the necessary funds through their PLC—without having to keep large cash reserves idle or sell the carefully selected assets in their portfolios.
While we’ve offered some ideas that are intended to be educational, and should not be relied upon in isolation to make a financial decision, your J.P. Morgan team can provide personalized guidance and help you create an approach that could make sense for you.

INVESTMENTS INVOLVE RISKS, INCLUDING POSSIBLE LOSS OF PRINCIPAL. Yields are indicative, subject to change and are not guaranteed.
Prior to making any investment or financial decisions, an investor should seek individualized advice from personal financial, legal, tax and other professionals that take into account all of the particular facts and circumstances of an investor's own situation.
Read “KEY RISKS” below.
Key Risks
1
Bank deposit accounts, such as checking, savings and bank lending, may be subject to approval. Deposit products and related services are offered by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Member FDIC.
Early withdrawal penalties apply. For more details on the terms and conditions that govern the Certificates of Deposit, please refer to the
Combined Terms and Conditions or the International General Terms for Accounts and Services Account Agreement
, as applicable (the “Terms”).

MONEY MARKET FUNDS:
You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although Stable NAV Funds seek to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so.
Because the share price of the Fund will fluctuate, when you sell your shares they may be worth more or less than what you originally paid for them. The Fund may impose a fee upon the sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the Fund’s liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors.
An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.
The Fund’s sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time.
Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives and risk as well as charges and expenses of the Fund before investing. The prospectus contains this and other information about the mutual fund. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.
Funds that invests primarily in bonds, are subject to interest rate risks. Bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise. For some investors, income may be subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax. Income from investments in municipal securities is exempt from federal income tax. The risk of a municipal obligation generally depends on the financial and credit status of the issuer. For some investors, income may be subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax. Capital gains, if any, are federally taxable. Income may be subject to state and local taxes.

MUTUAL FUNDS:
Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the mutual funds before investing. The prospectus contains this and other information about the mutual fund
and should be read carefully before investing.
Funds invested in bonds and other debt securities will change in value based on changes in interest rates. If rates rise, the value of these investments generally drops. Income from investments in municipal securities is exempt from federal income tax. The risk of a municipal obligation generally depends on the financial and credit status of the issuer. For some investors, income may be subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax. Capital gains, if any, are federally taxable. Income may be subject to state and local taxes.

SEPARATELY MANAGED ACCOUNTS
(SMA’s): An SMA is a portfolio of securities managed on a client’s behalf by a portfolio manager for a fee. The portfolio manager has discretion to implement the portfolio per the stated investment objectives of the SMA.
SMA’s are subject to market risks. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that when an account is liquidated, it may be worth more or less than the original value. There can be no guarantee the objectives will be met.
SMA’s that invests primarily in bonds, are subject to interest rate risks. Bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise. For some investors, income may be subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax. Capital gains, if any, are federally taxable. Income may be subject to state and local taxes.

Summary: The slowdown induced by central bank tightening is just starting. Be patient when adding risk to portfolios. Valuations have declined materially but the price paid for high earnings growth is still elevated.
A bottom for equities is likely to coincide with a peak in inflation, since that will signify how much central banks have to tighten. A lot of Wall Street research claims that inflation is peaking now, and a recent IMF report came to similar conclusions
1
. As per the first chart, the IMF sees US inflation peaking around current levels.
Even so, I don’t think we’re there yet
. Inflation has already blown past the IMF forecast for Europe, and as shown below, there’s evidence of a wage-price spiral in the US in low wage industries
2
; US labor markets are still at their tightest levels in the post-war era; and supply chain pressures which spiked last year have yet to abate (some of which is due to the China lockdowns). On top of all that, rising food and energy prices are now feeding into airlines, restaurant and lodging prices
3
.
Bottom line
: there’s a lot riding on when inflation peaks. Even if that happens now (which I doubt), the Fed has a ways to go before it can stop tightening.Inflation, central banks and P/E multiples
. As shown in the next chart, when real Treasury yields went negative in 2020 (i.e., Treasury rates fell below inflation), that’s when P/E multiples shot up over 20x. Now that real yields are moving into positive territory again, P/E multiples are declining. And the more positive real yields become, the more equity multiples are likely to fall. That’s why I am less focused on earnings right now; this correction (so far) is all about overpriced multiples finally coming down.
The market barometers on the following page show how valuations have declined. Before we get into that, see the second chart: while the premium investors pay for growth has come down a lot, it’s still high vs history.
The barometers tell a similar story: the COVID stimulus boost to valuations has now been unwound, but for the most part, investors are still paying a large premium for companies with high expected earnings growth, at least relative to history.
US equity markets are also not pricing in a recession yet: according to Goldman Sachs, S&P 500 pricing for cyclicals vs defensives implies an ISM reading of 49 and GDP growth of 0%-1%.
Economic growth is likely to fall as central banks tighten. Leading indicators point to a decline in manufacturing activity this fall (third chart), and the lean inventory positions of a year ago are gone
. As shown in the last chart, rising inventory levels in the US have now converged with falling sales. Large declines in manufacturing and bloated inventory conditions usually result in large earnings declines. For anyone looking to add risk to portfolios this year, more bad news is now in the price for equities (the S&P selloff of 18% from its peak is ~70% of the average selloff during the prior 11 recessions), but still I think you can be patient.Bear market barometers: equities
This cycle is reminiscent of 2001 and 1987: extended valuations finally coming back down to earth alongside what might be a shallow recession.  It’s quite different than 2008 and 1991 when the primary issues were banking sector solvency, overleveraged households and a housing crash.  That’s why most of the damage is seen in equities rather than in credit spreads.Bear market barometers: fixed incomeA COVID apology
COVID vaccines continue to yield massive public health benefits. Data from multiple states show a large gap between vaccinated and unvaccinated hospitalizations and deaths during the Omicron variant surge last winter
4
. These benefits are critical now that Omicron variants are becoming more transmissible, more resistant to monoclonal antibodies and more prone to “immunity escape” (i.e., lower cross-immunity for unvaccinated people who had BA.1)
5
. Still, some people do not believe that vaccines work based on theories which have been described by my science advisory group as unsubstantiated and false (and those are their kinder words).
That said, I have an apology to make. On two occasions this year in the Eye on the Market, I disparagingly mentioned how someone I’ve known for 20 years has differing views on COVID vaccines based on research he published and some personal correspondence we had.
I was wrong to do that
; I described his views rather than pointing people to where they could read them for themselves; I did not allow him to articulate his point of view in these pages in a point-counterpoint discussion; and I did not acknowledge that his primary focus was not epidemiology but the impact on markets if the vaccines are as ineffective as he believes they are.
As things stand now, each of us believes that the other is hopelessly lost in a sea of disinformation. I am still not sure how to deal with that, but preserving the relationship has turned out to be more important to me than rupturing it over our inability to see things the same way. As shown in the bar chart, COVID has done this to a lot of people: lost tempers, damaged relationships and a lot of stress. So, no more judgments from me; just the data and the latest research on our portal which everyone can interpret for themselves.Crypto update since our “
Maltese Falcoin
” piece: Fortune may not favor the brave after allCrypto valuation theories
“Store of Value” argument continues to disintegrate given Bitcoin volatility that is 5x the S&P 500, and its 0.8 correlation with the NASDAQ
“Crypto as an inflation hedge” repudiated as crypto prices plummet while inflation rises
Bitcoin as a means of exchange? Not yet; confirmed transactions per day still below 2018-2020 levels
DeFi lending use case also crumbling as expected: since most DeFi lending is collateralized by crypto, DeFi lending activity has declined 25% YTD along with declining crypto prices
Gaming tokens financed by venture capitalists plummet as Metaverse user base falls short of expectations. Decentraland, Axie Infinity and Sandbox tokens have higher valuations and fewer users than non-blockchain games like Fortnite, Candy Crush, etc. Sandbox and Decentraland average daily users were around 1,000 people in late April. I think that’s the number of people still using Lotus 1-2-3
Some crypto collapses can be linked to unsustainably high “staking” yields paid to crypto holders that eventually reset closer to prevailing short term interest rates
Growing list of developing countries with full or partial bans on crypto as a means of payment
Coinbase claimed to have 3 million users on its NFT waitlist but since launch has yet to see more than 200 NFT transactions on any given day
Increase in daily verified Ethereum contracts per day since February report (i.e., a scarce positive)
Stablecoins Tether and USDC continue to trade close to par. As explained in our piece, stablecoin valuations have little relevance for directional crypto prices when they are collateralized by liquid reserves. The adoption of blockchain applications using stablecoins also has no relevance for directional crypto prices. On Tether, the company has reportedly disclosed it holds $40 billion in government bonds and cash out of its $79 billion in total reserves; the rest of its reserve composition is a mix of commercial paper, CDs, money market funds, loans, corporate bonds, precious metals and other digital tokens
Regulatory
Terra’s CEO reportedly founded another stablecoin called Basis Cash (using a pseudonym from the animated
Rick & Morty
show) which failed when it lost its peg in 2021 and
is now trading at 1 cent on the dollar
. Some believe that the Terra collapse resulted from a coordinated attack or manipulation, which I find strange since “pump and dump” schemes and other activities that would be prohibited in regular securities markets are by definition not illegal on decentralized blockchains
Cryptocurrency investors are not paying the IRS
at least half of the taxes they owe on their virtual-currency trades according to Barclays. The IRS has begun to crack down on tax evasion among crypto investors and in 2023 will begin requiring brokers to report transactions worth at least $10,000

wage-price spiral chart
is meant to indicate that companies that hire a lot of lower wage workers are paying large wage increases which they are passing along to customers. On inflation, we show the equal-weighted wage growth in industries such as restaurants, hotels, casinos, nursing homes, child care, hair salons and laundry services. For wages, we show average hourly earnings for leisure and retail. For more information, see

MR. MICHAEL CEMBALEST: Good morning, welcome to another Eye on the Market podcast. This one is for our Bear Market Barometers piece. We’ve done two podcasts so far on the energy piece. I’ll have a couple more on residential heating and hydrogen coming up in the weeks ahead. But I wanted to make sure and do a quick podcast on this week’s piece.
The bottom line is the slowdown that will eventually be induced by the central banks raising policy rates is just starting. And I think you can be patient when adding risk to portfolios. A good amount of damage has been done in terms of lower multiples in a bunch of different markets, but earnings are going to eventually come down, and markets are pricing in maybe a 30 to 40% chance of a recession. And if you’re looking for a bottom at which to add risk, you’d normally want to do that when the chance of a recession is priced in at least 50 or 60%. That bottom is likely to coincide with a peak in inflation, because that’s going to tell us how much the central banks are going to have to tighten. A lot of Wall Street research and the IMF thinks that’s happening now. They think the peak in inflation is happening now, but I don’t think we’re there yet.
We’ve got a couple of charts in this piece. The US labor markets are at their tightest levels in the post-war era. The supply chain pressures, which are still pretty intense, have yet to come down. And most importantly, there’s evidence at least in part of the US economy, specifically in low-wage industries, that there’s a wage price spiral going on. In other words, wages are going up, companies are passing along those price increases to customers, and that wage price spiral is kicking in in ways we haven’t seen it in at least 30 years, maybe 40. So there’s a lot riding on when inflation peaks. But even if that happens now, which I doubt the Fed has got a ways to go before it can stop raising policy rates. And I think along the way, there may be some better entry points in equity markets even than the ones that we see right now.
There’s a chart in here. Sometimes, we talked about this a lot over the years, and we all knew, you knew that this was going to change one day. The only question is when. And what I’m referring to is negative policy rates, in other words, policy rates and ten-year Treasuries below the rate of inflation. And we had never lived through, I had never lived through a period where we had such sustained low policy rates. And then in 2020, the ten-year went deeply negative in real terms, and that’s when PE multiples really took off and rose.
And now that Treasury rates are on their way towards rising above the rate of inflation, or at least inflation expectations, PE multiples are declining. So I think that process has more to go. And I’m so focused on earnings right now. This correction so far is mostly about overpriced multiples finally coming down, which is why we have a couple of pages showing you what’s happened to PE multiples in a number of different markets.
Before I get into that, I just want to mention that there is a chart in here that looks at two different ways of the value versus growth question. No matter how you look at it, markets are not “back to normal” yet. We’re nowhere near where we were from let’s say 2010 to 2018, where there was some kind of stable equilibrium between value and growth. Growth stocks, even though they’ve come down a bunch on an earnings yield basis, are still pretty expensive. And some of the leading indicators that we looked at tell us that there’s likely to be a pretty sharp drawdown in global manufacturing sometime this fall. And usually when global manufacturing takes a dive down, global corporate earnings do as well.
And the cushion that we had last year in the US was that inventory levels are very low. Well now they’ve caught up, and one of the charts in here shows you that inventories have actually risen quite sharply and that sales have come down to that level of inventory. So some of the cushions that we had in terms of an understocked and undersupplied corporate sector that existed last year are not in place right now.
There’s a page in here that has PE multiples for equities, just some charts and monitors that we’re following. And what you’ll see is certainly amongst the growth stocks and amongst the big mega-cap eight stocks, the largest eight by market cap, the surge in valuations that took place because of COVID stimulus, that’s been completely reversed. So if you’re looking for an entry point that has to do with erasing the premium that was put on these stocks because of all the stimulus from COVID, that’s now been erased and eliminated. But that still puts you at 2018/2019 multiples, which are on the expensive side of history.
What looks a little bit cheaper here is US small cap and Europe, but I don’t have a ton of confidence in either one of those right now as a bottom fishing expedition. The NASDAQ looks tempting. Half of the NASDAQ is down at least 50%, but in the correction that took place in 2001, it was much worse than that. And so it still feels like there could be a little bit to come as well in terms of NASDAQ weakness.
And then there’s a page on fixed income, which is a mixed bag. The opportunities in emerging markets government bonds have gotten pretty attractive, whereas US high yield has only just begun to widen. And there really hasn’t been much activity at all in terms of investment-grade credit spreads, leveraged loans, commercial paper, and asset-backed securities. And I think that makes sense because this to me, this feels more like 2001 than 2008. In other words, this is a multiple and valuation story, and this is not a story about credit risk or the security and safety of the banking system. So I think that’s a pretty important distinction. So bottom line, there should be some cheaper entry points over the next few months because the Fed still has a lot of work to do to catch up to the wage and price inflation that’s percolating in the system.
There’s a couple of follow-ups here. I have some information on COVID, including an apology from me to somebody. You can read about why I’m doing that. And then there’s a chart in here called Tails from the Crypt. I thought it would be interesting to look at an update on what’s gone on in the crypto markets since our Maltese Falcon piece last February. Look, I mean when I wrote this paper, I got a lot of grief for it as an old guy, I’m turning 60 this week, who doesn’t understand the future. All I can tell you is that since I wrote that piece, the value proposition and valuation theories for crypto, in my opinion, just keep getting worse and worse and worse. I’ll tick through a few of them. The concept of a store of value for Bitcoin, I mean, Bitcoin’s volatility remains five times the volatility of the S&P 500. It’s got a 0.8 correlation with the NASDAQ. Crypto as an inflation hedge doesn’t make sense. Crypto prices are plummeting while inflation is going up. Bitcoin, its number of confirmed transactions per day is still below where it was in 2018. So Bitcoin as a means of exchange isn’t going anywhere.
For Ethereum and the kind of blockchain application-based tokens and exchanges platforms, as we expected, DeFi lending is crumbling, because most DeFi lending is collateralized by crypto, and DeFi lending is down 25% along with declining crypto prices. This wasn’t very difficult to anticipate.
And then the gaming tokens, a lot of very smart venture capital people put a ton of money into some of these metaverse gaming things. Decentraland, Axie Infinity, Sandbox, they all have very high valuations and fewer users than the non-blockchain games like Fortnight and Candy Crush and Grand Theft Auto. I read a report that at the end of April, Sandbox and Decentraland were averaging around 1,000 users a day. I mean, I think that’s still the number of people that use Lotus 1-2-3. So as far as I can tell, the value proposition and the valuation theories for crypto have gotten worse rather than better since our February piece. So that’s it for this week. I will be back next week with a part three podcast on our energy paper. Thank you for listening.

The last two Eye on the Market pieces covered our views on the sequence of events around recessions: markets decline, then earnings, then GDP and finally employment. Also, the worst mistakes of this cycle (YUCs – young unprofitable companies, SPACs, renewable energy with limited commercialization potential, Fintech dependent on regulatory arbitrage and/or catering to the lowest quality borrowers, Metaverse, crypto, etc) have all been repriced, which is positive in terms of where we go from here. I envision one last leg down later this summer, since the Fed has more work to do on the inflationary aftershocks of the most stimulative policy in 150 years.
Most summer reading lists are carefully curated, inspirational, guaranteed not-to-offend elegies to the human spirit. This is not that
. See below for materials to inform your discussions on energy, economics, finance, the Supreme Court, geopolitics, China and COVID/cancer research as this long hot summer rolls on. We conclude with the recently unearthed “
Shakespeare’s Annotated Guide to Bitcoin
”.
ENERGY
Vaclav’s 47
th
book, “
How the World Really Works
”, is an interdisciplinary and comprehensive look at food, energy, data, globalization, viruses and the main pillars of the modern world. Required reading for the legions of futurists trying to redesign the world we live in. Having Vaclav as an energy mentor for the last decade has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my career.

“The Elephants in the Room”.
Our 12th annual energy piece starts with the energy crisis in Europe, the recovery in the oil & gas sector and a warning label on industrial electrification and carbon sequestration forecasts. We examine electric vehicle adoption, the transmission quagmire, bans on combustion of fossil fuels for heating in favor of electric heat pumps and a deep and skeptical dive on the hydrogen economy.

“
Squaring venture capital valuations with reality
”. Researchers from Stanford found that unicorn valuations have been vastly overstated by an average ~50% (!!) over fair value. The primary reason: sloppy valuation methods which use the valuation ascribed to the latest round of capital, even if that round benefits from IPO return guarantees, liquidation preferences, vetoes over down-IPO rounds and/or seniority over other investors. The average unicorn has eight share classes; after valuing each class based on its specific terms and conditions, almost half the unicorns in this analysis lost their billion dollar unicorn status. This has implications for how unicorns are marked on the way up, and on the way down.

“The Chart that Everybody Hates”.
An update on an analysis we did a few years ago. The chart shows how entitlement spending is displacing discretionary spending on infrastructure, education, job retraining, energy and the judiciary that contribute to future growth, employment and intergenerational mobility. A forensic deep dive on what it would take to restore the prior balance between entitlements and discretionary spending, from the separate perspectives of fiscal progressives and fiscal conservatives. A real crowd-pleaser at parties.

“No free lunch”
. A piece I prepared for the bank’s Operating Committee. Bank capital adequacy and liquidity rules established after the financial crisis reduce insolvency risk for depositors and taxpayers, but come at a cost: a decline in market liquidity and greater execution risks in multi-trillion dollar US fixed income markets. Almost all measures of liquidity and market depth are close to the lowest levels on record. A growing risk as the largest stimulus program in history is withdrawn, requiring fixed income investors to fend for themselves.

Who says Shakespeare isn’t still relevant to the modern world
Here’s Shakespeare’s take on Bitcoin. Quote #5 was the inspiration for the title of our crypto/blockchain piece from earlier this year, the
Maltese Falcoin
. See footnote for comments on the imploding DeFi lending market
1
.1
One issue roiling crypto:
the collapsing DeFi lending market
. From our February piece: “What kind of lending is actually taking place here? From what we can tell, most DeFi lending is simply over-collateralized crypto loans to other holders of crypto so that the latter can either (a) buy more crypto, or (b) obtain liquidity against appreciated crypto holdings without incurring capital gains taxes. Either way, it does not appear to be the kind of lending that could survive a large sustained decline in crypto prices themselves”. As we anticipated last February, DeFi lending volumes have collapsed at almost the identical rate as Ethereum and other token prices.
It would be hard to overstate just how “house of cards” the DeFi lending market is.
DeFi lending failures so far include Celsius, Anchor Protocol, Babel Finance, BlockFi, Vauld and Voyager.

https://privatebank.jpmorgan.com/gl/en/insights/investing/eotm/independence-days,"Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.
Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Topics: A revised map of the United States; investing in equities before a recession; Russia’s natural gas squeeze on Europe leads to another rescue program for Italy; the high cost of pariah status for the oil refining industry
Independence Days
. Europe’s energy crisis, China’s commodity trade war with Australia and other examples of resource nationalism (India and Indonesia restrictions on exports of wheat, sugar and palm oil) all reinforce the following: reliance on food and energy imports creates supply, price, currency stability and national security risks. In the US, food and energy imports as a percentage of consumption are the lowest out of all manufactured goods categories, resulting in a degree of
food and energy independence
uncommon to other countries.
This prompted me to create a map of the United States in which
each state is sized based on its production of food, energy and minerals
. I used 2021 production values; had I used 2022 data, the results would be more amplified. The results: states in the Northeast, Southeast and Pacific Northwest shrink relative to mid-Western and mid-Atlantic states, and Texas. As the Biden administration evaluates options to reduce the highest US food and energy inflation in decades (overtures to Saudi Arabia and Venezuela for more oil; a ban on export of US refined products
1
; gas tax holiday; increase from 10% to 15% in summertime ethanol blends to boost gasoline supply but which has driven corn prices to all-time highs - see Appendix I and II), I think about this map a lot
2
.Energy includes crude oil, natural gas and coal, plus electricity generated by nuclear, solar, wind, hydro, geo-thermal and biomass
Non-fuel mining includes metallic metals (cobalt, copper, iron ore, REE, nickel, platinum, palladium, zinc), construction aggregates (gravel, crushed stone, construction sand) and other industrial minerals (gypsum, lithium, peat, potash etc)
Food includes gross receipts of farms (meat, dairy, poultry, fruits, vegetables, food/feed crops)The US is a “Republic” which ascribes electoral and legislative power to some states in this revised map that is in excess of their population shares
. Their critical contributions to food and energy independence are often underappreciated by an increasingly urbanized society (see below on the energy disaster now facing Germany), so I generally believe that a Republic ends up in the “right” place.
But I also know that it’s a difficult time to have that discussion. There are different kinds of independence; while US energy independence has finally been attained, other kinds of US independence are suddenly disappearing. They are outside the scope of this report; I will refer you instead to press articles on JP Morgan’s policies with respect to its employees and their reproductive rights and health
3
.In any case, food and energy inflation and independence also bring to mind another chart below. The unwinding of the largest stimulus program in history has resulted in a
repricing of “real world” vs “digital world” assets
, with the former comprised of equities linked to the food, energy and mining products used to build the US state map. The repricing of “digital world” stocks has resulted in more reasonable growth stock valuations for the first time in a while, and is part of the “investing before a recession” topic we discuss next.Digital world
: ride sharing, digital payments, cybersecurity, cloud computing, big data, social media, fintech, metaverse, food delivery, online shopping, wearable tech, peer-to-peer video, gaming, commission-free trading, video streaming and cryptoLessons learned on energy independence: Germany
Germany, aiming for 100% renewable power by 2035, is now pushing the G7 to rescind a commitment to halt financing of overseas fossil fuel projects. Instead, Germany wants the G7 to “
acknowledge that publicly supported investment in the gas sector is necessary as a temporary response to the current energy crisis
”. Why? For the first time since the war began, Russia is cutting gas supplies to Europe via the Nord Stream pipeline (see supporting chart below), leaving Germany with only 10 weeks of supply. The risks: damage to Germany’s industrial furnaces requiring 75% gas inputs, gas rationing to homes and businesses, an exodus of manufacturing jobs and a steeper recession. One vital choke point: the world’s largest integrated chemical complex run by BASF which sits at the beginning of many industrial supply chains, including ammonia for fertilizer. BASF Chief Executive Martin Brudermüller: “There is no short term solution to replace natural gas from Russia”.
A postscript
: Eastern Europe, long wary of relying on Russian gas and ridiculed as paranoid by Germany, is moving forward with plans to source nuclear technology from the US. These countries might have sourced it from Germany had the country not sold its nuclear technology assets to Russia’s Rosatom during the Merkel administration.
Sources: Bloomberg, Wall Street Journal, Foreign Policy Magazine, JPMAM.Investing in equities before a recession
I don’t know if there will be a recession in the US, but chances are rising so let’s assume there will be. In the last
Eye on the Market
,
we discussed how equity markets usually bottom before recessions and how equity markets were already rising by the time the recession was underway (see table below which summarizes the results). If that’s the case, investors need to be on the lookout for signals that are not as stale as employment and GDP. Historically, PMI surveys have been the best leading indicators. We expect these surveys to continue falling, but will be watching closely for turning points.
Another equity market signal: in past cycles, equity markets did not bottom until long term Treasury yields were declining, or at least until they stopped rising
. The first chart below shows 10 year Treasury yields; the vertical bars represent equity market bottoms. In the last three cycles, bond yields started falling well before the equity bottom. From 1950 to 1982 when rates were rising on a secular basis, Treasury rates hit their peak right at the equity bottom. So, while I’m not a technician, a sign that the PMI index has bottomed out and that Treasury yields have peaked would be a good sign for investors, even as economic data are still deteriorating.Meanwhile, market signals on investor capitulation are mixed.
As shown on the left, there has been a spike in the number of
companies trading below the value of cash on their balance sheets
. To be clear, companies that are destined for insolvency can trade below cash value for good reason (i.e., when the value of their non-cash assets are insufficient to repay liabilities). But as a measure of capitulation, this is a sign that investors have thrown in the towel on many of their ill-fated growth investments. In contrast, the chart on the right shows a survey of retail investor asset allocation preferences (which are still elevated) vs consumer sentiment (which has crashed). The growing gap between the two suggests that retail investors are still too optimistic.
I put more stock in the first chart (i.e., more capitulation) when combined with (a) data we discussed last time on how the average stock in the Russell 1000 Growth Index, the NASDAQ and the Russell 2000 Small Cap Index is down 40%-50% from peak levels, and (b) a sharp decline in hedge fund and risk parity fund leverage
4
.On a related note, I read an article in the
Atlantic
on the “end of the Millennial lifestyle subsidy”.
The article notes that millennials have effectively been subsidized by overly optimistic investors and that this subsidy is now ending. Let’s assume that a prototypical millennial wakes up in a Casper bed, exercises on a Peloton, takes an Uber to their WeWork office, spends time on Snap while waiting for DoorDash to bring an Impossible Meat burger for lunch and takes Lyft home for a Blue Apron dinner. In aggregate, these companies were supported by equity investors despite having aggregate $6 to $10 billion in annual free cash flow deficits since 2018
5
. Many of these companies will now have to be profitable to survive, which may involve higher prices to customers.Russia’s natural gas squeeze on Europe indirectly leads to another rescue program for Italy
Inflation pressures are rising in Europe, in part since Russian supplies of natural gas to Europe are being cut again. For the first time since the war began, Russia cut gas flows to Europe through the Nord Stream pipeline: NS1 flows are down by 60% as Russia claims the need for turbine maintenance. Producer and consumer prices are rising in Germany at the fastest rate since 1980, and markets expect European headline inflation to hit 9% later this year which is ~2% higher than current ECB forecasts. As a reminder, natural gas shortages affect both energy and food prices since natural gas accounts for 70%-90% of nitrogenous fertilizer costs. As the ECB raises policy rates and credit spreads widen, this creates problems for one the world’s most indebted countries: Italy.I haven’t written about Italy for a while. Its default risk declined in 2012 when the ECB partially socialized Italy’s debt problem among other members of the Eurozone. Given Italy’s high sovereign debt, it needs low rates: as Gavekal Research has highlighted, every time Italy’s government bond yields drift above its economic growth rate (left chart), its debt ratio has gone up (right chart). Now yields are rising and growth is falling in Italy, threatening another surge in government debt.
However, it looks like yet another ECB rescue program is on the way
. We expect an announcement in July; the ECB organized an emergency meeting when Italian 10 year yields hit 4% (~2.5% over Germany), which appears to be some kind of tolerance threshold. We expect the ECB to “sterilize” its purchases of Italian debt by soaking up money supply via European bank deposits, similar to the Fed’s repo program. As usual, the ECB hopes that the threat of intervention will be enough to drive Italian yields down without actually having to buy them. It should be obvious at this point that
Italy is a permanent financial ward of the Eurozone
, and that German savers who pay for this have effectively lost their economic independence.Appendix I: US refining capacity, gasoline prices and the high cost of pariah status
US refining capacity has been falling since COVID while US refined product consumption is back to pre-COVID levels
US gasoline refinery shutdowns have increased due to (a) high maintenance/repair costs, (b) declining institutional investor interest in oil & gas, (c) declining bank lending to oil & gas, (d) widespread opposition to refinery expansion and (e) conversion of refineries to biofuels instead [Marathon, Phillips 66 and HollyFrontier]. Refinery shutdowns are very costly and practically impossible to reverse
US refineries are operating at the upper end of historical capacity utilization
Russia is the 2
nd
largest refined products exporter after the US, so sanctions affect global prices for refined products
If US refining capacity continues to decline, options for eventually importing refined products are unfavorableAppendix II: energy/food independence and food price inflation
The US has finally reached independence in both food and energy. Europe is also a net food exporter, but is still a substantial energy importer
US farmers seeking to boost the food supply requested that the USDA relax rules related to the Conservation Reserve Program that pays them to keep land idle. So far, the USDA has only made minor adjustments, allowing farmers with CRP contracts expiring in 2022 to start planting now
US corn prices are rising due to (a) an increase in US ethanol blends over the 2022 summer driving season, (b) the impact of rising natural gas prices on nitrogenous fertilizer costs and (c) a 25% decline in Russian fertilizer exports (Russia usually accounts for 15%-20% of global fertilizer exports, see bar chart). US tariffs on imported fertilizer have not been reduced; instead the Administration announced a grant program designed to boost fertilizer production1
Export bans on refined products could lead, counterintuitively, to higher gasoline prices.
A refined products export ban could divert gasoline supplies to domestic markets rather than foreign ones. But given low diesel demand in the Northeast, refiners could also be stuck with excess diesel that they would have to store (i.e., an expense rather than revenues). If so, refiners might actually
cut
runs until overall refining profitability per barrel is restored. A temporary Jones Act suspension might be needed as well in order to avoid domestic shipping costs offsetting the benefits of increased gasoline supply. A better solution: an export ban on gasoline only, allowing diesel to still be exported. See JP Morgan Commodity Research, June 22, item #7.

In
a future world of much greater renewable energy, US energy independence would decline
: China is by far the largest producer of PV modules, wind turbines, lithium ion batteries, electric vehicle mineral processing and related cathode and anodes.

MR. MICHAEL CEMBALEST:  Good afternoon, everybody.  This is the late June Eye on the Market podcast.  This podcast accompanies the piece that we sent out this week called Independence Days.  It covers a bunch of topics in here related to energy independence, what’s going on in Europe and Russia, and the broader topic of investing in equities before recession with some metrics on where we are in the cycle.
So first on this Independence Day question, there is a lot of resource nationalism going on in the world, and what does that refer to?  China is having a commodity trade war with Australia.  Countries like India and Indonesia are putting restrictions on exports of wheat, sugar, and palm oil.  And then of course there’s all of the issues going on in Russia and Ukraine with respect to Russian decisions to halt exports of certain commodities and sanctions on the purchase of Russian commodity exports by other countries.
All of this reinforces something that a lot of people, myself included, have known for a long time, which is that relying on food and energy imports is a risky thing.  It creates supply risks, price risks, currency stability risks, and national security risks.  United States happens to be more food and energy-independent than most countries.  Food and energy imports as a percentage of consumption are the lowest out of all the manufactured goods categories.  In other words, the U.S. relies on imports as a greater percentage of consumption for most other things that get consumed.
So I wanted to visualize this, and so I created a revised map of the United States, in which each state is sized based on its production of food, energy, and minerals.  And the results were familiar but still interesting to look at.  The states in the Northeast, the Southeast, and the Pacific Northwest shrink relative to Midwestern states, Mid-Atlantic states, and Texas.
And I was looking and thinking about this map a lot as the
Biden administration struggles to figure out options to reduce the highest level of food and energy inflation in decades, including things like overtures to Saudi Arabia and Venezuela to pump more oil, a possible ban on the export of refined products, gas tax holiday, increasing summertime ethanol blends, which helps boost the gasoline supply, but drives corn prices to all-time highs, things like that.  And so you can see on the first page what this map looks like.  And it’s interesting to look at.
Now the concept of independence is a broad one.  The U.S., and this is mentioned a lot in Congress, the U.S. is a republic, which means that it ascribes electoral and legislative power to some states in this map that is well in excess of their share of the country’s population.  And in many cases, their critical contributions to food and energy independence are often overlooked and underappreciated by an increasingly urbanized society.  Around 85% of the people in the United States live in large cities.  And because some of these food and energy contributions are so critical and difficult to replicate through imports, I’ve always generally believed that a republic, whether intentionally or not, ends up in the right kind of “fair place” with respect to these contributions and the relative legislative and electoral power.  But I also know it’s a difficult time to have that discussion.
There’s different kinds of independence.  And while U.S. energy independence has finally been attained after 50 years of trying, other kinds of independence are suddenly disappearing.  They are outside the scope of what I can write about and should write about and I’m allowed to write about.  But I will refer you instead to some press articles in the piece on J.P. Morgan’s policies with respect to its employees and their reproductive rights and health.  And I will just say in my own personal view, I’m glad that the firm did what it did.
Getting back to the issues of the day on energy independence, take a look at what’s happening in Germany.  Germany is a country aiming for 100% renewable power by 2035 and is pushing the G7 nations to rescind and walk back a commitment to halt the financing of fossil fuel projects.  Instead, Germany wants the G7 to, and this is the quote from Germany, acknowledge that publicly supported investment in the gas sector is necessary as a temporary response to the current energy crisis.
Why is Germany, the architect of one of the most ambitious renewable transitions in the world, saying this?  Well they are learning an energy independence lesson, and it’s a painful one.  For the first time since the war began, Russia is cutting gas supplies to Europe via the Nord Stream pipeline and they’re cutting them by a lot.  And this is leaving Germany with only ten weeks of supplies.  And the risks to Germany are pretty substantial if these reductions are permanent.  A lot of Germany’s industrial furnaces essentially require 75% gas inputs, without which they crack and break.  Germany is facing the prospects of gas rationing to homes and businesses, an exodus of some of its hard-fought and hard-won manufacturing jobs, and a steeper recession.
So this question of energy independence is a critical one as we sta
rt thinking about Independence Day and the steps that different countries will need to take to become energy independent.  And this is something I’ve written a lot this entire year and the last few years, which is making sure that policies to reduce the supply of fossil fuels are properly calibrated relative to policies that reduce the demand for fossil fuels so that one does not outstrip the other.
In any case, this food and energy independence issue brings to mind some of the other work that we did this week.  The unwinding of the massive stimulus program ended up causing a repricing of real world assets versus digital world assets, where real world assets started finally going up, and those are assets linked to food, energy, and mining.  And the digital world assets have dropped sharply and obviously those are all the things you’re familiar with, whether it’s ride-sharing, digital payments, cloud computing, Fintech, food delivery, wearable tech peer-to-peer video gaming, all that stuff.  And that repricing in the digital world is pretty advanced and has resulted in more reasonable growth stock valuations for the first time in a very long time and as part of the whole investing before a recession topic that we get into as well in this week’s piece.
I don’t know if this is going to be a recession or not in the United States, but chances are rising, so let’s just assume there will be.  In the last Eye on the Market, we discussed how equity markets usually bottom before recessions and how equity markets are usually rising by the time the recession is really in full swing and starts to get better.  So if that’s the case, investors need to be on the lookout for certain signals that are not as stale as employment and GDP.  We discuss some of those leading indicators in this piece.  We’re closely watching the manufacturing PMI level of ten-year interest rates.
We have a chart in here showing the prior six cycles and how bond yields started falling before equities hit bottom.  But there’s a table that shows that if you wait until the economy has bottomed out or improving before you start investing again, the opportunity cost is pretty substantial, anywhere from 20 to 40% in the equity market that tends to rally during that timeframe.
And one of my favorite capitulation measures is this chart that we have in here that looks at the number of stocks that are trading underwater.  Now what does it mean for a stock to trade underwater?  It’s when the value of the company trades below the value of its cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet.  In other words, the cash on the balance sheet and short-term investments could be liquidated for more than the stock is trading at.
Now companies can still trade like that for a good reason if the value of their non-cash assets are not enough to repay their liabilities.  But as a capitulation measure, it’s pretty good.  And as we show in the chart here, the underwater stocks are now a higher percentage of the market that either in 2002 or in 2009.  And so to me, we’re gathering up a growing list of capitulation measures that that suggests that sometime this summer, maybe one more leg down the market will be a very interesting time to start putting money back to work.
We have an interesting section in here as well on the end of the millennial lifestyle subsidy and talks about how a bunch of millennial-oriented companies were essentially financed by the markets despite having 6, $8 billion annual free cash-flow deficits in aggregate, and how a lot of these companies will now have to be profitable to survive, which is going to end up with DoorDash, WeWork, Lyft, Blue Apron, Uber, Peloton, impossible, all these companies are going to be under a lot of pressure, which means both layoffs and higher prices to
consumers.
Let’s go back to energy for a second, because I want to talk about this rescue program for Italy.  So as I mentioned earlier, Russia has cut the Nord Stream pipeline flows to Europe by 60%, which is enormous.  Now Russia is claiming the need for turbine maintenance.  Most of the Europeans that are close to this don’t believe that.  Producer and consumer prices are rising in Germany now at the fastest rate since 1980, and headline inflation in Europe might hit 9% this year.
So as the ECB raises policy rates and as credit spreads widen in Europe, that creates problems obviously for one of the world’s most indebted countries, which is Italy.  I haven’t written about Italy for a while.  It was in real trouble in 2012, and that’s when Mario Draghi, in charge of the ECB, basically socialized Italy’s default risk amongst other members of the Eurozone.  Given Italy’s very high level of debt, around 150% of GDP compared to roughly 100% in the United States, Italy needs very low rates.  And every time Italy’s bond yields drift above its growth rate, its debt ratio goes up a lot.
But it looks like even though Draghi is not running the ECB anymore, his legacy remains.  The ECB looks like it’s planning yet another rescue program for Italy.  We expect an announcement sometime in July.  And as usual, the ECB is hoping that the threat of intervention will be enough to drive Italian yields back down without them actually having to buy a ton of them.  And it should be pretty obvious at this point that Italy is a permanent financial ward of the Eurozone, and the German savers who are paying for this have lost their economic independence.
The last topic I want to talk about today is this issue of gasoline prices, because the administration is really trying hard to figure out what to do about high gasoline prices.  And a lot of this has to do with the high cost we’re all paying of having made the refining industry into pariahs, effectively.  And I have some charts here.  I generally never write, talk about anything unless there’s some data that can help me and my team and all of you visualize what’s going on.  So please take a look here at page six in today’s piece, ‘cause it’s just mostly charts that will help you understand what’s going on.
So when COVID hit, there was a collapse in movement for all the obvious reasons.  And some of the refiners that were already struggling either shut their doors or converted to biofuels instead.  But now all of a sudden refined product consumption is back to pre-COVID levels in the United States, but refining capacity is not and has dropped by about a million barrels a day on a base of let’s say 19 million barrels a day.  So something like a 5 or 6% decline, it doesn’t sound like much.  But in a lot of industries, things happen on the margin.  And if you’ve got a 5 or 6 or 7% decline in refining capacity and an increase in demand for that capacity, you can get price spikes.
So just, let’s review.  The U.S. gasoline refinery shutdowns have increased in recent years, very high maintenance and repair costs, declining institutional investor interest in oil and gas, you can’t open your eyes every morning without seeing and feeling and experiencing more ESG-related pressure for people to bail on the refining industry.  That’s also affecting the banks.  There’s been declining bank lending to oil and gas.  There’s broad community and political opposition to the refining industry.  And as I mentioned, some of the refineries have shifted to biofuels, or at least are trying to.  And once these refinery shutdowns take place, they’re extremely costly and almost impossible to reverse.
And so now where are we?  Well, the refineries are operating at around 95% of capacity, very difficult in any industrial process to go above those levels.  Russia is the second-largest exporter of refined product after the U.S.  So sanctions and disruptions related to the war in Ukraine is affecting the global supply of refined products.  And you put all these pieces together, and you get a pretty big spike in the crack spread, which basically refers to refined product prices, less the cost of the crude oil that’s used in the refining process to begin with.
And I don’t think there’s a lot of easy answers here other than the demand destruction that takes place as prices go up.  In other words, there’s a gasoline price that that will result in its own demise, happened to 2008 and essentially becomes so expensive for people to drive or fly that they begin to curtail their activities.
But all the stuff that’s being discussed, whether it’s releasing the strategic petroleum reserve, bans on refined product exports are not straightforward in terms of the impact they would have on gasoline prices.  And there’s an interesting little footnote we have in this week’s paper piece that describes why an export ban might not work if it’s a ban that’s applied to all refined products because of a surplus of diesel that the refiners would end up with that they might have nowhere to go with.
And then to conclude, we’ve got some charts in here on food price inflation.  And just to tie all the pieces together, fertilizer costs are affected by natural gas, particularly nitrogenous fertilizer costs.  So now we’re at all-time highs on corn prices because of this decision to increase the ethanol blends, higher natural gas prices, a 20% decline in Russian fertilizer exports, and things like that.
So it’s a really important time for us to understand and appreciate energy and food independence and to focus on the policies that could sustain that food and energy independence on a long-term basis rather than just a short-term basis.  And that’s going to require a much more careful and thoughtful analysis about how the whole renewable transition is managed and how it unfolds.  As for the other aspects of independence which are disappearing in the United States, I wish I could talk more about those, but I can’t.  So I will thank you all for listening, and I look forward to talking to you next time.  Have a great day, bye.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.How do you want to use your resources—your time and your wealth—in a life chapter that can span many decades? First, make a plan.Amanda Lott, Head of Wealth Planning Strategy“So…What do you do?”
It’s a staple conversation starter at American cocktail parties, but it can rattle an unprepared retiree. That discomfort speaks to the trickiness of the transition to retirement. There’s great opportunity in this life chapter—but you need a plan to seize it.
While you may naturally focus on the financial aspects of retirement (and they’re undoubtedly important), they’re just one part of the story. In making this transition, you also need to balance psychological, social and emotional needs. You’re creating a new identity, after all, separate from the identity of your working years.
In our survey of retirees, among households with more than $5 million in assets, 79% said they wish they had spent more time preparing emotionally for retirement, and 64% said they wish they had spent more time preparing physically for retirement.
1
Take heed from those who have gone before you: Make a plan that encompasses all elements of the retirement experience and you’ll find yourself a happier and more confident retiree.
Be open to the unknown
Retirement is full of unknowns, and we often underestimate how difficult it can be to anticipate what’s ahead. Especially when you feel financially comfortable, it’s easy to romanticize the endless possibilities, the newfound time to do…well, whatever you want. But too much choice can be scary. A blank canvas is intimidating.
What’s more, we don’t know how long this life chapter will last. People are living longer and doing everything they can to live healthier for as much of those extra years as possible. As you enter this new stage of life, you’ll find that your priorities and the ways you spend your time change. Think about what you find most fulfilling and want your new lifestyle to include.There’s an unavoidable element of uncertainty, and that’s a challenge in thinking about how you want to use your resources—your time and your wealth—in a life chapter that can span many decades.Make a plan
You’ll find it’s much easier to manage that uncertainty if you have a plan for retirement in place. (Control what you can control and accept what you can’t.) Your plan should address some basic questions.
How will you find purpose and satisfaction in your new life? What will fill your days? Sit down with your spouse/partner and talk frankly about what you each expect from retirement. If there are differences, try to find a solid middle ground. If one of you is still working, discuss how you will manage different schedules and life rhythms.
Beyond your immediate family, where will you find a sense of community? With whom will you spend your time? Their choices and lifestyle will likely influence your own. Many of us don’t realize how our work provides important social connections in our lives. Think about what might replace your office cohort.
You don’t have to stop working altogether, of course. If you’re happy doing what you’re doing, you might opt to simply pare back. Or you could use your skills and talents for new purposes—serving on a nonprofit board, perhaps, or mentoring young people.
Tackling all these issues will help you decide how you want to spend your time and wealth. More specifically, it will help you determine how much of your wealth you want to allocate to lifestyle needs versus legacy goals for heirs and beneficiaries. How much of your wealth can be allocated to the “family bank”? The more specific you are about your goals, the more committed you will be to achieving them.
Understanding the various components of the retirement experience allows you to create a clear vision for this life chapter. A well-crafted investment strategy, one that balances liquidity, current income and long-term growth, can then be created and effectively managed over time. You can’t align an investment strategy to your retirement goals if you don’t know what they are.
Simple steps
You want to approach your retirement as though you were preparing to run a marathon.
Like a runner, you need to warm up your muscles before reaching the starting line. Here are some warm-up exercises you might try to prepare for a successful retirement.
Start 20 activities you might want to do in your retirement—and give yourself permission to quit at least 15.
Live off-season in your summer home before deciding to move.
Rent a house before relocating to a new area or to be closer to family.
Get a thorough medical exam so you can maximize your physical well-being.
Explore ways of giving back to your community.
Take a short-term consulting assignment and see if you’d like to continue the connection.
Take a class in a subject that’s long held your interest.
Above all, try a range of different options before making a full-time commitment. Don’t be afraid to shift gears, before and after you retire.
The ongoing evolution of your plan
As you’re trying out possible retirement experiences, it helps to have a feedback loop with your spouse/partner and other important people in your life so you can refine as you go along. Connect to people who are already retired to learn about the pitfalls—and pleasant surprises—they have encountered.
It’s not as though you do all your homework and boom, you’ve got a 100% foolproof plan for retirement. Options will evolve, your feelings will change, and you’ll want to talk things through with people you trust.
The new active retirement
Retirement today is nothing like it was 30 or 40 years ago when people essentially went “cold turkey” for a life of leisure. It’s a much more active life chapter.
So take your time, do your homework. Think carefully about what’s important to you and what you think will give you the greatest satisfaction in this life chapter. Try new experiences, and move on when they don’t click. When you attend that cocktail party as a newly minted retiree, you want to be proud and excited to answer the inevitable question,
What do you do?

Although we entered 2022 with a lot of uncertainty about potential tax law changes, very few of the proposals that would have impacted wealthy taxpayers were enacted.
In August, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act. The Inflation Reduction Act focused on ramping up climate- and healthcare-related spending, and left out virtually all measures that would have directly raised tax rates on individual taxpayers.
1
Now that there’s certainty about the tax landscape (until at least the end of the year and likely for a couple of years to come), taxpayers can plan with a high degree of confidence and try to minimize their 2022 tax liabilities.
We recommend you act now to determine what actions you might take before 2022 ends so that you will be best positioned financially when you file your return next year.
1. Start here: What’s your “base case”? You can find out now.
Your first step is to get a “pro forma” tax return from your tax advisor so that you can understand your current tax situation. From there, you can see what would happen if you were to realize more income or incur any additional deductions this year.
Consider asking your J.P. Morgan team for a “tax summary” to help with your tax estimates. With your tax snapshot in hand, you can better assess if it makes sense to implement tax planning strategies before year-end.
2. Can you reduce your 2022 tax liability?Tax-loss harvesting is a classic strategy that may reduce your tax liability.
2
As market volatility has been particularly high this year, your advisors might be able to help you find significant opportunities to harvest losses within your portfolio.
Harvesting losses requires you to sell an investment at a loss. You then can use this loss to offset either already-realized gains, or embedded gains that you can realize now or in the future.
If you still like the asset, you can buy it back—so long as you are careful not to violate the “wash sale rule.” This rule prevents you from taking a loss if you buy a security considered “substantially identical” within 30 days before or after the loss trade date.
3
If you do not want to be out of the position for an entire month, you might “double up” on your position (i.e., buy the identical position at the current price), then wait more than 30 days before selling the original loss position. November 29 is the last day to do so and still be able to recognize the loss in this tax year.
Of course, tax-loss harvesting isn’t limited to year-end planning. Ideally, you would review your portfolio regularly for harvesting opportunities. Indeed, you might benefit from having an account that is specifically designed to constantly look for losses and take them when appropriate opportunities arise. For more information on tax-loss harvesting, see,
“How can today’s market volatility be turned into tax benefits?”It is always advisable to try to time your charitable donations to ensure their associated deductions are effective in the intended tax year. Depending on what you plan to donate, it could take time to complete the transfer. Consult your financial institutions to understand estimated timelines to ensure your donations will be considered to have been made by the end of this year.
If you’re unsure which charity you want to support but would like the deduction for this year, you should consider donating to a donor-advised fund (DAF). Tax deductions for donations to DAFs are immediate, but the payout from the DAF to another charity does not have to be. For more information, click
here
.3.
Are you making the most of your compensation and benefits?If you can contribute to a retirement account, we recommend doing so—up to the full amount permissible. The maximum annual amounts you can contribute to retirement accounts in 2022 before year-end are:
·  IRAs
—$6,000. If you are 50 or older, it’s $7,000
·  401(k)s/403(b)s
—$20,500. If you are 50 or older, it’s $27,000
Converting assets from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA may be a smart move if you:
·
Think your future income tax rates may be higher
·
Can afford to pay the taxes with cash from other sources
·
Do not plan to leave IRA assets to charity
·
Expect the IRA to last for a whileBe sure to take your RMDs by year-end to avoid steep penalties.
If you’re charitably inclined, remember that you can make a qualified charitable distribution (QCD) from your IRA directly to a public charity (not a DAF), and the amount given will go toward satisfying your RMD.
4
If you inherited an IRA after 2019, proposed Treasury regulations interpreting the SECURE Act would require certain beneficiaries to take annual distributions over the 10-year period after inheritance instead of waiting to distribute the full account until the 10th year. IRS guidance issued in October 2022 extends the effective date of this proposal until at least 2023. However, with the uncertainty that remains about this action, you should consult with your tax advisor to determine what you should do, given your situation.
5If your employer allows you to defer your compensation, you must elect to defer your 2023 fixed salary and other non-performance-based compensation by December 31, 2022, if not earlier as specified by the employer.
With a deferral, there is no income tax liability on either the compensation or its growth until you receive it. Then, the payment will be taxed at the ordinary rates in effect when you receive the funds.  The tradeoff for this deferral is that you assume risk as a general creditor of the employer.
Once again, these types of decisions need to be taken in consideration of your expected current and future income tax rates.If you are an executive, you may want to exercise some of your options in 2022.
The important question is: Which ones?
Good candidates generally include those options that:
1. Are deep-in-the-money;
2. Are on high-dividend-paying stocks; or
3. Have a short time to expiry
This year’s market volatility can make this decision more complicated, so reach out to your J.P. Morgan team for an “options breakeven” analysis.4. Are you giving tax-wisely to your children?Do you have a taxable estate, the capacity and desire to gift, and a lifetime gift and estate tax exclusion remaining?
Then you may want to use it now while the exclusion amount is at an all-time high. An individual can now transfer, tax-free, $12.06 million (married couples can transfer twice that).
This exclusion amount is set to decrease to $5 million (inflation-adjusted) after 2025, so think about acting soon to lock in the extra gifting potential.
Your J.P. Morgan team can help quantify your gifting capacity so that you can transfer assets without jeopardizing your own financial security in the future.Every year, most U.S. taxpayers also have the opportunity to give, without any gift taxes due, an “annual gift tax exclusion” amount to as many individuals as they choose, and for whatever present use. This year, it’s $16,000; for married couples, it’s $32,000.
The annual gift tax exclusion is a “use-it-or-lose-it” opportunity; if you don’t make a gift this year, you can’t “double up” next year and have half the gift treated as having been made this year.
Parents and grandparents often use their annual gift tax exclusions to fund 529 accounts, where the funds can grow free of federal taxes. As long as the money is used for the account beneficiary’s qualified education expenses, no federal income or gift tax will be due on distributions.5. Are you getting the help you need?
These are just a few examples of the many opportunities you may have right now to strengthen your financial health before year-end.
Speak with your tax advisor about which actions may be right for you. You also can ask your J.P. Morgan team to work with your tax advisor to help you evaluate how any actions you might take would align with your long-term financial goals.
The sooner you have these discussions, the more benefit you may be able to reap from your year-end planning.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.A quick guide to what you may want to examine—and when.Raquel Porter, Head of U.S. Estates
People with significant assets know they need a solid estate plan to ensure their wealth is used as they desire. It obviously takes a lot of work to create these roadmaps for your family’s future.
But if you want to be sure your plan will actually accomplish what you intend, you still have to regularly check that your estate plan is up-to-date as life events occur, and financial and tax circumstances change.
Here, we offer a quick list to help you stay aware of when you should stress test your estate plan, and what you should review.
Circumstances change
It’s time for you and your advisors to take a fresh look at your estate planning documents when there have been significant changes in:
Your balance sheet
—If your asset composition and size have changed significantly since you first created your plan, review your balance sheet with your advisors. If your assets have grown significantly, are you comfortable with the amount of assets going to your beneficiaries? Do you have sufficient liquidity to cover your estate’s potential tax burden?
Your family members
—Births, adoptions, marriages, divorces and deaths all may require adjustments to your estate planning and trusts.
Market volatility
—When markets drop, you should look at your planned giving to make sure you will still have enough for yourself and your dependents. Down markets can also create an opportunity for you to gift “beaten up” assets, thereby transferring more wealth to loved ones while using less of your lifetime gift exclusion amount.
Tax laws
—Keep an eye on changes to federal and state tax laws that may impact your investments and your estate plan.
Closely held assets
—If you own a business, make sure your succession plans are also up-to-date. If you have already sold that business, speak with your advisors to see whether any revisions to your estate plan are needed.
Check that you have the right person to handle your affairs
Settling an estate involves winding down all aspects of your personal financial, tax and business affairs. The larger the estate, and the more complex the assets, the greater the time and effort required.
You may want to name a corporate executor to support your family through the process because:
It can take three or more years to fully close an estate—even when a team of experienced estate professionals are handling the process.
Serving as executor is a demanding, full-time job that can be overwhelming for a friend or family member, especially during a time of grief. And mistakes can be costly.
It also happens that someone who agreed to serve as your executor when you first drew up your estate plan may no longer be ready, willing or able to do so when the time comes.
Be sure the basics are (still) in place
It is also wise to periodically inventory your assets, identifying where they are held, and how they are titled and safeguarded.
Know what you have, and update your records.
This includes all your financial investments, digital assets, retirement accounts, insurance policies, deeds, and contents and location of any safe deposit boxes.
Look carefully at how your assets are owned.
We cannot overemphasize how important it is for you to know whether the assets are held jointly or solely, as titling can make a big difference in how assets transfer to people.
If you have a revocable trust, make sure that your assets are retitled in the trust. By properly funding your trust, you ensure that your trust works as designed and avoids the likelihood of a probate proceeding upon your death.
Confirm beneficiary designations are updated.
Retirement accounts, such as IRAs, 401(k)s and insurance policies, pass by “beneficiary designation,” not by what is stated in your will.
It is critical that you name both primary and contingent beneficiaries. If you fail to do so, your assets will pass according to whatever your retirement plan lists or whomever the insurance provider has as its default beneficiary (typically that will be your estate or, if you’re married, your spouse).
If your life circumstances change (due to divorce, remarriage, birth of a child, etc.), you may want to change your intended beneficiaries.
Ask the next generation for their (latest) perspective
If you’re going to give money to the next and future generations, you’ll want to check that your gifts, trusts and bequests are structured in such a way that supports their lives and ambitions.
No matter how emotionally close you may be to the young people in your family, it’s best not to assume you already fully understand them. For one thing, different generations by definition often have their own perspectives, even world views.
So, for example:
Marriage
—Younger generations are getting married later and therefore tend to accumulate more individual assets before marrying, which can have significant implications for their wealth planning. In 2019, only 44% of Millennials (born 1981–1996) were married, compared with 53% of Gen Xers (1965–1980), 61% of Baby Boomers (1946–1964) and 81% of the Silent Generation (1928–1945) at a similar age.
1
Philanthropy
—As we noted in “
Your Children, Your Trusts: How to Bridge Generational Gaps
,” Millennials and Gen Z are more likely to donate to charity than any other generation. Many times, trust documents are written to distribute funds to beneficiaries according to the ascertainable standard (to help pay for their health, education, maintenance and support). However, this standard provision wouldn’t allow your children to withdraw trust funds to support their philanthropic endeavors. You can put in place alternative structures that would help your beneficiaries support nonprofits.
Be sure to ask each one of your younger family members, individually, about their hopes, dreams and values—and check in with them often. Involving younger family members early and often in your estate planning and trust creation are critical because, bottom line, you are all building your family legacy together.
Make provisions for any “passions and pursuits” assets
Consider non-financial assets. You may own tangible personal property of significant value—art work, cars, yachts, planes and other collectibles, etc.
Such assets should be appraised periodically as well as properly insured and safeguarded. They can also be difficult to divide among heirs and financially burdensome for them to maintain after you are gone.
It’s best if you, far in advance, think through and occasionally revisit how you wish to distribute such treasures.
Solid plans often make use of such strategies as:
Transferring ownership of these assets to a limited liability company (LLC).
This approach can help protect you now (both from liabilities associated with the property and from public knowledge of your ownership). You also might gift shares in that LLC over time to next generations so their inheritances and responsibilities may be absorbed gradually.
Setting aside funds to pay the taxes on, and to maintain, these assets.
Make sure your estate plan reflects your intention on who bears the payment of taxes and expenses.
Create an exit strategy.
One or more of the heirs who receive these assets may not wish to have them over the long haul. You should consider thinking through the circumstances under which one heir might buy out another; or how the assets might be sold.

Sarah Backer, Wealth Planning Strategy
If you have a 401(k) or traditional IRA, you’ll need to take required minimum distributions (RMDs) each year once you meet a certain age – or face harsh penalties. But not all RMD rules are easy to understand. That’s why it’s important to get familiar with the rules and speak with your J.P. Morgan team each year. Besides helping you avoid pitfalls, we can also explore strategies together that may increase the value of your retirement accounts.
RMD rules to know: Who, when and how much
If you own a retirement account and have reached age 72, generally you will need to take an annual RMD each year before December 31.
1
,
2
First year exception:
You can delay taking your first RMD until April 1 of the year following the year you turn 72. However, if you delay your first RMD, you will end up taking two in that year.
If you don’t take your RMDs on time, you face paying tax penalties of up to 50% of the outstanding RMD you’re due.
Note that you are responsible for calculating your RMDs for the year. However, in many cases, you can request that your IRA or 401(k) provider automatically calculate the RMD for accounts they hold. Either way, the chart below will give you an idea of how much to expect each year.Understanding your options
While the rules for retirement accounts may be complicated, you have options for RMDs. Depending on your situation or needs, you can make decisions that can significantly alter how much you or your beneficiaries receive. Here are some options that may be available to you:
If you don’t need or want the income:
You can avoid adding some of the RMD amount to your taxable income for the year by giving it to charity. To do this, you can have up to $100,000 distributed directly to a qualified charity as a Qualified Charitable Distribution (QCD), and that amount will go toward satisfying your RMD. You will not receive a charitable tax deduction for the amount, since you did not have to report the distribution as income; however, you may choose the charity. Note that donor-advised funds or private foundations are not eligible recipients for QCDs.
If you have multiple traditional IRAs and want to simplify the accounting:
You can calculate the RMD for each IRA but take all your RMDs from just one account. Different rules apply to other types of retirement accounts, such as 401(k)s.
If you need or want more income sooner rather than later:
Taking only the RMD is usually the most tax-efficient choice. However, as the IRA owner, you can always withdraw more if it makes sense to do so based on your individual circumstances.
If you are worried about potential future tax law changes or want to explore how you might maximize your retirement accounts for your heirs:
Consider converting your traditional IRA into a
Roth IRA
. This would mean paying U.S. and state income taxes in the year of the conversion, but it would exempt any future growth from income taxes and RMDs. There are several different factors to determine if a conversion might make sense—your age, liquidity outside of the IRA, future income tax rates and IRA beneficiaries. Your J.P. Morgan team and tax advisors can help you consider your different options and what might make the most sense for your situation.
Inherited RMDs: What path should you take?
If you inherit an IRA, you may want to stretch out the RMDs for as long as possible. This gives the money in the account more time to grow on a tax-deferred basis. Below is a general summary of your options if you inherit an IRA. It’s important to note that proposed regulations issued by the Treasury Department and IRS earlier this year could change how these options work. These proposed regulations are not yet final or effective and this table reflects one interpretation of the 10-year rule.
3Note that the above table shows the
minimum
amount you’ll need to take. You can always take more than this amount, up to the full account balance.
If the beneficiary of an inherited IRA passes, the account is then transferred to the beneficiaries the original beneficiary has designated. In this case, the minimum distribution schedule is not reset, but continues according to the original schedule set by the first inheritor of the account.
We can help
It isn’t always easy to understand your choices or the rules you’ll need to follow when it comes to your retirement accounts. Your J.P. Morgan team can help make sure you not only take your RMDs properly every year, but also make the most of your retirement accounts so that you may reach your financial goals.
1
Applies to anyone who turned 70½ after 12/31/2019. Prior to the SECURE Act passed in 2019, RMDs began at age 70½.
2
For Roth IRAs, an original owner has no RMD. For Qualified Retirement Plans, an original account owner might be able to start RMDs later than age 72 if he/she is currently working at the employer sponsor of the plan, the plan documents permit the delay, and the owner is not a 5% owner of the employer.
3
This table reflects the rules created after the SECURE Act of 2019 and one interpretation of the 10-year rule. These rules only apply to accounts where the owner died after December 31, 2019. Accounts inherited before that date do not fall within this legislation.
Proposed regulations issued by the Treasury Department and IRS in early 2022 would require that non-eligible designated beneficiaries of inherited IRAs and defined contribution plans (e.g., 401(k) plans) take annual distributions if the decedent was already taking RMDs, rather than potentially waiting until the end of year 10 to take the entire amount. IRS guidance issued in October 2022 extends the effective date of this proposal until at least 2023. The proposed regulations are not yet final or effective. We are still awaiting final guidance to see if Treasury and IRS make any changes to the proposed rules. It is not clear, as of the date of publication, whether clients in this scenario will be required to take annual RMDs, so we recommend that clients consult their tax advisor.This chart explains how to calculate your RMDs. Divide your account balance on December 31 of the previous year by the “distribution period” number from IRS tables. Worksheets are available at www.irs.gov. Then you will get that year’s required minimum distributionThis table provides a general summary of your options if you inherit an IRA. If the owner died before beginning RMDs: A spouse can treat the account as their own OR take annual distributions based on their life expectancy but may delay starting until the year the account owner would have turned 72. A minor child, disabled or chronically ill, or no more than 10 years younger than original owner can withdraw the entire account within 10 years of the owner’s death or take RMDs based on their life expectancy. Another individual can withdraw the entire account within 10 years of the owner’s death. Beneficiaries are not required to take distributions during the 10-year period and can fully distribute the plan at the end. An entity can withdraw the entire account within five years of the owner’s death. Special rules apply if a trust is the beneficiary. Consult your tax and legal advisors. If the owner died after beginning RMDs: A spouse can treat the account as their own OR take annual distributions based on their life expectancy or the owner’s life expectancy as of his/her year of death, whichever is longer. A minor child, disabled or chronically ill, or no more than 10 years younger than original owner, can take RMDs based on their life expectancy or the original owner’s. Another individual can withdraw the entire account within 10 years of the owner’s death. Beneficiaries are not required to take distributions during the 10-year period and can fully distribute the plan at the end. An entity can take annual distributions based on the owner’s life expectancy as of his/her year of death. Special rules apply if a trust is the beneficiary.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Apps often ask for more user information than they need. Be selective about what you allow.Phil Ferraro, Global Head of Cyber Advisory­
Michelle Maratto, Cyber Advisory
By law, mobile apps must ask for your permission to access information stored on your digital device(s). However, they’re free to ask for more of your private data than they need to function smoothly.
Startlingly, most people give mobile apps unfettered access to the personal data stored on their device: According to a Pew Research Center survey, only about one in five American adults say they always read a company’s privacy policy before agreeing to it.
1
Yet, to skip reading the fine print is to magnify the risk of having your personal information exposed, lost or stolen.
The best way to protect your digital privacy is to selectively limit the permission you grant each app currently on your mobile device(s). (For example, you might allow a social media app to access your photo library but not your calendar or contacts directory.)
Answering the five questions below can help you get started:
1. What am I risking?
Potentially, a lot.
To bolster revenues, most apps sell their users’ likes/dislikes, location data, shopping preferences and other personal information to a vast array of third-party outlets. For example, to vendors who use the information for targeted or location-based advertising purposes.
As your data is sold and resold, your potential exposure to identity theft and fraud increases.
Data privacy tip:
Before you download an app, read its privacy policy to understand what information the app will be able to access and how it will be used and/or shared. Review your account settings for each app currently on your device(s), and repeat the process each time it updates its software/services.
2. Aren’t all permission requests the same?
No. Some apps genuinely need access to various parts of your device. Others overreach to bolster their own bottom lines.
For example, to post photos on popular social media platforms or scan QR codes, you’ll need to grant access to your camera or photo library. But what else are they asking for?
By granting permission that’s overly broad, you open the door to your personal information being bought and sold in an endless chain of third-party transactions—potentially ending up in the hands of fraudsters.
Data privacy tip:
Be mindful of the broad implications of allowing an app to access your location, camera, photo library or other personal details.
3. What if I don’t understand the fine print?
Take your time to consider what an app is asking permission for—and be guided by common sense:
You know why a ride-sharing app needs access to your location and your phone number. But why should they have access to your camera or calendar?
Be mindful of how much of your data privacy you are putting at risk in exchange for a small convenience, such as receiving personalized alerts.
A voice recording app needs access to your microphone, but a game app? Remember: Any app that has access to your microphone can potentially listen to what you're saying and doing at any time.
Keep in mind: Granting broad access to your private information may impair how well your mobile device functions. For example, your device’s storage space may quickly fill up; its battery life may be shortened; or the operating system’s speed may slow. Uninstalling apps you no longer use may help boost your device’s overall performance.
Data privacy tip:
Only download apps from your device’s official app store. This will help reduce the risk of installing malware. Also, keep your device’s operating system up to date by downloading security updates and patches as they are released.
4. Who needs to track my location?
Increasingly, location-tracking software applications are invading our lives. While identifying your location may be helpful in certain circumstances, routinely exposing your whereabouts and location patterns can put you or your loved ones at risk—physically, reputationally and/or financially.
A key way to stop your device from tracking your every move: Go to your device's Settings, on an Apple device turn off Significant Locations or on an Android/Google device turn off Location History. Instructions vary, according to the operating system installed.
Data privacy tip:
After adjusting your settings, go through your mobile apps one at a time and adjust your permissions to your level of risk comfort.
5. Should I worry if my mobile device broadcasts my name?
Yes. It’s one more way personal information is exposed.
Your name/device name appears in your settings. If it’s innocuous (“phone” or “tablet,” for example), your identity is secure. However, if your device’s name is directly associated with you, you’re vulnerable to hackers finding out who you are.
Data privacy tip:
Rename your device to make it non-identifiable.

Maya: Hi, I'm Maya, and welcome to JP Morgan's Spotlight on Family Governance series.
In this episode, we welcome Rodolfo Paiz, a third generation member of a successful business family from Guatemala, who is himself, an advisor to business families in the Americas.
His family was an early pioneer in Latin America of intentionally developing their family governance protocols.
He's also founder of a family office designed and intended to last 100 years. He lives in North America.
I'm truly thrilled to explore with Rodolfo what family governance means to him and how his families, both his family of birth and his client families, have cultivated their relationships as a family, and what is their secret source to nurturing entrepreneurship in multiple generations?
Welcome, Rodolfo.
Rodolfo Paiz: Thank you, Maya.
Maya: Let's start by giving our listeners a bit more background about you and your family, and your work.
Rodolfo Paiz: I come from a really great family. It's nice to be able to say that. Most of us have a fairly complex history to tell, but my family did a lot that I could learn from. I was too young to really participate in much of what was going on, but old enough to see it and learn from it firsthand.
My family started really with my grandfather who was orphaned and he failed at several businesses, but every time, he picked himself up and paid back anyone he still owed from his prior ventures, and so he built up a reputation.
And when he was 25, he was able to set up a little shop with the inventory on consignment because people trusted him. And that time he didn't fail.
And so the family always grew on core values of ethical conduct always, hard work, education and learning, and really service to our employees, to our community.
My grandfather echoed a lot of the teachings of Disney, and Ford, and others, about stakeholder capitalism and looking after the people around you, not just your own pocket. And my family defined success as being respected, trusted, and at peace with yourself, not about how much money you have.
So the family ended up with a great many firsts in business, either in Guatemala or across central America.
I believe we were the first company to incorporate and allow employees to own shares. We were the first to set up a pension plan. We were the first to set up profit sharing. We were the first to do health insurance for employees. We were the first to do self-service supermarket in central America. And there's a fairly long list of that.
We were also one of the first families to work on family systems governance.
And I found governance fascinating. My family hired one of the leading consultants in the field when I was nine, and so I literally grew up with my family in one ear, a consultant in the other. And over time, I realized really more than a business person, my soul is of a teacher and a guide, and I realized that there's a science to family systems, that families in business are more successful than non-family businesses. That most of the negative images of family businesses and families is a myth, but that you really do have to follow the rules to get results. So in the end, I've made it my career to teach and guide other families.
When you hear me talk about my families or our families, we are lumping in both my family of origin and many of our client families, because that's all we do for nearly 20 years now. We just provide good advice and guidance to families in business, and that's where we are today.
Maya: Rudolfo, I just really love what you said about the thing that what success means to you as a family is to be respected, trusted, and for people to be at peace, the family to be at peace. Absolutely wonderful.
And many people hear the term family governance, let's start there, and you've mentioned it now as well, and are often confused by what this means. It seems, to some people, to signify bureaucracy.
I wonder if you could share some thoughts as to what family governance means to you.
Rodolfo Paiz: It seems like these days, governance is one of those secrets that is the key to eternal youth, but it really shouldn't be seen as either a secret or anything complex.
First off, governance is not any particular document, any family constitution. It's not a council, a structure. It's not a trust. It's not any of the mechanisms that are often seen.
And governance is not a corporate thing. Governance is a universal concept and it applies to everything. It's everywhere. It's a bit like the Force in Star Wars. You can have a light side and a dark side, but it's everywhere in the universe.
And really governance is how and why we do whatever it is we do. To what limit? To what extent? By what rules?
So as a person, you have individual governance. You choose what kind of food you eat and when. You choose how much exercise you get, how much you care for your sleep. You choose how you treat your friends. You decide how you want to live your life. And that is governance.
Those decisions about who am I and how do I want to live this, that's governance.
If you get together with your Tuesday night poker group, there's governance there. Who brings what? What are the rules on betting? What's fair? What's not accepted? Everything has governance, individuals, families, businesses, countries, everything. And the more you understand that this is the most normal thing on earth, the most universal thing on earth, and you just deal with it as part of your daily life instead of thinking it's complicated and overthinking it, the easier it gets.
Does that make sense?
Maya: Absolutely. And you shared with a wonderful example of governance in practice in your family, which is very simple, and I think absolutely beautiful. I'd love you to tell that.
Rodolfo Paiz: Well, yes. I think that the key words for governance are appropriate and functional. You have to have the kind of governance that works for you and you have to make decisions that are appropriate for where you are. There is no one size fits all argument.
In fact, sometimes the best decision you can make is to take apart and dismantle some of the family businesses or even all of the family businesses, because that'll be better for renewal, for rebirth, or because the world has changed.
The case you mentioned is one where my family of origin, my birth family, grew to a point where we had 100 plus supermarkets and I believe 20,000 plus employees, but family governance and corporate governance was one single Tuesday morning meeting, every Tuesday, all morning, and you're there unless you're dead or in the hospital.
And it was my father and his siblings, and a couple of key non-family executives who kept them honest, served as a memory aid, and were part of the team. And any possible issue that could be brought up, whether family, business, ownership related, everything came to the Tuesday morning PC meeting.
PC was even a reference to an earlier venture that they had attempted to install called the Paiz Consultants, which had failed.
They had tried to set something up. It didn't work and they kept the PC name as a reminder that on Tuesday morning they were consultants to themselves and they needed to do a good job.
And what I like about that is it's simple. It worked. People assume that a large business needs complex governance, and it's just not true.
If it's a business with five siblings who control everything, then as long as you can get those five siblings, they're on a table, you've got what you need.
Maya: Absolutely. I hosted a family just last week and what they had decided on was a family meeting on a Saturday morning where they would discuss their investments, their philanthropy, and then have a lovely lunch together.
And everyone knows that it's on the last Saturday of every month. It's repeatable, it's regular, and that's what you are describing as well. Something that's repeatable, regular, everyone knows they have to be there. They clear their diaries for it, and it's as simple as that.
Rodolfo Paiz: And it's the right decision for that family at that time. It works for them because that's the key.
In fact, I'd like to segue onto that to one important point, perhaps the most important point of all, that family is doing one thing very, very right because they have realized that the family itself is more important than the business.
The family enterprise world has changed over the last 30, 40 years, and around 2010, some new research came out that really changed the course of the industry.
Before, we used to think that the family business was the most important part and the family should work around the business, and the business should be given priority.
Now we understand that the family is the most important part of the system. The family over years, and decades, and generations will build experience and build a diversified portfolio of businesses. But it's not the business that's important. It's the family. That's what really leads to success. Even if you define success purely as commercial material success, the most important thing to work on is the family.
Maya: Yes. And you said right at the start that I come from a wonderful family, so it really shows.
And it's very interesting that you say that as most people may assume that it's the business or managing financial assets that should come first.
I wonder if you could say a bit more about how you have really nurtured that sense of family and that sense of connection within your family. Maybe just a couple of points or practical things that people can do.
Rodolfo Paiz: Yeah. First, I think that it has to be hammered in that every family needs to find their own answers, but there are some common threads.
One major common thread is knowing where you are and who you are.
In the 1990s book, Succeeding Generations by Ivan Lansberg and Kelin Gersick, there's a wonderful illustration where it says the first generation or one where the business is controlled by a single founder or a single owner is like a tennis game. Usually, you have the owner and spouse, whether that's male or female in each case, and it's a tennis game. There are no real rules to how we play our positions. We just want to hit the ball. If I fall, you cover the court. If you fall, I cover the entire court. Very simple.
When you have a second generation group of siblings managing a business, then you have a basketball game. You have positions, but many of the plays still need to be improvised. It's very fluid. There's the captain, but that captain is a leader not a boss.
[Foreign language 00:12:50] is in Latin, first among equals.
And once you really get into a family system where you have several family branches and cousins, and multiple businesses, now you're running a league. Whether that's a soccer league or the United Nations, but you now have a full league. Everything needs to be documented. There need to be contracts. Everything need to be market price.
Because we didn't all grow up in the same house, we don't have exactly the same experiences, common stories, and values, and so the family needs to see where they are.
One of the biggest problems I see in multiple families is the second generation showing up to a basketball game with a rocket. And it just doesn't work.
Because your parents did it for 30 years with great results does not mean it'll work for you.
Now, what does work for everyone is knowing yourself and finding the things that really enrich your experience. Almost universally, family time needs to be sacred. There should be a family vacation, a family trip, lots of dinners. We need to really treat the holidays that are important to us, religious, secular, whatever, as sacred to us. If it's Saturday morning meeting, if it's Sunday dinner, those need to be important.
And we also need to know how to balance in this family and at this time, the pull toward being more together and more collective, but also giving space for individuality, and freedom, and expression.
Sometimes the greatest benefit to our family will come from somebody leaving because they're toxic or somebody leaving because they want to go explore the world, and they'll come back to us later with more to contribute.
So it's not more is always better. It's not closer is always better. It's what is going to work best for us, and the keyword there is always balance and family.
Maya: Absolutely. That's wonderful. And in fact, in the freedom comes greater, draw towards connection, rather ironically.
One of the things that your family and the families you work with have been wonderful at is really thinking about being entrepreneurial. And this is a question that we are asked a lot, which is how can you really encourage an entrepreneurial spirit in each generation? And I just wondered if you could share some thought on fostering entrepreneurism.
Rodolfo Paiz: Oh, yes. Yes. Lots. Let's try to keep this a bit brief because I can spend a couple hours on this topic. But it's really important to share failure as well as success.
The family leaders, the senior generations that try to hide failure from their kids or protect their kids from failures are setting themselves and their children up for failure by doing so.
We work with a wonderful family in Costa Rica where dad is simply an amazing business leader. The man is really outstanding, even among the people we know. But his greatest strength is that he is constantly humble and constantly listening, and he takes feedback, and he listens to everybody, his kids, us as his advisors, everyone, and he learns and he applies, and he makes it a point to explain to his kids where he went wrong, what he did wrong, how he failed, because everybody needs to understand the individual and the family that failure is inevitable. What is not inevitable is learning from it and using it to grow.
Failure can be crippling, but that's your choice.
But trying to avoid failure, like trying to avoid pain, only leads to families, and people, and businesses who are not resilient, who can't pick themselves up and move on and grow stronger.
You need to treat failure like a broken bone that grows back stronger, and not treat your children like fine china that if it falls once, will shatter forever.
You also want to reduce the cost of failure. You want to make it easier and more fun to try and experiment to try something new because if it doesn't work, that's okay.
There are things you should never do. You should never lie, steal, or cheat, but go on and try your own business. Try and adventure. Go on, fail. That's how you learn.
Maya: And that's key to every entrepreneur. They all talk about their stories, if they really reflect on it, and say, ""Here were the really down moments, and it was my resilience, and grit, and just pushing through and not being afraid of failure that helped me to succeed."" And clearly, being able to share some of that with the next generation is hugely helpful.
Rodolfo Paiz: And if you can take from a moment, a dive into academia and philosophy. If you look at Maslow's hierarchy of needs, the worst suffering you've experienced feels like hell. And to people who've actually been hungry, who haven't had enough to eat, who've suffered serious hardship, they shrug off many of the little things in daily life that can go wrong.
But if you've coddled your kids and you've spoiled them, and they haven't had to deal with a problem in their life, and you've solved all of their problems or prevented them from facing problems, those kids are going to grow up believing that a hangnail is the end of the world, or they didn't get the color rug they wanted for their private jet is the end of the world.
You want them to be a little cold and a little hungry sometimes. It sounds a little cruel, but you want them to suffer a little bit because that is the only way the human race learns.
Maya: Rudolfo, thank you so much for sharing your ideas, and your insights, and your wisdom with our listeners. Perhaps in conclusion, if there is one piece of advice you might give families just getting started and thinking about their own journey of family governance for the first time, what advice might you offer them?
Rodolfo Paiz: So first piece of advice will follow logically from what we've already said. Don't make it too complicated. Don't overthink it. Don't get sucked into making it harder than it is. Be aware that for a family, dealing with intangible issues, like how do we set up rules for ourselves and what agreements, because agreements is a better word than rules, will help us get along better and be more productive together, there's a tendency to want to avoid simply paying for advice.
People tend to focus on tangible products. If I'm going to pay somebody, I want something delivered to me, and so it creates an unhealthy dynamic where you may find many consultants selling a product, a report, a deliverable, a family protocol, or a family constitution that you don't need, but you're more likely to buy that because it's tangible.
Now, the family constitution and the family protocol are a subject for another day, but they are essential tools for families whose systems, whether the family, or the system, or the business has become highly complex.
But for a family of a few people who have one or two businesses, even if those businesses are quite successful, if there's not a very high complexity, there's no real need for the family protocol constitution yet.
I know families with three siblings who are on their fourth family protocol and it means nothing. It's just a piece of paper. They don't need it yet. So don't overthink it.
Also, over time, we built a tool at Fidelis we call the Iceberg Methodology because it uses the iceberg cliche to explain the importance of different levels.
The lowest level of the iceberg, the one that's deepest underwater is the family because the water's colder down there. The currents are stronger. There's less light. And it's hard to work on those issues, is you have to be respectful, and compassionate, and kind.What they call soft skills are actually much harder, but those are the important parts.
After you work on family, you need to work on education, on learning what you need to know. And with that, you need to work on governance.
Family, education and governance are the three bottom layers and the three most crucial layers of the iceberg because those will determine the success of everything else you do.
If we're talking wealth advisory, and I've always been a fan of the work you do with the team at JP Morgan, really the wealth, and in wealth, I include reputational wealth, financial, social, intellectual, how healthy and happily your family is, to keep your wealth above water, you need to worry about all the ice that's underneath it, because if you don't deal with the family, the education, the governance, your wealth sinks.
Maya: I love that, Rodolfo. Such a simple and effective, and strong message for us all.
Family, education, and governance. That is really the baseline for everything.
Thank you so much for this lovely conversation.
Rodolfo Paiz: Thank you, Maya. I think I'll echo something you said to me ages ago, and it was that most people are too afraid to talk about their failures and their problems to outsiders. And the key lesson families can take away is to actually seek advice.
Maya: Absolutely. Thank you so much.
Rodolfo Paiz: Oh, not at all. I'm delighted to be here and thank you for the invitation.Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.

Speaker 2: Welcome to our Spotlight on Family Governance podcast, a part of JP Morgan's Life and Legacy series and I'm your host Maya Prabhu. In this episode, we welcome Frederic Hoffmann, a fifth generation member of a business family from Switzerland. Frederic devotes his time to supporting entrepreneurs in both the non-profit and commercial organizations. He focuses on sustainability strategies and enjoys working on innovative projects. Frederic has entrepreneurial experience and in 2018, built a venture fund investing in food and agricultural technology. Today, Frederic serves on the board of and advises, several Cleantech startups and also philanthropic organizations, including the Mava Foundation, which was established by his grandfather. He's a world economic forum, young global leader and in 2021, 22, he's doing an executive MSC in social business and entrepreneurship at the London School of Economics. Welcome Frederic, thank you for joining us.
Speaker 3: Hi Maya, thank you very much for having me.
Speaker 2: Frederic, you are interested in sustainability strategies in both the business and philanthropic spheres of your life. Can you take us back to how you were inspired to get involved in this space and to really make it a core purpose for your work?
Speaker 3: Yes, absolutely. Yeah. I grew up in quite an environmentally minded family and I think there was always a bit of an obvious decision that whatever you do, positive environmental impact has to be at the center of that. I don't see why you would want to devote career to something that isn't doing that, so it's always been a bit of an obvious choice for me. But specifically looking at business and nonprofit strategies, I think has really been influenced actually by my experience with Mava foundation, when I was just out of Uni, one of my first sort of side mandates was joining the board of the Mava Foundation.
At the time, a lot of the conversations were around our next strategy for the next period and that was about building institutional resilience with our partners and so a lot of conversations in 2014, 15, 16, about business models for conservation and for sustainability, which got me very excited. This idea that blending commercial sectors and not for profit sectors actually can yield some really interesting human organizations with outcomes beyond capital return or beyond return on money. So that I think, is really where it started and I'm realizing now when I say 2015, that's seven years ago, so it's been quite a while.
Speaker 2: Wow. I'm sure it's been a really exciting period of exploration and discovery as well as, the field has developed so much and it's become more common now. There are more opportunities available to really put your passion at the heart of the way you do your philanthropy and also your business life and that they don't need to be separate.
Speaker 3: It is great that sustainability has moved into the mainstream and so obviously, it means we have a new set of challenges, which is to make sure that we do it right and we don't just do it because we all think that it's a good thing to do. We actually need to do it properly, but it's a very nice challenge to have, I think.
Speaker 2: Absolutely. Tell us about the origins of the Mava Foundation. How did your grandfather get started in philanthropy and what did he hope that the foundation might achieve?
Speaker 3: Yes, absolutely. So my grandfather was a zoologist by trade and ornithologist, so focusing on birds and migration, specific topic of interest, as well as the habitats in the wetlands of the Mediterranean. But, his day job and a lot of his work was in the pharmaceutical industry and so he had these two big elements in his life, I think. The foundation, which was actually only founded in 1994, the work started way before, about 50 years earlier at the end of the second world war, when he started being able to leave Switzerland and support projects of nature conservation. Notably in the Camargue in the South of France, but also in the [inaudible 00:05:08] in West Africa and in the Prespa region of Northern Greece. So his personal interest really led it and I think for the first large period, it was him supporting in a private way, his friends in the field, and then that formalized in the late nineties and early two thousands, started to become more of, we could call it an institution or more of a formal secretariat at least.
Then when I joined in 2015, we were developing a much more robust and program driven strategy, in part because my grandfather was getting quite old and also because the foundation from the beginning was a spend down foundation. So a foundation which had an end date, which happens to be 2022, so we're running towards the end. A big part of this strategy that we were developing at the time is, how do we work with our partners to make sure that they're resilient and sustainable in an economical way, beyond the departure of the foundation, which has been a fascinating task, which I'm sure we'll have an opportunity to talk about today.
Speaker 2: Yes, most definitely and it's really remarkable that he made that decision around spending down. More and more philanthropists in my experience are starting to adopt that approach but certainly, at the time that he was thinking about it, it was still relatively new. Can you tell us a bit more about this decision, what you think might have been going through his mind to decide to do that?
Speaker 3: Yeah. Yes. I think ironically to your question, what probably was going through his mind is, I don't want people to put words in my mouth after I've gone. He passed away a few years ago now, so I never actually had the chance to have a conversation about why spend down, but I can tell you what it's forced us to do, is have a real deep think about what it is that a foundation's mission is. Especially a foundation like the Mava foundation, which works across three different geographies on the topic of humans and nature and creating symbiotic relationships in which nature can thrive.
It did get us thinking about the idea that our role isn't necessarily to support these projects over the very long term, but to contribute to creating systems in which nature is valued in a way that means that it isn't under pressure. So our mission in a way has been, or at least our activities over the past few years, have been really to work with the people who are local to the problem, to understand how we can influence the economic pressures on landscapes to create more resilient and long term systems. Our partners have been phenomenal in this journey because they've also shown a lot of open mindedness about what it means to be an environmental NGO or local association going forward.
Speaker 2: That's a really important thing to remember for all philanthropists is exactly what you're saying. That while the funding organizations have the money and the resources to help support work, the local partners are real experts in what they do and it is really a partnership between those two things.
Speaker 3: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: It also really strikes me listening to you and what you were saying about your grandfather's strategy to establish a spend down foundation. I'm very struck by the real legacy that he has left in terms of, obviously funding and seeding some really important environmental work and conservation work and ensuring through the foundation's work that those organizations remain financially sustainable in the longer term. But also, part of that legacy is the real interest and inspiration that he has created within the family around conservation and the environment and the impact that you can have and you are a sort of living example of that, as it were.
Speaker 3: I think I might actually, if I can intervene with an idea, I think you mentioned the word family. Within the Mava system, let's call it, we actually call it the Mava family because it is a lot more broad and maybe a little anecdote about just thinking you had mentioned before how it all started. It started, I guess, with his passion and a lot of the people who were by his side at the beginning still are today. They've grown up through, or at least they've grown there, their careers, working along his side and now beyond. Actually, it's quite funny, if you walk around the Mava office today, most people will refer to him as Pappy, which means grandfather. That's what we call grandfather in Switzerland, rather than Dr. Hoffmann. So I think that's just a nice way to reflect that the family and the legacy that he did leave behind is far broader than the genetic family, which is fantastic because that's also is a sign of proactivity among the community. We're very lucky to be able to work along the side of people who've been touched along the way by him.
Speaker 2: To create such a wonderful sense of family-ness amongst everyone working there, whether you're a family member or an expert or a partner, how wonderful. It's one of the reasons I love working with family enterprises, this real sense of family-ness and in the culture of the organizations that are established. Let's talk about you and your role. You were the first member of the fifth generation to join the board. How did you approach preparing for your role?
Speaker 3: Well, I think a key thing for me... So at that point in my life, I was just finishing my undergraduate studies in development, economics and geography and I think a key thing for me was to sit down and listen as much as possible. The first, we have four or five board meetings per year, depending on the year and it was really a period of trying to understand what actually happens within this foundation, how a foundation's run. I think that did evolve quite quickly into realizing that, as a younger generation with maybe a more modern education, I did have a perspective that was useful.
So for me personally, it was quite an interesting learning experience because I learned that my voice was quite useful within that setting. [inaudible 00:11:48] in my professional life, the choices I've made in terms of which partners I'd work with and which projects I get involved on, because it shows that at least for me, that you can bridge across sectors and governance of a financial foundation for nature conservation often is conversations about things different to nature conservation. I think that's quite important, probably something I didn't expect. It's about people and it's about plans and objectives and scenarios.
Speaker 2: As well as the work in the field, so it's a really...
Speaker 3: Of course.
Speaker 2: Excellent learning all round and you were making a great contribution.
Speaker 3: Well, time will tell.
Speaker 2: Is there a grant or a project that you are particularly excited about?
Speaker 3: Yes, there is. In the context of this spending down strategy, we launched in, I think the conversation started in 2016 and maybe it was launched in 2017, the ISU, the Impact and Sustainability Unit and element of this well, least the motivation behind this was, obviously working with our partners to make them more resilient. One of the things that we noticed was a place where we could help, was in developing the next generation of nature conservation leaders. So within the Impact Sustainability Unit, we created, along with some partners, a program for leadership development and mentoring. Which basically consisted in taking a couple from each of our partner organizations, usually a junior and a senior, and where possible, a split gender group on a one year online journey through which they learned about development leadership, following a methodology called Leading Beyond Authority.
The idea behind that, or what we'd realized was that many of our partners, there was a lack of a second generation, or there was difficulty in finding out who would lead the organization forward through this transition. So this program's been very interesting. We've had now six cohorts, two weeks in person and the rest of the year is online. 170, maybe 180 people have gone through it from 26 different countries and so that's also helped us build a web of all of our partner organizations. What's been very, I think, enriching for the Mava network has been that it's created now, friendships between organizations that maybe knew of each other, but weren't close with each other. There's an understanding of a common challenge, which is not only about fundraising and about carrying out nature conservation activities in rural areas very often with strong economic pressures on the landscapes, but it's also an understanding that solutions could be found within the community.
I think there's something very powerful for the next period beyond the Mava foundation's existence, is that these ties will go on and they will hopefully be a very strong way in which the foundation has helped the conservation community in West Africa, the Mediterranean and the Alpine Arc beyond its existence.
Speaker 2: That's really special and I can imagine that for all the leaders involved and for the foundation, it's an invaluable network that will continue way beyond. Changing gears a little bit, what does the term family governance mean to you?
Speaker 3: It's a good question. I think there's a funny little contradiction in the idea of family governance I find personally, because the idea that governance is something that's quite formalized and family is something that's obviously not so formal. But I think maybe that's where I'll find my answer. I think the idea that in family governance, you do need to embrace the informal. It is challenging to professionalize relationships and one of the most important things I think, is recognizing that within a group of people that may know each other very well and most likely who grew up together, there can be diverse opinions and there can be diverse willingness to engage. I think that's probably the first challenge of family governance, is recognizing different appetites for engagement.
Speaker 2: Yes and for everyone to be able to engage or not, in the way that they would like to, in perhaps the business or foundation or other spaces, but also to continue to be embraced as a family member because they're still part of the family, but it doesn't mean you need to be part of any of the sort of governance mechanisms, as it were. What tips would you offer younger generations considering joining the board of their family foundation or any other governance forum?
Speaker 3:           Well actually, I'll think back to the question you asked me earlier on about joining the board and how that was at the beginning. I think the period of reflection was important, to sort of pour into the history and to learn about what's going on and to listen to the people who are already in place, try and understand their positions. But equally I think, not fearing to speak up is very important. If you're thinking about joining a governance of a foundation or another body within the family setting.
There's probably a reason why you'll want to get engaged and there's probably a reason why the people on the other side of the table will want you engaged. So don't be scared of using your voice and your perspective, chances are some of it's wrong. That's fine. So one thing that I learned is that people say things that are wrong all the time, but learning with humility and being able to trust oneself with one's question, I think is quite important. That's also, in my experience, how you can bring something to the table and the conversations get much more interesting when you know that you're there for a reason.
Speaker 2: Wise words. Absolutely wise words and with that, thank you so much Frederic for this wonderful conversation.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Two leaders of the UK’s non-profit community share three ways you might make a difference now.When prices rise—whether it’s for food, fuel, heating or equipment—the most vulnerable in our society suffer.
Today’s cost-of-living crisis puts additional pressure on often already-stretched charities and philanthropic initiatives, who are faced with rising costs and a more difficult fundraising landscape.
What might funders do to support charities and the social sector during this challenging period?
In this briefing note developed from conversations with Rosemary Macdonald, CEO of UK Community Foundations and James Banks, CEO of London Funders, we shed light on the obstacles that charities are currently facing and propose some practical approaches that philanthropists can consider for their existing giving arrangements, or new initiatives.
Keep communicating
First and foremost, healthy communication with the organisations you work with continues to be of utmost importance.
Implementing trust-based philanthropy reflects a commitment to building relationships between funders and organisations based on transparency, dialogue and mutual learning. Reach out to the organisations you support to understand the issues they are facing now, and what they anticipate becoming difficult in the future. Aim for open and honest conversations so organisations can share their concerns and help you to understand where increased funding might be most useful.
Listening to the communities you are working with is crucial; they are best placed to advise on the reality of what is working and where more is needed. Both Rosemary and James reminded us to be realistic about cuts to the services and the hard decisions that charities will have to face as they seek to continue operations in these conditions – many will have to stop delivering at the level they were, and at the calibre they were operating at. Open communication with the organisations you partner with will help you to support them through these challenges.
Be flexible
During the pandemic, there was a significant rise in unrestricted funding.
James feels that this has broadly led to healthier relationships between funders and fundees. We would encourage philanthropists to consider a meaningful unrestricted element in any new grants and it may also be worth considering decreasing the constraints you have on existing grants. Keep in mind that onerous reporting requirements and financial restrictions can put pressure on the core work of a charitable organisation.
As operating costs rise, communication with grantees about the impact inflation is having on their ability to carry out their work—particularly when multi-year grants are concerned – is important. Rising costs may be impacting organisations in ways you hadn’t considered – for example those that rely heavily on volunteers, or product donations, are likely to see reductions in both.
The impact of the cost-of-living crisis will be long-term, Rosemary notes, and so embedding flexibility in grants will be central to thoughtful grant-making going forward.
Take a long-term approach and have a willingness to learn
Tackling the most entrenched problems in our society and supporting our hardest-to-reach communities is far from simple and can require risk-taking and innovation. Rosemary highlighted that funders should also be considering investment into new ideas and directions, whether that’s encouraging research and development, or backing an ambitious pilot program. Furthermore, collaborating with others – again a trend that we saw during the pandemic – can create opportunities for funders to work together to innovate and create long term impact.
James reminded us that in this fire-fighting context we should also not lose sight of the ultimate goal of your giving—be that poverty reduction, improved educational outcomes or another focus. Innovation should be encouraged with an awareness for the ultimate aim of your philanthropy, and it is clear that both the pandemic and the current environment are exposing and exacerbating inequalities and injustices that already exist in our societies. It’s a good idea to go into conversations with grantees with an open mind and a willingness to learn. Listening to the communities that you wish to serve is vital.
We are here to help
Time, a willingness to learn, combined with financial means, can lead to a powerful philanthropic contribution.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Cybercriminals are waiting for you to drop your guard this holiday season. Take these actions to keep them at bay.With the upcoming holidays, many of us will be busy looking for that perfect gift. Hackers, scammers, and online thieves will be busy too, looking to take advantage of unsuspecting shoppers by searching for weaknesses in a device, internet connection, or attempting to capture personal and financial information through various social engineering methods or other attack vectors.
1
This is why it is essential as your year-end preparations move into high gear, you remain vigilant in your transactions and interactions. Here are some ways to protect yourself this holiday season:
Holiday shopping
As supply chain issues captured the world’s attention last year, shipping fraud increased nearly 800% worldwide in the past year
—
making it one of the biggest threats to consumers.
2
When shopping online, be certain to:
Stick with credit—
Use a credit card
—
rather than a debit card
—
for online purchases.
Do not hesitate—
Use secure mobile payment options, such as Apple Pay or Google Pay, to make quick and secure payments.
Click with care—
Don’t click on links in ads, unsolicited emails or pop-up windows. Instead, directly enter the URL of trusted shopping and financial websites into the address bar versus clicking on links from other sources.
Mind the URL—
Only buy from secure and reputable sites, who employ security features such as [https://|https:] and other measures. Log out of each website and close the browser window when you finish shopping. Never use the auto login or “remember me” feature on a site or your browser, to safeguard your information.
Gifts and giving
The holiday spirit—magnified by a desire to help others—increases people’s generosity, and fraudsters’ creativity:
Donate carefully—
Before you give, investigate to make sure
your donations will reach the causes you wish to support. In the U.S., for example,
Charity Navigator
the largest and most-utilized evaluator of charities publishes guidelines to help protect against online scams and ensure your donations are reaching a valid charity.
Also:
Always validate any new change in payment/donation instructions by calling the recipient on a known number, especially if a change is being made at the last minute.
Know your payee—
Always confirm you have an individual’s correct username/contact information before you send a payment via a mobile payment app. Funds sent to a wrong or fraudulent party are rarely recovered.
Safeguard gift cards—
Whether it’s a physical or e-gift card only purchase gift cards from reliable sources and make sure your passwords are complex and unique to each site where you shop. Scammers are using the same tactics they use to steal credit card information to steal gift card balances.
Also:
Never read gift card numbers to individuals who demand “payment for services” over the phone.
Holiday travel & video visits
However you plan to spend the holidays with family and friends this year, here are some things to consider:
Be safe when traveling and reserving vacation destinations—
Use trusted travel and vacation home rental services. Leverage the vendor’s secure messaging and payment tools to communicate and send payments. Don’t fall for deals that seem too good to be true. Research the property and the vendor before sending funds. Spoofed domains are an easy way for fraudsters to trick you into providing your personal information and even money.
Avoid public Wi-Fi—
Hot spots at hotels, airports, cafés and on planes are more likely to be compromised. If you have to use public Wi-Fi use a Virtual Private Network (VPN), which creates an encrypted connection between your mobile devices/computers and the sites you are trying to visit.
Secure videoconferences—
Password-protect
video chats with family and friends during the holidays (and year-round). When you’re not chatting or attending a video meeting, cover the camera/webcam lens to block unwanted views of your home/office.
Safeguard your privacy—
Don’t publicize upcoming travel plans or post trip/location updates on social media while you’re away. Create a social media agreement with your family and travel companions to ensure they do the same, especially with children and teenagers traveling with you.
Uninvited guests
Cyberattacks
—
phishing (fraudulent emails), smishing (text messages) and vishing (phone calls)
—
will multiply during the holidays as they have during the pandemic. Here’s what you can do:
Be wary—
Treat unsolicited emails, text messages, phone calls and social media posts with care. Even while conducting business, don’t assume information requested and/or provided is genuine. Never allow an unknown individual to remotely access your devices, even if they claim to be employed by a reputable company.
Get alerts—
Set up automated notifications on your financial accounts so you know whenever a transaction takes place. Regularly monitor your various financial accounts for suspicious activity.
Bolt the door—
Make sure each of your account passwords
—
whether to make purchases, transfer cash or hold videoconferences
—
is complex and unique. Also, enable multi-factor authentication for financial, social media, shopping and other sites whenever possible. Consider using a password manager to keep track of your online accounts.
Remember this!

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.In preparing for your family’s future, these five questions may help identify areas of focus in leading your family office’s strategy.The success of a family office depends on its ability to navigate both the tangible and intangible challenges of sustaining family wealth, in concert with the family’s long-term goals. In preparing for the family’s future, the following questions may help identify areas of focus in leading your family office’s strategy
Consideration #1 – Does your family office have a ""North Star""?
It’s common for family offices to focus on tax, legal and investment considerations. Taking a step back, however, it's important to remember that a family office essentially exists to execute the family’s decision-making, strategy and priorities, and if the family’s long-term purpose and priorities are not clarified, then the family office doesn’t have sufficient direction to act on the family’s behalf, and to anticipate both opportunities and challenges.
Additionally, if the family office is established to serve multiple family members (e.g., siblings or more than one generation) these issues can become more acute. For example, if serving many family members, they may have different attitudes to risk and have different goals for their wealth. Some may consider preservation as their main goal, while others may aim aggressive growth, and still others may need the investment portfolio to generate an income to support their lifestyle. Also, even if there is one principal decision maker – what might happen if he/she were incapacitated?
For this reason, families and their offices benefit from a long-term North Star to navigate towards – these core principles help the family to set governing policies on the investment and use of these resources, and well as the corresponding practice of communication and decision-making.
Useful points for family decision-makers to clarify include:
What is the family’s vision and purpose for their wealth?
What is their strategy to preserve and grow their wealth over generations?
What is the purpose of the family office (FO)?
What services does the family want and not want it to provide (both currently and potentially in the future)?
The goals-based framework in approaching this consideration and their answers to these questions can help define a common framework for both the family and family office to both guide decision-making and enhance accountability.
Consideration #2 – Do you have the requisite EQ as well as IQ to lead your FO?
Often the expertise of family officers lies in the important foundation of investment, tax, and legal professions.  However, every family has assets and liabilities beyond the financial type. From a sustainable wealth standpoint, the most important non-financial asset of a family remains their human capital, or the individual family members themselves, their talents, capabilities, overall health and well-being –once this is compromised, then the family can suffer as a whole.
In addition to the human capital, a family also has intellectual capital, i.e., the collective knowledge of a family through formal education and practical experience.
The third form of additional capital constitutes the family’s own network, reputation, community standing, and connections, and this social capital has become a very important asset to maintain, especially given the speed of social media.
While not part of the formal job description, helping to cultivate and educate the next generation has become a widely expected component of a family office's role, and introducing resources and peer cohorts to advance their development has arisen as a priority.
Consideration #3 – How do you help mitigate a family's internal challenges as well as external risks?
When considering risks, many family offices focus on the more tangible financial risks – from volatile markets and excessive leverage, to unforeseen tax consequences. However, when it comes to multi-generational family wealth, internal and less tangible risks can be as important more easily overlooked, more specifically:
Disruption
due to death, incapacity or divorce arises as one common form of internal risk.  Disruption can also result from the sale of a business, even if it creates a windfall for the family.
Dissent
within the family, whether spoken or unspoken, arises as another internal challenge, whether or not litigation results. A common seed of dissent often comes from a sense of unfairness, which a lack of communication can aggravate.
Dissipation
constitutes a third form of internal risk – the gradual loss of wealth from spending more than what the assets can sustain over time and for many descendants. Dissipation can also result from the geographic dispersion of family members, and a lack of connectivity and unity for a family to work together.
Identifying these risks proactively can help the family office plan and mitigate them proactively.
Consideration #4 – How can you optimally manage the nuts and bolts of family operations?
Efficient operations depend on the optimal leverage of both internal staff and external providers.  Regardless of the size of your office and AUM, when you’re deciding what to outsource, we recommend that you keep in mind the following:
First, assess the most labor-intensive tasks
and an alternate use of time that can elevate the strategic role of the family office.
Second, outsource
functions that require
professional specialization & certification
, e.g., legal and accounting. But as with any form of advice, it’s important to
right-size the task with the provider
. For instance, one family office uses a major law firm only for high-profile complex projects, and uses a sole practitioner for more routine work, so even within in a certain discipline, you may have a portfolio of providers to manage the costs.
Third, where it benefits to gain collective intelligence
from other families, it may help to use a provider that works with multiple wealthy families This is especially helpful in areas such as strategic philanthropy planning, and educating younger generations on how to become effective stewards of the family wealth.
Consideration #5 – How have you embraced technology in your family office?
Complexity and levels of documentation required continue to grow, with tax compliance in multiple jurisdictions.  These functions can both remain time intensive and a risk if a key person leaves.  In planning a path forward, consider:
Strategy
: The priorities and corresponding strategy of your family office, and what data requirements these generate
Streamline
: Consider platforms or solutions available to streamline data management, e.g. tax planning and compliance, investment dashboards, financial reports, bill paying.
Security
: High profile families and their family offices remain perennial targets for fraudsters. In one survey, 55% of future technology investments focus on cybersecurity.*
A family office well-placed for success helps the family implement their vision, purpose and objectives, and adapt to their changing needs and circumstances. In supporting this important role, we work with family offices globally, with both the challenges and strategies needed to steward the family's wealth successfully across generations.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Harnessing your social, intellectual and human capital—in addition to your financial resources—can help you make a meaningful impact.Defining your philanthropic legacy can sometimes feel intimidating and out of reach, especially given the common misconception that the measurement for charitable impact is the dollar amount of your financial gift. In reality, there are many approachable and fulfilling ways to leave a lasting legacy and experience the true joy and fellowship of giving.
What exactly does it take to create a philanthropic legacy?
The key is to take a holistic approach that taps into your unique relationships, passions, interests and resources. Writing a check is important, but that’s not the only lever to pull to leave your philanthropic mark. Harness your intellectual, human and social capital—as well as your financial capital— to make a meaningful difference in the lives of others. Here’s how.
Donate intellectual and human capital
Donating your skills, experience and time can be a powerful way to support the causes you care about most.
For example, do you have skills honed at work? Fluency in multiple languages? Specialist knowledge developed through hobbies? Athletic abilities that could be shared through coaching?
You will maximize your impact by thinking broadly about what you can contribute to the organizations that align best with your values.
Giving back in action: Contributing time and expertise to inspire change
One family’s support of a nonprofit organization grew out of the father’s desire to empower local youth. Drawing on his experience as a corporate lawyer, the father volunteered to serve as a member of the organization’s board of directors and as an informal legal advisor.
Over time, the father’s two children were moved to help with the group’s mission to strengthen underserved youth’s leadership skills through soccer. Now, on game days, the whole family turns out to help set up the field, shag balls during play and clean up afterward.
Multiplying the father’s initial impact even further, he involved employees at his law firm in the nonprofit’s activities—both as donors and volunteers.
In the end, one person’s motivation to give back inspired action in many others, creating a rewarding and unforgettable experience for everyone involved.
Donate social capital
One of the best ways to scale your philanthropic impact is by collaborating with others.
As an example: Join or form a “giving circle” to pool charitable resources with friends, family, neighbors and colleagues. Giving circles attract members who are excited to work together to support causes under a unifying theme. For instance, together you might focus on a given population, such as women and girls; a place, whether a nearby neighborhood or far-off locale; or a pervasive issue, such as racial inequity.
The benefits to membership, beyond maximizing the financial contribution of a single donor, include:
1
Learning more about issue areas you care about
Refining giving best practices alongside peers
Expanding and diversifying your personal networks
Currently, there are more than 2,000 giving circles
2
in the United States and the number is growing, as the enthusiasm for collective impact appeals to all levels of donors.
Giving back in action: Joining together to magnify results
A number of “next gen giving circles” across the country aim to engage younger philanthropists. For a group of 20-to-30-year-olds living in the same city, a giving circle was a way to learn grantmaking best practices and identify grassroots organizations that align with the group’s social justice mission.
The ultimate aim is to pool funds that can make a difference while making philanthropy accessible to early-career donors. Before the giving circle makes a donation, members research nonprofit organizations, discuss them as a group, and learn from each other’s questions and lived experiences. Then, they reach a consensus on which organizations to support, the funding amount and the timeframe, either over one year or many.
The grantmaking process is collaborative, engaging and ideally fun!
Donate financial capital
Individual donors are incredibly important to an effective and sustainable nonprofit sector, accounting for two-thirds of annual donations made to charitable organizations.
3
Yet even experienced donors can feel unsure or apprehensive when considering a financial gift to an organization that is new to them.
Perhaps you are drawn to support the mission of an organization mentioned in your social media or suggested by a friend. For an organization you don’t know well, take the time to develop a personal connection to feel confident in your giving:
Learn about the organization through publicly available means: annual report on website, nonprofit database Guidestar and news coverage; meet board members; volunteer and attend events; and tap your network to uncover personal experiences with the charity’s mission.
Use a first donation to get to know an organization; consider increasing your donations as the relationship deepens.
If you aren’t sure how much to give, open a dialogue: Ask the organization about its top funding needs; about what individual donors give, on average. Or ask outright: “What do donors like me give?”
Is a deep personal connection with a nonprofit organization required for every single financial gift? The answer is “no.” But don’t hesitate to invest the effort if you want to diversify and broaden your giving.
Giving back in action: Cultivating family values and traditions
Many families engage in philanthropy to actively share their values and inspire the next generation’s lifelong giving.
For one family, philanthropy became a holiday tradition.
Every year, the parents asked each of their three children to identify a charity they wanted to support. The children eagerly presented their research and recommendations to their parents. This provided an opportunity for the family to talk about the importance of helping others and to learn about the issues each child cared deeply about.
Demonstrating it’s never too early to start creating your philanthropic legacy, the children, aged 9, 11 and 15, were given $50 each to donate. The parents plan to incrementally increase the dollar amount over time and offer bonus funds as the children participate in volunteer activities.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Your collection, handled well, can provide financial flexibility, serve your larger wealth plan and help you create a lasting legacy.Agnes Le Ster, Managing Director for J.P. Morgan Private Bank
Charlotte Eyerman, Executive Director and Chief Art Curator for J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.
Sarah Collins, Executive Director for J.P. Morgan Private BankArt, and the passion for it, can help sustain us, especially during difficult times. You know this well if you are a serious collector. Perhaps the pandemic-related lockdowns gave you more time with some of your favorite pieces. Perhaps you participated in the innovative global auctions held online by Christie’s, Sotheby’s, Phillips, Artcurial and the other auction houses as the art market accelerated its adoption of the megatrend digitization. Or perhaps you’ve returned to in-person gallery visits.
Your private art collection also has value as a powerful financial asset. The question is: How might you best use and build this unique asset, particularly in these volatile times?
Precise answers are obviously idiosyncratic to each collector and depend on many factors, including home country and goals. Still, it is helpful to be aware of evergreen issues and some practices your peers successfully employ. So here is a quick tour of a few key questions—with answers that may help you decide what could work for you.
How do you own the art?
Owning each piece directly in your name, solely or jointly with your spouse, can be a great way to start. As a private art collection develops, owners often establish an intervening legal entity to hold title to their artwork. Doing so can give you a dynamic, consolidated view of your collection, allow centralized art collection management and mean that only one country’s laws may apply to the lot. It also can help you keep your collection together for future generations. Additional benefits depend on which country’s laws you’re operating under and which type of entity you’ve chosen.
In so-called “civil law countries” such as France and Mexico,
1
the legal entities that collectors most often employ to invest in artwork are corporations or foundations (especially if you want to establish a legacy with this collection). Prime benefits of this approach to art collection management include assistance in organizing, insuring and hiring professionals to care for a collection. There also may be cross-border advantages, such as protection from taxes outside your home country. For example, say that you’re a Mexican national with a painting hanging in a second home in California. If your Mexican company owns the piece, it’s likely that no U.S. capital taxes would be due if you sold the piece to a dealer in Malibu. In addition, the Mexican company can protect against U.S. transfer taxes if you decide to gift the artwork to a family member in the next generation.
In the United States, a “common law country,” the legal entities of choice for art ownership are typically trusts or limited liability companies (LLCs). These entities also can help you organize and transfer your collection. Additional benefits for U.S. taxpayers who put their collections in a trust or have an LLC own the pieces include privacy and protection against personal liability.
Many U.S. owners want to keep the public and press from knowing the size, nature, value or extent of their holdings. Fortunately for them, art ownership is not typically part of the public record.
However, if you want your identity as an owner from being inadvertently disclosed or easily discovered, you’ll want to be sure to acquire your art, pay for expenses associated with it, and even borrow against it through a generically named revocable trust or limited liability company (e.g
.
, “25 Elm Street Trust” or “25 Elm Street LLC”). To the extent the public and press can access information about an artwork’s owner, they might learn only the name of the trustee you selected (your attorney, perhaps) or the name of the LLC. (For the record: Anonymity is not gained by owning art in a “civil law” country’s private company.)
An LLC also puts a layer of protection between you and potential litigation in the United States. That protection runs in two directions. If a claim unrelated to your art is successful, the most a creditor might receive is an interest in the LLC that owns your artwork; the creditor cannot compel the art’s sale. Conversely, if the LLC is sued (e.g., for breach of a lease agreement involving the art), your personal assets would generally not be available to satisfy the claim.
The digitization of art
All of the planning described above has worked very well for traditional art collections (i.e., paintings, sculptures and other tangible artwork). But what about non-tangible art? The latest trend in the world of art is the creation and sale of NFTs, or non-fungible tokens. NFTs are digital assets and can represent works of art, music, images, writings and videos. NFTs are bought and sold entirely online using block chain technology, just like cryptocurrencies.
NFTs of digital art experienced a huge boom during the pandemic. For more on how NFTs disrupted the contemporary art market, please read here
What are NFTs? Decoding non-fungible tokens
. The NFT art market so far has been extremely volatile, and it doesn’t have the same market history and track record as traditional artworks. Nevertheless, if you are interested in acquiring NFTs, you should consider these three succession planning questions: If something happened to you, who would know about your NFT collection? How would your intended beneficiaries access these assets? How can you legally transfer ownership to your beneficiaries?
As a first step, make a list of your NFT collection. In a secure place, keep a record of each NFT, the digital location (i.e., the digital wallet where the NFT is stored) and the information needed to gain access to the NFT, such as usernames and passwords. Let at least one trusted person know how to access your inventory. Second, make sure your legal documents address your digital assets and give your executor proper access. Consult your lawyer about the language that should be included in your testament or trust to ensure that your beneficiaries will receive your NFTs.
How can your art increase your financial flexibility?
Thoughtful borrowing can support your goals in building your art collection. It also can help you keep your investments on track, which can be especially helpful during volatile times.
Collectors often benefit from lines of credit to help build and maintain their collections. In many cases, having ready access to liquidity allows collectors to move quickly to acquire important pieces newly introduced to the market through the settlement of an estate or from other unexpected events such as divorce. Of course, not every collector has sufficient cash on hand to acquire a masterwork that is suddenly available. For this reason, many collectors have lines of credit available, often secured by their existing art collections, to allow them to bridge the purchase of the art to future liquidity events—or perhaps even maintain prudent leverage against the collections over many years as the collections appreciate in value.  Access to liquidity through a line of credit is an essential tool for serious collectors, and working with sophisticated lenders allows them to avail themselves of a range of options.
Collectors also benefit from having art-secured lines of credit in that they are not restricted to using loan proceeds solely to acquire art. They can also use their lines to fund unexpected outflows without having to liquidate investments or other assets, and perhaps prematurely triggering capital gains taxes. Collectors can draw on their lines of credit to pay for unexpected or sizeable outflows, or even use their art collateral to fund investments to help diversify and grow their personal balance sheets. If structured correctly, borrowers would also benefit from the investment interest deduction to offset investment income, as long as proceeds from the art-secured loan are used for investment purposes.
How does your art fit into your financial picture?
Art is an unusual asset for many reasons, including the owner’s emotional attachment to it, artwork’s inherently illiquid nature—and its relative stability over the long term. Nevertheless, if you are acquiring art for significant prices, it is an asset. Some of our clients do see art investment as a way to diversify their portfolios. But even if you never view your holdings through this lens, we strongly recommend that you carefully evaluate your holdings in the context of your lifetime financial goals as well as your estate planning.
One of the many advantages of you working with J.P. Morgan is that, because art lending is one of our strengths, we have longstanding relationships with some of the world’s leading collectors, and we have built a breath of knowledge over the decades working with our clients and as one of the oldest and largest corporate art collectors in the world. Your J.P. Morgan team can work together—and with our specialists across the world—to help you and your professional advisors make sure your art holdings help you achieve your goals, wherever you and your art may live.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.You’ve devoted a lot of time and energy to collecting cars – but have you done enough to safeguard your wealth and privacy?Andrew Goldberg, Head of Passions and Pursuits Advisory
Adam Clark, Global Head of Trusts & Estates
At J.P. Morgan Private Bank, we work to help you experience the full spectrum of what your wealth can create. Of course, your wealth does not define you, even as it can help you achieve your unique ambitions and passions. Be intentional. Make sure that your particular passions are an integral part of your holistic wealth plan.
Collectors are generally known for their passionate enthusiasm—whether they’re acquiring Picasso lithographs or rare first edition books. Among the most fervent of collector groups are auto collectors. A recent testimony to that passion: the Museum of Modern Art exhibit, Automania, which features nine cars along with posters, paintings and sculpture celebrating the genre. As the museum explains, the exhibit “invites visitors to take an up-close view of the machines that architect Le Corbusier compared to ancient Greek temples.”
If you are one such enthusiast, you are not alone. Experts estimate the value of the global classic car market exceeded $30 billion in 2020. The U.S. market is itself expected to grow to $15.5 billion by 2023
1
. But while enthusiasm for cars is well understood, how a car collection can fit into a larger wealth picture may be more opaque.
At J.P. Morgan Private Bank, we encourage you to be intentional about your plan, and we are ready to help you make the most of your passion. Here are some of the key considerations for your treasured collection:
Protect your wealth and privacy with an LLC
Set aside funds to maintain the collection
Prepare an exit strategy: Consider establishing a trust or foundation
Consider an LLC to protect your wealth and privacy
A large collection can attract attention—some wanted, some less so. In a world of social media and cybersecurity risks, owning your collection in an LLC structure can make a lot of sense.
If you are a collector who buys vintage cars in your own name, that information is more than likely publicly discoverable. What you bought and when, as well as the prices you paid—all are exposed to whomever takes the time to look. In contrast, if you buy your cars through an entity such as an LLC that does not bear your name, you can maintain discretion and privacy.
An LLC structure can also help protect you in the event of an accident. Imagine this scenario. A collector decides, for charity, to auction off to the highest bidder the opportunity to get behind the wheel of a vintage car that he owns in his own name. During the brief drive an accident occurs, resulting in damage and injuries. The owner of the car collection could be held personally liable for all damages and uncovered medical expenses, leaving the collection and other assets exposed.
Set aside funds to maintain the collection
Some collectors view their collections as part of their legacies, and wish them to remain intact even when they are no longer around to enjoy them. But collections are often liquidated or dismantled for one of two reasons: to pay tax when the collections are passed to heirs, or when it proves too costly to properly maintain the fleet. Using a multi-generational vehicle such as a trust may reduce the tax burden, and also allow you to put money aside for general maintenance, insurance and storage of your vehicles. Perhaps the car collection is housed in a barn. You may want money for future capital improvements to the structure—during and potentially beyond your own lifetime.
Establish an exit strategy or succession plan
An important generational shift is underway. It’s likely to result in the largest transfer of assets in history, and the car market is not immune. It is estimated that baby boomers own 60% of the collectible market, but millennials are now the more active buyers.
As this shift continues, it is important to be thoughtful and intentional about your collection’s future. Might you one day want to sell your collection? And what should be done after you pass? Do you want the collection to remain intact? Or would you prefer that your heirs decide which cars to sell or keep? Whatever you decide, you want to be sure your wishes will be honored.
Say that you’ve determined to place your car collection in some kind of a structure. You can choose a foundation or trust. Here are two case studies of collectors who made different choices:
Private Operating Foundation
U.S. collector John owned an extensive collection of 40 iconic cars valued at $50 million. He opted to set up a private operating foundation, which then owned the cars. About $10 million in liquid assets was earmarked for collection maintenance. John wanted to be sure that his vehicles could be displayed at various car shows around the world, and the private foundation helped make that possible.
His financial and estate advisors explained that an operating foundation must satisfy certain conditions, but once satisfied the tax benefits are simple. The operating foundation is federally tax exempt, so John could make gifts to the foundation and pay no gift tax and also receive an income tax deduction. If the assets of the operating foundation generated income, only a modest excise tax applies. And when John died, there would be no estate tax to be paid on the foundation’s assets. All in all, on his $60m foundation, John reduced his gift and estate tax liability by $24m.
Trusts and LLCs
Collector Joan opted to have an LLC own the cars, and she put the LLC shares equally into trusts benefiting her children. A trustee provided management and oversight of the LLC and vehicles. Like John, Joan placed $10 million in liquid assets in the LLC to generate income to cover vehicle expenses. When she gifted the LLC shares to the trusts, she retained some control over the management of the cars. This reduced the value of the gift, enabling Joan to make a meaningful reduction in her gift and estate tax liability.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Exploring the past, together, can help you build a better future your family.Do your children know all four of your parents’ names and where they were born? The personal qualities they were best known for? Do you know your parents’ worst setbacks—and how they overcame them?
Sharing family history can be grounding, inspiring and good for family harmony. Holiday gatherings can be the ideal time to dive in. And while there is no one right way to explore your collective history, we can offer a number of suggestions.
Why it’s important
While researching your genealogy is helpful, the accompanying stories may deepen your family’s appreciation of the experiences that forged your forebears’ characters, and the values still evident today.
For wealthy families in particular, including time for family history can be a fun, meaningful way to frame an annual family business meeting. The conversation can hone communication skills that are helpful when it’s time to make decisions together about assets.
A family history project can offer a family going through a liquidity event (e.g., selling a business) time to reflect on the values, qualities and decisions that created their financial success—recalling the past before starting a new chapter.
For new generations, sharing family history can foster a connection to the source of their wealth. They may never have heard about their predecessors’ struggles, or the labor involved in creating wealth. It can teach the lesson that wealth is not guaranteed to last and motivate the young to emulate values that contribute to continuing success.
As one patriarch said: “I want future generations to understand that we didn’t just wake up one day and find a pile of money on our doorstep. My hope is that they will appreciate their favorable financial situation more if they understand how we got here.”
How to share
So how might you go about getting the family to explore its past?
Here’s one approach: Have a simple discussion. A family member interested in genealogy could kick off the conversation. Perhaps pair this family historian with a younger person who is naturally inquisitive. (Or pair relatives who feel attuned to one another.)
Involving younger children in collecting information on the prior generations’ journeys can help inspire pride in the family’s achievements.
You could hire a writer to help. However, before contracting out, consider that an important element of the exercise is the opportunity to talk with each other.
Interviews can be done, one-on-one, with the results presented to the group. Include lesser-known relatives for different perspectives. (Sending questions in advance gives people time to prepare.) If interviewing at a large gathering, ask a question, allow time for listening to the answer, and then let others share their reactions.
Contradictory memories can enrich a family’s discussion.
In one family, a matriarch was a formidable character experienced differently by her granddaughters. One remembered being intimidated by her. Another admired her grandmother and had strong memories of being taken to the theater. Their conversation helped the adult granddaughters see what they did and didn’t want to keep: the learning, not the fear.
Additional techniques
Other ways to explore your common past include:
Starting with a family artifact.
Props can spur conversations. One family held up a cooking pot passed down by their grandmother used to heat milk for coffee. It led her descendants to remember how nurturing she was.
Using old family photos.
Ask: Who around the table knows who these people are? What can you tell us about them? Remember their funny aspects, the texture of their relationships. Record the conversation: The journey of discovery could result in a film, slideshow or coffee table book.
Taking a heritage trip.
One wealthy family traveled to the site of their grandparents’ humble beginnings in Ireland. Traveling can deepen everyone’s appreciation of how far their family has come.
Gathering stories from characters who aren’t usually in the limelight.
Don’t stop with the biggest personality or the most successful. Did a spouse make sacrifices? What costs of success were endured along the way? And the stories don’t have to be new—retell old favorites, too.
Just as importantly, explore past challenges—failures and adversity, not just triumphs. How did living through terrible times feel? When family history is preserved, it can serve as a guide and moral compass. Perhaps the biggest message to the young may be that family history is unfinished. The next chapter is theirs to write.

Global Fraud Awareness Team
Amy Zeng,
Global Fraud Awareness Team
We all know that fraud is a danger and individuals can lose their hard-earned money to criminals.
The question is:
What can each of us do to protect ourselves?
The first step, of course, is becoming aware of how big the threat has grown. Victims of impersonation scams alone lost more than $4.1 billion in 2021. And older people are disproportionately targeted: There were 92,000 complaints reported by victims over the age of 60—with losses estimated at more than $1.6 billion. As many victims in this population do not report fraud, it’s suspected the numbers are significantly higher.
1
It’s also vital for us to learn how to spot fraudsters and scams when they show up in our lives. It isn’t always obvious.
Hearing real-life examples of common scenarios can help hone our instincts. So here are the stories of how George and Shannon fell victim to common imposter scams, the red flags they missed, and the countermeasures you can take to stop these misfortunes from happening to you. Getting into a few habits can help keep fraudsters at bay.
George’s story
George,
*
now in his 70s, has always taken pride in handling the accounts for his family. Recently, he received a phone call from a person claiming to be a representative from his financial institution.
The caller said George’s assets were at risk of being stolen by fraudsters. To protect him, the caller said, a “safe banking account” had been opened for his use. George was instructed to liquidate his current accounts and send those assets to the “secure” account as quickly as possible.
Concerned, George began the process of withdrawing and transferring funds.
Over the next 20 days, this scam artist remained engaged with George while he initiated 20 transactions of various amounts with the goal of moving his entire life savings into the banking account provided by the caller.
The continuous activity in George’s account raised a red flag at his bank. George’s client service team repeatedly questioned him about these transactions, but George kept saying only that, yes, he intended for these to happen. Only when George’s banker contacted him did George finally share why he was making so many transactions. By that time, about a quarter of the funds he had placed in the external account already had been withdrawn by the fraudster.
How could George have known earlier that he was being defrauded?
The red flags George missed and the actions we all should take when confronted with a similar scenario are simple:
Red flag
—George did not know the caller and had no proof that the person represented his financial institution.
How to prevent fraud
—If anyone calls claiming to be from your bank, ask for more information and be wary of anyone who hesitates, is reluctant or unable to provide identifying information. Also, to verify the legitimacy of any caller, call your financial institution directly on a number you know belongs to it. (To find the number, look at your last statement or on the back of your credit card.)
Red flag
—Fraudsters often claim there is a crisis and your urgent action is needed.
How to prevent fraud
—Always take the time you need to verify that each recommended step is actually in your best interest. Before taking action, contact your banking team for more information. Also, consider enabling account alerts to receive notification of account activity.
Red flag
—The fraudster set up an account for George and asked him to transfer money into it.
How to prevent fraud
—Always be wary when asked to send funds to a specific account, or a “safe account.” Never assume a caller or the information they share is genuine. Contact your financial institution if you have concerns about your account.
Shannon’s story
Shannon,
*
35, thought she was protecting herself—and she was, to some extent: She took the excellent step of enrolling to receive communications about her accounts’ activity with her bank.
One day, she received a text asking for confirmation of a money movement transaction to a third party. She replied to the message saying that the transaction was not legitimate.
Shortly after, she received a call from an individual claiming to be from her bank. This person said that in order to reverse this fraudulent transaction, Shannon would need to send a mobile payment for the same amount to her husband, who was a joint account holder, using his phone number. The fraudster claimed that, in this way, Shannon would be sending the funds back to herself.
What Shannon didn’t know was that the fraudster used her husband’s phone number to create a new mobile payment account at a different bank. Therefore, when Shannon sent the money to her husband’s phone number, it was redirected to the fraudster’s account.
What could Shannon have done differently?
Shannon was busy with her daily life, and thought she didn’t have the time to dig into any details of a transaction she thought she’d already told her bank was fraudulent. But failing to check twice, she wound up paying a steep price in time, money and aggravation.
Red flag
—Shannon did not know the sender of the text message. She also did not know the caller who claimed to be from her bank.
How to prevent fraud
—Never assume texts, calls or emails are from whom they claim to be from. Fraudsters can spoof or mimic legitimate organizations’ contact details. Always verify by independently contacting your financial institution.
Red flag
—Shannon didn’t review payment details before sending the funds.
How to prevent fraud
—When sending a payment digitally, some payment platforms will ask you to verify the account name at the beneficiary bank. In this case, Shannon received a warning that the name she entered (her husband’s name) did not match the name at the beneficiary bank. Taking a few seconds to review all of the details on the screen would have prevented her loss.
Red flag
—The so-called banker asked her to send funds from her account.
How to prevent fraud—
Read all notifications carefully before making any digital payments. Check that numbers of accounts on payments are correct and known. And always call your financial institution if you have any questions. Digital payments are like giving cash and cannot be reversed; you have to rely on the recipient to return the funds. Also, periodically review your account for suspicious activity. If an individual claims there is an issue with your account, contact your bank directly for more information.
Adopt a few crime-fighting habits
You can protect yourself from fraud by adopting a few new habits:
Be wary when sharing personal information, even during the course of business. Don’t assume a request is genuine or that information provided to you is real.
Never trust the caller ID of a phone call or text message—caller ID can also be spoofed (the name can be changed to make the call seem more legitimate).
Avoid answering calls from unknown numbers. Instead, allow such calls to go to voicemail. If the call is important, the caller will leave a message.
Never provide personal information such as PINs, passwords or one-time passcodes.
Use mobile payment apps only with people you know, and always confirm you have the correct username or contact information before you hit send. Funds sent to a wrong party rarely can be recovered.
We’re by your side

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Carol Mushriqui, Senior Wealth Advisor
One of the biggest contributors to the success of a family business is the ability to continue to innovate throughout generations in order to keep up with a rapidly changing environment. This approach requires considerable agility, creativity and a relentless tenacity – what some would call an entrepreneurial spirit.
One of the key questions we often hear from business founders is how can they pass down that entrepreneurial spirit to their children to ensure the longevity of their business as well as their wealth for generations to come.
While there is no secret recipe for ensuring multi-generational entrepreneurship, we believe there are a number of ways to nurture and encourage the ability to be creative and innovative in the next generation.
1.  Recognise the change in perspectives
It is important to recognise the shifting perspectives from the founding generation to the next generation. Founders typically have strived to create something out of nothing, taking on bigger risks in order to build something of value, and create significant wealth, perhaps for the first time. Their focus and energy is often on wealth creation.
Meanwhile, their children may feel a sense of expectation to perform, succeed and maintain the wealth that has been created, as well as the pressure to find their own path and achieve their own dreams. Often they ask the following questions:
How will I live up to my parents’ expectations?
What is my purpose, outside of the wealth my parents created?
What value do I bring to a business that was already a success without me?
First, we must recognise the change in perspectives and attitudes from one generation to the other, and not assume that the next generation will carry the same attitude towards wealth as their parents.
2.  Redefine success
Many will recognise the well-known statistic that 30% of family businesses will survive to the second generation, 13% to the third generation, and only 3% of family businesses will survive beyond that. But what if survival does not necessarily equate to success? What if success means much more than simply handing the baton down from generation to generation? Isn’t it possible that the sale of a family business as a way to harvest value and create new opportunities for family members can be seen as a huge success?
In our conversations with business families, we often encourage and facilitate a discussion on redefining success and identifying what that means to your family in particular. Is it the continuation of the family business, or might it include your daughter’s success in a new venture or your son’s success in managing the family office and diversifying the family’s assets? Could success also include enhancing family communication and strengthening relationships, or finding better ways to execute decisions as a family?
Whatever success means to you and your family, it will be important to the next generation in particular to think holistically about success, as this gives them the opportunity and permission to think creatively about how best to use their talents and resources.
Often, some families find it helpful to have a facilitator guiding these discussions about what success looks like for you and your family, and articulating your vision and values, both individually and collectively.
3.  Reduce the obstacles in the way of entrepreneurship
Often one of the biggest obstacles to entrepreneurship in the next generation is the fear of failure. Some of the methods that families use to overcome this fear can include:
Creating an internal family venture fund.
Setting aside funds for the specific purpose of supporting family members in their new business ventures often gives the next generation the license to take the plunge and put their ideas into action. It can be a good way to show the next generation that they have the support and resources they need to think creatively.
Support through external mentorship.
Partnering with a mentor from outside the family can often be a good way to give the next generation fresh insights and the objectivity that they need, without the heightened expectations (or sometimes judgement) that can often come from family members.
Starting a family forum for sharing ideas.
Many families have found that brainstorming with family members has offered unique wisdom and insights based on a rich history of experiences. Starting a forum for sharing ideas across generations can offer a helpful sounding board for younger family members embarking on an entrepreneurial venture for the first time, as well as giving the seasoned entrepreneur some food for thought.
Embrace failure as a part of the learning journey.
It is sometimes said that overnight success takes a long time. The key lessons to be learnt on the road to success are often those that only failure can teach. Part of encouraging entrepreneurship is embracing failure, as an unavoidable part of success. So share stories of failure, as well as stories of success. Pass them down from generation to generation and don’t be tempted to downplay the failures of the past. These are key conversations to have with the next generation to help them overcome that fear of failure.

Basma: Thank you very much, Maya for this introduction. And I'm really happy to be part of the podcast of JB Morgan. It's an honor for me to be honest, to share all of the knowledge and all of the experience that we have with everybody.
Maya: Thank you. So let's start Basma, perhaps, if you could tell us a little bit more about your family and how and why you became involved in the family business.
Basma: Sure. We can talk at the beginning about the family maybe. And I think it will be nice to talk about the family background. We're large family and having a large family, this expresses a lot of things that we are doing now. I'm considered a third generation. My grandfather, he had 12 sons and five [inaudible 00:03:34] filters. And now as a third generation, we are handling a lot of executive roles in the company. So I think it's now it's a most important duration for family business, the third generation handing these important roles we can say. This where the family office and all of what we are working on have been shining in the past couple of years. First of all, talking about Basma and Zamil, it was a challenge to be honest. When I graduated from university, it was a dream for me to be working even with the family.
I used to go with my father to the office. When I turned eight years old, that's a time when my father said to me, ""Okay, so today you can't come back to the office"". And it was like a shocking moment for me. I had this small office with my father, however, all that, it was like a dream and went back, went to the States, have all my studies and came back to Saudi. And surprisingly, my father said to me, ""Okay, you can come back and join the company"". At the beginning I was, to be honest, I was not sure about it. However, no, that was real. The first year I was working from home and I accepted and it was for me better than nothing. After one year when they saw the seriousness and everybody noticed that they have allocated an office for me and Alhamdulillah, from there this is my 10th year with Zamil Group.
It went really fast. Through all of these years it was really ups and downs. However, working with the family, I think it's something that it's an important, however, it's not easy, but yeah, it's not easy to be working with your uncles and cousins. However, I think it's a challenge that everybody has to go to be strong enough, to continue on working in it. My first task and fortunately was to employ females. And it was a very nice experience. I have employed females in couple of companies, going through all the logistics of it. Especially that it was the first years of allowing the women to work in Saudi. So it was really a challenge to allocate a place for them, even to let the employees accept that there are females with them in the company. All of these challenges really was something not easy at all.
However, it was a nice journey. It was a successful journey. Thanks to God. And from there, I think everything went smooth. One more thing that I want to add is for me today. I think it's, I'm now looking at it as something nice that I allow all the female cousins to have, I can say an eye opening that, ""Okay, we can one day join the company"". I'm happy that couple of cousins have joined, female cousins. And as of today, we are five female cousins and we have internship female cousins too, who are joining the company. So I think these days it's really important to have all of these opportunities out there for the females to be really challenging. This is briefly about all of the last 10 years that I have been going through Maya.
Maya: But you are a tremendous role model in the wider community, but also for your cousins and inspired them I'm sure, to join. And also through your presence, the work you've done, you've built your credibility and earned your credibility in the company, working with your uncles and other employees in the business as well. And through that, you've really brought about change without having any authority. I wonder if you could just reflect for a moment on how you influence change without any confrontation or conflict.
Basma: To be honest, Maya, I remember, I don't know if I can say this or no, but there were some days that I was in the office and crying, really crying because I don't know, I was like, ""Okay, what I'm doing. What I'm doing, is it right? Is it wrong? Shall I leave the office? Should I know, stay in the office and really work with whatever circumstances around me"". So there were really couple of days that were very hard to be honest. I can say that my uncles hold my hand from the first day, and this was really the support that I had. Our culture, I can say, we don't have this very clear communication. However, I can see it in their eyes. I can see it between their sentences. I can see their support, but without saying it, and this is really what made me to continue what I have begin and what I'm doing and what I'm working on.
They were giving me the authority indirectly. So I was like, ""Okay, do I have the authority or no""? So they were giving me the authority indirectly. And all of this was really, I think, kept me working hard without this voice, without going to their offices and asking why you are not giving me a serious job? Why you are not giving me the authority? Why you are not giving me a job title that I have to earn? All of this I think made everything smooth. And to be honest, I was thinking about the future more. If I was really not working, however I was there and asking for more and more and more, it might indirectly affect the females who will come after me. So just keep everything smooth and everything will go perfect, since the uncles are supporting you, everything will be perfect. Just keep it.
Even if it would take a longer time, as they say, and Alhamdulillah, we are here and all the girls are happy. We have authorities that we never ever imagine that we will get. And the uncles and the cousins all are proud of what we are doing. And this is for me is the success. When you see the family is proud of what you do. Whenever there is an article in the magazines, or whenever there are anybody who's talking, whatever, if I'm a speaker in any conference, you can see all the cousins are sending messages, are sending emails. We are proud. Good. But these little words really keep you, as you said, and working for-
Maya: Motivated and encouraged.
Basma: Yes. To be honest. Yes. And I can't blame them. Maybe at the beginning, it was really hard because it was not something norm, it's not normal to be working and a female to be working in a corporate environment. So I can't blame them to be honest. However, they really made everything go smooth. And today I'm happy to see them proud of me and all of the female cousins who are really working hard.
Maya: So it's really a testament to your resilience, your abilities, your patience, and also the support that you said you could feel your uncles holding your hand. You could feel their support. So it's a combination of those two things that really helps that. So in creating the path for other family members, I know that one of the programs that you are very passionate about-
Basma: My passion.
Maya: Is about the various programs that you have created to prepare family members. So tell us about perhaps the G2G program and then the Zamil Future Leaders Program.
Basma: Sure. So in 2005 the Zamil family have written the constitution and they have a consultants firm that came to their offices and they really begin with all of this, we can say early here in the region. It's something that's really nice. They have-
Maya: Creating your family constitution. And all of that was early in the region. Yes.
Basma: Yes, it was. Yeah. It was through the Saudi families at that time, they never have this ever. So to be honest, until today there a lot of Saudi family businesses, they don't have a proper family office, a proper constitution. The government is really working hard today on this and educating the family businesses to have it. The Zamil family had really, I can say from the first families that they have this, they have the Talents Committee. Luckily my male cousins, they joined the Talents Committee and they have all the privileges of having mentors, have the privilege of going to trainings and they really worked hard with all the male cousins through these years. However, in 2010, when I joined, there were the moment that, ""Okay, why can I join""? And I was not welcomed a lot to be honest. And I was like, ""Okay, that's fine. Just keep it for the male. And I'm happy. I have my degree. I hold my PhD. I don't need any more training. I have read a lot of books"".
At that moment I realized, ""Okay, why don't we go to the younger cousins? Why don't we go to the grandchildren""? And here were where the idea came off of. It's like, ""Okay, these are the cousins who are now they are in their mid thirties and above. Okay, what about the other cousins""? And from there, the G2G program has begun. It was really something small and I'm happy that today is something all the family is proud of.
Maya:  And what age do you start with the other cousins?
Basma: Six years.
Maya: Amazing.
Basma: Yeah. So the G2G program is really from six years old until they graduate from the university. We have an internship program for six months with us, after that they will move to the Zamil Future Leaders Program.
Maya: And what do you do with say the six to eight year olds? The really young ones? People often ask about that.
Basma: Sure. Yeah. So when we talk about the G2G program, it's a program, it really concentrates about the next gen. I can talk about the five tiers that we really focus on is the social, financial, educational, all of these aspects, that whatever they can't really take it from school, we as a G2G program, we will provide it to them. What's missing in the school it's there in G2G. The most important things that we always think about is we have to have them together as a family. And as I mentioned, that we are a big family. So whenever the program is done there, we want the family to be together. We are in different cities. So we will put them all together in one room without their friends. They are in different schools so we have to let them know each other, to be honest.
And at the same time, usually the programs that we do, it usually there is a challenge that they have to have in this program. So either they have to raise money for charity. They have a business that we give them any program for as an entrepreneur, you have to have a business plan. So all the programs that we have, it's a challenging program. And usually we try to let the boys and girls who are in the teenagers, they prepare the programs for the kids who are six, seven years old. So the audience is your cousins. You can feed all of this together.
Maya: So alongside teaching them, it's a great way to connect the cousins, help them get to know each other and to spend time together.
Basma: Exactly. And on the other hand, usually we like to give them little bit of the business. So we try to take them in the tours to the factories. We like to give them like, okay, we've had couple of employees who have been working with Zamil for more than 30 years to come and to talk to them about these Zamil values, about how do they work with the uncles all of these years. Why they are with Zamil for all of these years, so they can understand how important loyalty is to your employees, how important the values of Zamil to you and to your employees, to everybody around you. So all of these programs, I think are important.
We try to make different programs from six years til 10, they have a special programs. And then from 10 to 15, they have special and then 15 to high school. And then when they are in the university, they have different programs. Each program, it depends on the age. It depends on what their needs. Usually I have them at the beginning of the year and they will choose what programs they want. This year one of the ideas that they want, they wanted to learn more about the stock market. And I was really happy that okay, they asked and okay, that's fine. We will have people who they are experts in the stock market and they will lecture you. Even if they did not really benefit from it, however, just asking them and letting them know about the stock market is nice for them.
Maya: Absolutely.
Basma: Yes. So I think G2G program is something the family is proud of, to be honest.
Maya: Absolutely. And I think it's super wonderful as well to see how you're building that emotional connection with the company. I love the example of the employees talking about the family values and the importance of the company and why they've stayed so long. So let's talk a little bit more about how your family has made sure that the vision and values of the founders is not lost through the generations. What are some other things that you do to really instill those family values in future generations?
Basma: Yeah, sure. To be honest, the values, I believe that the most important thing for us is really to transfer this values to the grandchildren. I had the opportunity to live with my uncles, to hear their stories, to see how do they deal with their employees. How do they deal even with anybody in the street? However, the grandchildren did not have this chance to really live with them and to hear what do they say, and to listen to their stories. Through these ideas, I think that having everybody gathering in one place, it's a great idea. We have the family assembly. It's assembly that we meet one time a year, and the uncles, they talk really informally to all the grandchildren. And just to give them some stories, just to chat with them. We don't talk anything about business. It's really about the family values. We have to have one of the third generation who is really successful in his work will come and will talk about his story. Will come and talk about his challenges to all these younger generation.
So they can see that, okay, we can one day be there. It's really nice. We printed out a book and that book is really has a lot of values that we indirectly put it for the next generation. That book had all the activities that the G2G has done from 2012 until today. So it's all the 10 years work of the G2G. It's a very simple language. The book was titled, From You We Learned, and we had the picture of the grandfather on the cover page. If you went through the book and you read the programs, we had it in a very simple language, like one girl, she is talking to her grandfather and saying for him, ""Okay, we are here. We are continuing your legacy. We are working hard to continue what you have begun. And this is some of the work that we have done together, and we would continue working together"".
Maya: Wow, that's lovely.
Basma: Yeah. So it's like an indirect message. At the first page it was saying that, ""Okay, this book is given to the grandfather. It's from us, the grandchildren to our grandfather for all of what he has done for us"". And I think this will give them a very, I can say an indirect message about the values. In between the book we can... Okay, I can give you an example. A program about giving back a charity. So this little girl in the book saying, ""Okay, grandfather, you have been working a lot with the charities and you've been giving a lot of the charities. Today, it's our turn to give back the charities. And this is what we have done to continue what you have done"".
Maya: Great.
Basma: So this was the language of the book, and I'm really excited. We will do a very big celebration to give everybody this book, inshallah.
Maya: Wonderful, wonderful. And I'm sure they'd love to have it, and it will have pride of place in everyone's home.
Basma: Yes. I'm sure.
Maya: To shift gears a little bit, many people hear the term family governance and are often confused by what does it mean? It sounds really formal and bureaucratic. I wonder if you could share your thoughts as to what family governance means to you and your family and how you've organized yourselves.
Basma: Sure. When I talk about Zamil, the uncles have worked through the past years to really separate business from the family. And I think it's an important step. It's really an important step. Sometimes I can say, it's not easy. It's really not easy. However, you have to be really clear about separating family from business for us. When we talk about the governance, we are talking about a book that has all the, we can say the ideas that the uncles really wants all the cousins to know, all the next generation to know and really to think about, okay, this governance is not only for you or for him or for her. It's really for the benefit of the whole family. And you have to think about it. Maybe it will not fit you. Maybe what's written there you will not like it. However, you have to really think big about it.
For us it's a written constitution. As I have mentioned, the first one was written in 2005 and it's updated. The last update was in 2019. And I am really happy to be part of the update because in the new version of it, we had the female. So it's really talking about male and female. It's not only about male. The old version it was all the dedicated to male. So in the new version, no, it is both. Either you are male or female, the constitution is there for you. So we had the third generation entering in the Family Council. How can we were really thinking hard? How can the third generation to enter the Family Council and all of the Talent Committees? And so it was a really big editing in 2019.
Maya: So it really creates a sense of fairness and this clarity as well.
Basma:  Exactly.
Maya: Because it's the same protocols that apply to everyone.
Basma: Exactly. Yes. So it's there, it's written. There will be exceptions. There will be some, however, you have really this book that's written and everybody has to read it. Everybody has to really know in back of their head what's written there and they will work on what's written there.
Maya: What I'm really struck by in your family, Basma, and what you've done is you have this formal arrangements of written constitution. You have a family council, family office, a talent committee, family gathering committee, et cetera. And at the same time, you spend a lot of time and invest energy and funds as well in really building connection between family members through family gatherings and G2G and other programs. This is really wonderful. And it really strikes me as something quite special.
Basma: To be honest, I think for us, we can say the most important thing that we are really looking forward to, we want them to love the logo. We want them to believe that the logo has to be up there. So with all of these formal, informal, all of the connections, all of the help, this is really the things that will let these grandchildren love the logo. Whenever they lo love it, they would really work hard to keep it up. And this is exactly what we are looking forward to.
Maya: And creates a wonderful new set of family managers and owners of your wonderful company.
Basma: And it'll help these cousins to know how to deal with each other, to talk to each other. They would really know each other in all of these informal gatherings, especially when you are from different schools, from different backgrounds, all of these gathering will let them know each other more.
Maya: Basma, perhaps in conclusion, from everything that you have learned over the years, what would be your advice to any family on how to involve and engage the next generation?
Basma: The connection between the family members. I think this is the most important thing. Every family business really has to work hard on the connection. It's not easy. There will be couple of conflicts. However, the connections are really important for the family members, as much as they can. It's really something important. The learning and development of the next gen is something that we did not have the opportunity. However, the next gen, I can see it in their eyes. I can see it when they come back to my office and say to me, ""Thank you for all the training that you have done to us"". I'm happy that last week, one of the next gen, he's in Boston and he got a job there and he called me and he was like, ""Thank you"". And he was like, ""Why""? And he was like, ""Okay. I was really selected because of the trainings of the G2G.
Maya: That's amazing.
Basma: And it was like, ""What do you mean""? And he was like, ""Okay. Through the interview, what really gave me the extra credit is the G2G trainings that we went through. And they were really excited about, wow, how is your family working with you from 10 years old and giving you all of these trainings? And I was like, ""Did you put the G2G training in your CV""? And he was like, ""Yes. And even the logo of the G2G, I have put it on the CV"". And I was like, ""Wow, thank you"". I was really happy, Maya about it. And I was really happy that he called me back.
And he said to me that the people who have interviewed me, they really were highlighting the G2G program. They asked me to talk more about the G2G program. They asked me to about the family. Okay. What do you do? And why is your family really are working hard for you from you're 10 years old. And I was really happy about this call. So this is a second thing that I really wanted to mention, really work hard on the training and the development of the family. It'll reflect back one day.
Maya: Thank you very much Basma with those very wise words. I'd like to thank you again for joining us. And it's been a real pleasure to have this conversation with you.
Basma: Thank you very much, Maya. It was really, as I've said, it's an honor for me and the Zamil family to be part of the podcast of JP Morgan.
Maya: Thank you very much.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Overview of tax and legal issues non-residents should considerMany non-French residents wish to acquire a second home in France, in the mountains, by the sea or in town, for example in Paris.
Real estate is subject to a range of taxes in France be it during acquisition with registration fees, annually with property tax, wealth tax and income tax or capital gains tax. Finally, a transfer to the next generation will likely result in the payment of inheritance or gift taxes. For these reasons it is essential, before an acquisition, to pay particular attention to how the purchase should be structured.
This note highlights some of the tax and legal considerations that form part of residential property purchases in France.  It should act as an introduction to the topic to help inform your detailed discussions with your independent tax and legal advisors. JP Morgan does not provide tax or legal advice, therefore it is essential that you seek full and proper personal advice in advance of any purchases
A. The legal process
Purchasing property in France, as in other European countries ruled by civil law, is a formal process, with clearly defined steps and participants.
Step one: The pre-contract (preliminary agreement)
The pre-contract is a contract that contains the terms and conditions of the transaction, including: price, terms of payment and transfer of the property, furniture and various objects that the buyer receives and conditions for cancellation. It can be drawn up as a private document or as an officially recorded instrument. The pre-contract is as important as the final contract. Although the pre-contract can be drawn up by the seller and buyer, the involvement of a notaire (French solicitor) is strongly advised to ensure the instrument is correctly prepared.
The notaire(s) can be freely chosen. The seller and buyer can each involve their own notaire without increasing costs because the notaires will share the fees.
Time limit for withdrawing from the agreement
At the signing of the pre-contract, the notaire provides the buyer with a certificate stating the buyer has a seven-day period within which to withdraw from the contract.
The pre-contract: promesse unilatérale de vente (unilateral promise to sell) or compromis de vente (provisional sale agreement)
The compromis is a promise to sell and involves reciprocal obligations that are tantamount to a sale.
The seller and buyer cannot release themselves from the agreement except in the event of non-fulfillment of any of the conditions of the sale. Buyers generally provide a deposit of 5% to 10% of the price, which is forfeited if they fail to make the purchase.
The promesse unilatérale de vente only commits the seller to sell a specific property, at a specific price, on a specific date. It does not commit a buyer to purchase the property.
If a buyer decides against purchasing, he or she must give the seller an indemnité d’immobilisation (compensation for being prevented from making a sale to another party), which represents 10% of the price. The deposit made when signing the pre-contract guarantees, at least partially, the payment of this “indemnité”. This amount will be credited toward the sale price if the sale goes through.
However, thanks to the Loi Scrivener (a French law enacted to protect consumers), when a buyer has applied for a loan, the compromis or promesse is conditional on the loan being obtained. If a buyer does not obtain the loan, he or she owes neither a penalty nor an indemnity and the pre-contract is null and void.
To further assure fairness, the pre-contract stipulates the maximum lending rate that a buyer is required to accept, the name of the bank to which the buyer has applied for the loan and the deadline for obtaining the loan.
Step two: Between the pre-contract and the contract
Between the pre-contract and the final signing of the sale, the buyer must obtain the loan and complete certain steps and verifications. The buyer then provides the notaire with the certificate and the acceptance of the loan application.
Notaires carry out certain formalities during this period that ensure the enforceability and the balance of the contract. They also investigate the possible occurrence of a Droit de Préemption Urbain (DPU) (municipal right of first refusal). For buyers of undeveloped land, they often purchase the land, with the sale contingent upon obtaining a building permit. Thus, between the pre-contract and the final contract, they must apply for a building permit and make sure that the authorization is clear of any objections or legal encumbrances.
Step three: Signing the final contract
The acquisition of real estate in France must take place in the presence of a notaire. Once the conditions of sale have been satisfied, the seller and buyer sign in the presence of a notaire the instrument that officially records the change in the property’s ownership and implements payment of the sale/purchase price.
Step four: After the sale
The deed of sale is lodged with the mortgage registry that records all the transactions. Some months later, the notaire sends the authenticated copy that constitutes the buyer’s certificate of title. The original of the official instrument remains for 100 years at the office of the notaire that received it.
B. REGISTRATION, NOTARY FEES AND VALUE ADDED TAX (VAT)
Registration fees
Registration fees amounting to a percentage of the purchase price (5.09% to 5.80% depending on the location of the property) are due:
At the time of registration of the conveyance of a French real estate asset.
Regardless of where the buyer and seller reside, for tax purposes, in France or another country.
Regardless of whether the real asset is acquired directly by an individual or through a company primarily dealing in French or foreign real estate.
Frais de notaire (fees, including taxes payable, calculated by the notaire).
The fees received by notaires go only partially to the notaires themselves. Most of the fees they collect are turned over to the government for various purposes such as registration fees, mortgage registry fee and real estate registration tax. All in all, registration duties and notary fees represent approximately 7% of the price.
NB: New buildings are not subject to registration fees, but are subject to VAT
C. INCOME TAX ON REAL ESTATE INCOME
If you decide to rent out your new property in France, the income you receive will be subject to income tax and should be declared to the French authorities, it will be necessary to file a French tax return. This annual tax declaration is mandatory and must provide the tax authorities complete information concerning the taxpayer's identity, marital and family situation, as well as the taxpayer’s income from French sources.
French income tax on rental income is payable by non-residents at progressive rates after allowable deductions for expenses incurred in connection with letting or maintaining the property (e.g. interest payable on a local mortgage, repairs and maintenance, certain real estate taxes, management expenses such as concierge and security, etc.).
The general rule is that the taxable income of a non-resident taxpayer is subject to a minimum tax rate of 20%. However, if the taxpayer can justify that his effective rate of tax on his worldwide income would be below 20% were the taxpayer a French resident, this lower effective tax rate can apply instead of the 20% minimum rate.Non-residents are liable to the social tax at a flat rate of 17.2%. However, if they can justify that they are affiliated to a social security regime within a country of the European Economic Area or Switzerland, the social tax rate is 7.5%.
Furnished and unfurnished properties are treated differently for tax purposes:
Unfurnished property
Treated as non-commercial property (“régime réel”).  Taxed on income, less deductions for allowable expenses. Non-residents can benefit from a simplified scheme (“régime micro foncier”) where, when income is <€15,000, a deduction of 30% for related costs is permitted in determining taxable income.
Furnished property
Treated as commercial property. Non-residents have a choice in the method they use to determine taxation. Where income <€70,000, a deduction of 50% for related costs is permitted in determining taxable income. For income >€70,000, or where an individual chooses to opt out of the simplified scheme, taxation is calculated on an actual receipts/costs basis (“régime normal”).
D. French Real Estate Wealth Tax (IFI)
Non-resident individuals are liable for the Impôt sur la fortune immobilière (IFI,) on the net asset value of their French real estate assets above €1,300,000.
The taxable base is calculated as of January the 1
st
each year, based on the market value of each property after deducting certain liabilities. Once the threshold of €1,300,000 is reached, the tax schedule applies.IFI applies to:
Real estate;
Real estate rights;
Shares in French or foreign companies or any kind of structure (with the assessable value limited to the extent of the value of the underlying real estate or rights owned directly or indirectly by the company).
The taxable value of the shares will be assessed as follows:
Step 1: Shares taken at their market value, with qualifying liabilities of the company deducted from the calculation. The following liabilities are non-deductible:
Debts entered into by the company to purchase the real estate asset from the taxpayer or a member of the tax household;
Debts entered into by the company issued by the taxpayer or a member of the tax household; or
Debts entered into by the company issued by another company that is controlled by the taxpayer or a member of their family.
These exceptions can be deducted from the market value of the shares of the company if the taxpayer can justify that such loans are not motivated by a predominantly tax-avoidance purpose.
Step 2:  The pro rata value of the company’s real estate assets is then applied to the valuation, excluding:
Real estate assets owned by operating companies and used by them for the purpose of their activities; and
Shareholding in operating companies in which the taxpayer holds less than 10% capital or voting rights.
Exemptions:
Shares in an operating company in which the taxpayer holds less than 10% capital or voting rights.
Real estate belonging to an operating company that is used for the purpose of that company’s business activities.
Holdings in a French listed real estate investment company (SIIC) in which the taxpayer has less than 5% capital or voting rights.
UCIs (Undertakings for Collective Investments) and investment funds: Taxation under the IFI excludes holdings below 10% in UCIs and investment funds where the assets of which comprise less than 20% taxable real estate.
Real estate assets belonging to taxpayers for whom that real estate forms part of their professional activity (under special conditions).
Individuals relocating to France who have not been French resident during the past five years are exempted from IFI on their real estate assets located abroad for the five first years of their French residency. After five years’ residence in France, the IFI will apply to their worldwide real estate holdings.
All debts in existence as at 1
st
January of each year entered into by the taxpayer are deductible if such debts relate to:
Financing the purchase of the property;
Financing repair and maintenance expenses of the property;
Expenditure relating to the improvement, construction, reconstruction or expansion of the property;
Acquisition costs of units or shares in a fund or company, prorated to the value of taxable real estate assets held;
Land taxes borne by the landlord and the IFI (the personal tax due for income generated by real estate and housing taxes are not deductible).
A number of loans are not deductible:
Family loans subscribed directly or indirectly from a member of the tax household;
Family loans subscribed directly or indirectly from the family group except to justify normal conditions of the loan;
Loans from a company controlled by one of the persons mentioned above.
Limitations:
Bullet loans contracted for the purchase of real estate are deductible but a tax notional amortization over the period of the loan has to be applied.
Loans that do not provide a term for repayment of principal (i.e. on demand facility) are deductible with a notional amortization of 1/20
th
per year since the payment of the loan.
When the value of taxable assets exceeds €5,000,000 and the total amount of deductible debts exceeds 60% of this value, the debts would only be deductible above €5,000,000 by 50%, unless the taxpayer confirms that the debts were not contracted mainly for a tax avoidance purpose.
E. 3% annual tax
All legal entities (such as companies and trusts) which own French real estate, directly or indirectly, are subject to an annual tax of 3% of the market value of the property. There are many cases where exemption can be claimed but very often a tax form needs to be filed every year. This tax does not discharge the company to pay other taxes and is not deductible from a company’s profit or other taxes.
Exemptions:
Certain companies are exempt from this annual tax:
Companies that do not have the majority of their French assets invested in French real estate (e.g., where more than 50% of the company’s assets consist of French financial investments such as French mutual funds, shares issued by a French company, French government bonds or French corporate bonds). In this case, the company is not primarily dealing in real estate and is therefore not subject to the 3% annual tax.
Companies located in a country that has a treaty with France providing for mutual administrative assistance. In this case exemption is possible if certain conditions are fulfilled. The identity and certain details concerning the shareholders or the owner, such as the number of shares they own and their rights, must be disclosed to French authorities each year. If the shareholder is a company or a company chain, the ownership details must also be disclosed.
Companies located in a country that has a treaty with France providing for mutual administrative assistance, or based in a country that has a treaty with France, including a non-discrimination clause to disclose information about its assets and its shareholders (those who hold 1% or more of the shares), within two months following the acquisition.
F. CAPITAL GAINS ON THE SALE
Non-French residents — whether French or foreign nationals — who own real estate in France are subject to special capital gains tax treatment, including:
Income tax at a flat rate of 19%.
Social tax at a flat rate of 17.2% or 7.5%.
Extra tax of 2% to 6% for capital gains exceeding €50,000.
French capital gains taxes apply on any gain made by individuals on:
The sale of French real estate own directly;
The sale by a tax-transparent SCI of French real estate;
The sale of shares of listed real estate companies such as SIIC, Sppicav (or foreign equivalent) when the seller owns more than 10%; or
The sale of shares of a French or foreign company qualified as a SPI. A SPI is an unlisted entity composed for more than 50% of French real estate or of rights relating to French real estate.
Non-residents are liable to the social tax at a flat rate of 17.2%. However, if they can justify that they are affiliated to a social security regime within a country of the European Economic Area or Switzerland, the social tax rate is 7.5%.
The taxable base is subject to progressive allowances depending on the length of the ownership, resulting in exemption from the tax after 30 years of ownership:The designation of an accredited tax representative is mandatory when the seller is not domiciled within the European Economic Area (Liechtenstein being excluded of the EEA for this provision).
In addition to the above taxation, an extra tax applies on net gains (after application of the progressive allowances) which exceed €50,000. The rates are between 2% and 6% (the higher rate of 6% applies on gains exceeding €260,000).
Exemptions:
Sale of the former principal private residence in France
Since January 1st, 2019, the sale of the former principal private residence in France is exempted if:
the seller is a resident of a country member of the EU or which has signed with France a treaty aimed to avoid tax evasion;
the sale is effective at least the 31
st
of December of the year following the year of relocation out of France;
between the relocation and the sale, the property must not be rented out or be lent for free to anybody.
Dwellings in France owned by non-residents
Notwithstanding the general rule imposing capital gains tax on the sale of French real estate, a special rule applies to:
nationals of the EU, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein;
and
nationals of other countries provided that they can present a right to a clause of non-discrimination.
This rule exempts them from capital gains tax on the sale of their dwelling in France. The exemption applies to the sale of one property, starting January the 1
st
, 2014, and is subject to two conditions:
1.
The sellers were continuously domiciled in France for at least two years, at any time before the sale;
and
2.
The sale:
a.
is made at the latest on the 31
st
of December of the 5
th
year following the exit of France by the seller (whether the dwelling is rented or not);
or
b.
concerns a house that has not been rented since January the 1
st
of the year preceding the sale (hence the need to provide proof of two years’ payment of the residence tax).
This exemption is limited to a fraction of €150,000 of the capital gain (after taking into account of the applicable allowances), the surplus of the gain remaining taxable.
G. TRANSFERRING PROPERTY
In the event of death:
French real estate is subject to transfer taxes (inheritance tax) even if the heir is not a French resident.
Assets that are invested outside of France are subject to French tax when the heirs are French residents or have been residents for six years during the 10 previous years.
The net market value is the basis for French inheritance tax.
Some principles of French inheritance law do not exist in other countries, such as the “réserve héréditaire” (i.e. a forced portion reserved for heirs).
France has signed thirty-five tax treaties intended to avoid double taxation in relation to inheritance taxes but only seven in relation to gift taxes.
French inheritance tax normally applies at progressive rates
.
In the direct line (i.e. transfers to children and parents), the rates rise from 5% to 45%, depending on the value of a beneficiary’s share of the estate (the marginal rate of 45% applies on a share exceeding €1,805,677).
Death transfers between spouses are not taxed, and assets that pass to an unrelated beneficiary are taxed at a flat rate of 60%, regardless of their value.
Broadly speaking, the rates applying to other family members vary between 35% and 55%.
French inheritance tax can also apply on assets passing through a trust at flat rates which can be very high (up to 60% in certain cases).
Under French law, individuals cannot dispose of theirassets upon death as they wish, and cannot deprive certain heirs (notably children) from taking up some part of their estates. The use of a company to own French real estate prevents the application of these restrictive rules. In accordance with French Private International Law principles, shares of companies are characterized as “movable” assets, and so are dealt with in accordance with the succession law of the State in which an individual is habitually resident at the time of his or her death.
H. SOCIETE CIVILE IMMOBILIERE (SCI)
The Société Civile Immobilière (SCI)— in English a “non-trading real estate investment company”— is a fairly common method of holding a real estate asset in France and can be used by both French residents and non-residents.
A SCI is generally a tax-transparent company that can opt (irrevocably) to be subject to corporate income tax.
When the property is an asset to which a family holds rights of enjoyment, the transparent SCI is a simple holding method without any tax implications.
The company does not receive rental income and therefore has no tax to pay on rental income.
An SCI is a useful method of organization, for example, for the purpose of transferring shares to several children (through a gift or otherwise), while leaving the management of the property to the parents as managers of the non-trading company.
Owning real estate through an SCI may allow non-residents to avoid the French réserve héréditaire rule that generally applies only to directly held real estate assets.
Final thoughts
There is a lot to think about when purchasing French residential property. There is a clear need to take early and detailed tax and legal advice from independent advisors.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Although allocations to fixed income haven’t protected multi-asset portfolios over the first half of the year, in our view this asset class can reclaim its traditional safe-haven status as inflation begins to fade.Stewart Edginton, Head of EMEA Managed Solutions
The first half of 2022 has been the worst start to a year for a balanced portfolio since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis (figure 1). Market cycles have a habit of surprising, which recent events highlight. The main cause this time around is inflation, which many of us have underestimated. With the benefit of hindsight, it’s easy to understand how geopolitical events have magnified the problem.The only broad asset class that has risen this year is commodities, and energy in particular. The market had good reason to be underweight this theme – including COP 26 in November last year, which progressed the global effort to reduce the world’s carbon footprint. With the increasing popularity of ESG investing, the energy sector had been given a wide berth. Yet recent events have illustrated that the transition to new energy sources is likely to be difficult and protracted. As a result, the broad commodity complex is likely to remain on investor radars for some time.
Although stock market volatility has been particularly high this year, conservative investors have really felt the impact because of the losses within fixed income. As rates have risen, bonds have fallen in value. In addition, corporate bond spreads have widened because investors are demanding a higher yield as compensation for the additional risk.
The result is that core bonds
1
lost 9% over the first six months of 2022 and conservative portfolios typically have a higher allocation to fixed income. According to Morningstar, the median cautious US dollar strategy lost 11.2% in the first half
2
of 2022.
Don’t fight the Fed
Uncertainty around geopolitics and oil prices remains high. Will inflation remain stubbornly elevated or can western central banks achieve their 2% targets? At times of uncertainty, it’s usually a good idea to focus on what we do know and then size investment exposures according to the probabilities assigned to different outcomes.
Risk asset valuations are clearly more reasonable today than at the start of the year following a significant derating in both equities and bonds. This positive correlation is why traditional multi-asset portfolios have not protected capital this year. As we saw in the Financial Crisis, valuations can keep falling and trying to time the bottom is a fruitless task – it’s something you only ever know after the event. But this isn’t the Financial Crisis. As of now, both corporate and personal balance sheets are in good shape compared with the past, and even with some sort of economic slowdown, job availability is high as supply chains are rebuilt. The present macroeconomic environment is very different from then.
An old investing adage is ‘Don’t fight the Fed’. Chairman Powell’s last testimony was clear – policymakers will target the reduction of inflation at the expense of growth. Over recent weeks, markets have begun to price this outcome (figure 2).This messaging may have caused a regime shift and we expect a change in asset class leadership in the second half, with fixed income making a comeback. How do we have confidence in this forecast after such a painful first half and why can’t the asset class keep getting cheaper? Let’s take the 10-year Treasuries as an illustration of what’s happened this year (figure 3). For euro-based portfolios, we could substitute 10-year Bunds.The yield began the year around 1.5% and subsequently rose to a peak close to 3.5% before moving back to around 3%. Some investors believe the rate should move to 4% or beyond. But keep in mind that the 10-year rate is effectively the average of base rates over that period. There is scope for base rates to reach those higher levels for a short period but recent market moves suggest this would be recessionary (just as the market indicated in the fourth quarter of 2018, when the Fed was last in tightening mode).
During recessions, rates tend to come down – the Fed would pivot and soften its stance.
So choosing longer maturity bonds can protect you from this recessionary scenario.
Indeed, a move back to a 2% level for 10-year Treasuries would result in positive double-digit returns.
We take confidence from the Fed’s estimate of ‘the neutral rate’. This is the equilibrium level of interest rates that allows the economy to progress at trend growth – neither expansionary nor contractionary. We can debate the right level for neutral but the Fed estimates it at 2.4%. With US 10-year Treasuries trading at 2.8%, the market is telling us these bonds have capital appreciation potential (bond values go up when yields come down). Aside from the absolute level of interest being more attractive, this level now gives the potential for portfolio protection from slowing growth. When the yield was at 1.5% at the start of the year, it was below the neutral rate and we know what happened. Now we are above the neutral rate, the potential for negative correlation has returned and that means multi-asset portfolios can begin to work again.
Protect portfolios and generate additional yield
How can we implement these views in portfolios? The starting point has to be a base case. We believe the Fed will achieve something close to a soft landing, but think the risks of tight policy causing a recession have risen towards 40–45%. Uncertainty and left-tail event risk is high. Given the case we have set out for fixed income, we believe core bonds look reasonable value in a soft-landing scenario (we estimate 10-year Treasuries will trade around 2.5% by the middle of next year). But growth surprising to the downside would see that rate moving lower, producing higher returns from core fixed income.
In the first half of this year, one of the only ways to protect portfolios in nominal terms was to hold cash. As the cycle progresses from high inflation to lower growth, investors seeking some protection can hold core fixed income because it can make capital gains when growth slows (especially after an interest rate hiking cycle). This allocation should also mean that a multi-asset portfolio can defend better through equity volatility than it did in the first half. Indeed, our Chief Investment Office team has been adding to quality duration as rates have been rising.
Just as the market was underweight energy exposure at the start of the year, it is now underweight core bonds, which can heighten the chance of returns surprising to the upside in a slowing growth scenario. Keep in mind that portfolios leaning too much towards an inflationary scenario are ‘fighting the Fed’.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.The second gear of the Manchin-Schumer bill
Whenever there’s a tax/spending bill passed by Congress, the Congressional Budget Office “scores” the bill with respect to its impact on deficits, debt and GDP. The guts of the CBO process require dynamic scoring models that estimate the tax impact of every provision in the bill, and everyone sees the detailed results. While the Manchin-Schumer bill would accelerate the US energy transition, there was no CBO-style analysis released by the bill’s principal authors to support the assertion of a 40% decline in GHG emissions by the year 2030. Such analyses reportedly exist; the questions on the next page are what I would ask about them.To be clear, the stated target entails a 30% decline in emissions from 2021 since 2030 targets typically use 2005 as a reference point. The Manchin-Schumer bill is mostly focused on tax credits to incentivize decarbonization; less is dedicated to more challenging siting, scale, geological, chemical, policy and regulatory obstacles we discussed in this year’s energy piece.
My best guess is that the bill would shift the US renewable transition from first to second gear, but that the GHG decline by 2030 would be nowhere near the 40% decline cited
.
There may be a separate bill coming this fall (negotiated by Manchin as a quid pro quo) to simplify permitting and siting issues. I will believe it when I see it given the history of judiciary decisions reaffirming state’s rights and rejecting Federal eminent domain assertions. But if this siting bill materializes, combined with provisions Manchin has required for oil/gas development, battery and rare earth supply chain development and passage of the CHIPS bill
1
, Democrats will have constructed a new industrial policy, something which seemed out of reach a few weeks ago. I wish I knew how much it is all really going to cost.What we need to know to assess the 2030 GHG target
What percentage of new car sales and what percentage of the total fleet would be electrified by 2030 given the new incentives?
2
What kind of gasoline savings are assumed for HEVs, given how sensitive outcomes are to driver behavior?
3
The bill contains provisions requiring that rising shares of EV battery components and rare earth metals be sourced in the US or from its allies by 2024 in order for buyers to be eligible for the $7,500 tax credit at point of sale.
These provisions could dramatically reduce the availability of the EV tax credit unless there is a complete and unprecedented shift in related manufacturing processes from China back to the US
4
What is the assumed penetration of sustainable aviation fuels and hydrogen/battery long-haul trucks by 2030? Both of these technologies do not exist yet in any meaningful way
5
What kind of heat pump penetration is assumed to result by 2030 compared to current levels? Will homeowners retain backup thermal systems for very cold days or not?
6
How much more quickly can wind and solar power really be built compared to current levels? For the last few years, new US wind/solar capacity has increased its share of US electricity generation by ~1.2% per year. Grid interconnection challenges and interstate transmission siting (see our energy paper this year) are more binding as constraints than a lack of capital or cost of capital. Btw, China reliance is massive here as well
7
What kind of grid expansion is assumed to take place to accommodate more electrification of transportation and winter heating? For the last decade, the grid has only been expanding at 0.5%-1.0% per year, and most decarbonization plans with 40% assumed GHG reductions require 5%-8% annual grid expansion
Press articles mention incentives for geothermal. How much is geothermal assumed to contribute in 2030? Today it’s a rounding error, accounting for just 0.1% of US primary energy consumption
What is assumed by 2030 regarding the amount of US CO
2
emissions that are geologically sequestered, used for enhanced oil recovery or converted into fuels? Are tax credits ranging from $60 to $85 per ton of CO
2
enough to cover capital, maintenance and return requirements? Based on currently operating CCS facilities plus those planned and permitted, just 1%-2% of US emissions are on track to be sequestered in 2030·
What kind of continued improvements in energy efficiency per unit of GDP are assumed for 2030, given greater incentives for home improvement and insulation?
8
Does any serious person really believe that advanced nuclear or direct air carbon capture
9
will have a material impact on US GHG emission declines by 2030?
Bottom line.
The Manchin-Schumer bill would accelerate the renewable transition and be the most aggressive climate action taken to date by Congress. It certainly will enrich and sustain a lot of business models in the renewable energy space that are reliant on subsidies; many of them are rallying already. But let’s not delude ourselves about the pace or the high cost of this transition
10
, or delude ourselves about the need for a lot of natural gas along the way. The US already faces unprecedented challenges regarding its electricity grid, and any steps that reduce dispatchable power such as natural gas could lead to “disastrous results”.
11
I have not even addressed the US natural gas expansion required to rescue Europe from its energy disaster; European natural gas and electricity prices are 5x-7x higher than US levels, which is nothing short of terrifying from an economic and political perspective.1
$52 billion for US semiconductor R&D, $24 billion for US semiconductor plant tax credits, $200 billion in science and technology research funding
2
JP Morgan’s Commodity Research Team models oil demand using automaker commitments that 25%-50% of sales will be EVs by 2030, up from 9% in 2021 and 12% in June 2022 (these figures include HEVs with very small batteries charged only by regenerative braking). Even if these EV sales targets are met, given current vehicle average lives of 12 years,
only 1 out of 6 passenger cars in the US fleet would be electrified by 2030
3
The most recent data we have seen cite
20%-30% declines in lifecycle GHG emissions for HEV and PHEV
vehicles based on actual driver behaviors. This compares to 65%-80% GHG declines for battery electric vehicles
4
According to the bill: the “critical mineral” minimum percentage for US/FTA countries is 40% for 2024, 50% in 2024, 60% in 2025, 70% in 2026, and 80% beyond that. For battery components: 50% in 2024, 60% in 2025, 70% in 2026, 80% in 2027, 90% in 2028, and 100% thereafter.
Current US/FTA shares for battery components and critical minerals are in single digits
5
In 2019, US sustainable aviation fuel production (from plants, agricultural waste, sewage, cooking oil) was just
3 million gallons out of 26 billion gallons
of jet fuel consumed. On hydrogen trucks: start with 1 kWh of green electricity from wind/solar. By the time this energy is converted into hydrogen via electrolysis and converted by a fuel cell back into electricity to power the truck’s motor,
around 70%-75% of the original energy is lost
6
Currently, just 6% of US residential space heating is produced by heat pumps. As discussed in this year’s energy paper,
if heat pumps replace on-site combustion of fossil fuels without backup thermal power, generation capacity and transmission would have to be built for the handful of coldest days when electrified heating would skyrocket
, creating load demand which could double vs current levels. There are a lot of policy issues to tackle before assuming seamless electrification of residential and commercial winter heating.
7
China makes 97% of solar wafers, 85% of solar cells, 79% of polysilicon and 75% of solar panels
8
US energy intensity per unit of GDP has declined by almost 30% since the year 2005 due to more efficient machines, turbines, motors, buildings etc. However, over that same time frame, overall exajoules of energy use are roughly constant given rising energy demand which offsets improving efficiency.
9
Some highly profitable technology companies are price-inelastic when it comes to a zero carbon footprint, and are
reportedly paying $1,200 per ton
to startups that capture miniscule amounts of carbon from ambient air. This is irrelevant in the big picture: direct air carbon capture is “an energetically and financially costly distraction in effective mitigation of climate changes at a meaningful scale” [“
Unrealistic energy and materials requirement for direct air capture in deep mitigation pathways
”, Chatterjee and Huang, Nature Communications, 2020]
10
Example: if wind developers pay “prevailing wages” and include enough domestic manufacturing content,
the subsidy they receive rises by 10x from $0.03 per kWh to $0.31 per kWh
. Same kind of provisions for solar subsidies. It does not take a lot of analysis to see that this could quickly become a substantial source of inflation when assessing the true economic cost of wind and solar power.

Recession obsession
Google Trends suggests that this summer, people are searching for “recession” more often than they did even during the spring of 2020 and the Global Financial Crisis. The Treasury market seems to be reflecting recession fears. Despite a rise in yields this week, the yield curve remains inverted, with the two-year yield roughly 40 basis points (bps) higher than the 10-year yield.
The stock market doesn’t seem too fussed, though. Through Thursday, the S&P 500 was continuing its rally and is now about +13% higher than its June 16 bear market low. Tech-y index stalwarts such as Apple, Amazon and Microsoft have led the pack, helping the NASDAQ-100 finish Thursday at its highest level since early May.
As we mused in last week’s
note
, the simultaneous recession obsession and risk asset rally may seem like a head scratcher at first…but this week wasn’t without new reasons to be more hopeful about the path ahead.
Freddie Mac’s survey of home lenders showed that national average 30-year mortgage rates fell to 4.99%, down -31 bps versus last week and -82 bps versus the high at the end of June. Barrels of WTI crude oil are back below $90 for the first time since the invasion of Ukraine, helping coax the national average cost at the gasoline pump down to about $4.14/gallon versus over $5/gallon in mid-June. The labor market remains remarkably resilient, with Friday’s employment data showing that the economy added 528,000 jobs in July—more than double the number expected.
On the other hand, the strong jobs report also showed a pickup in wage growth on the month (to 0.5%, up from 0.4% in June), reminding investors that some inflationary pressures remain stubbornly strong. To boot, we still expect more signs of a broadening economic slowdown from here.
That said, maybe we’re at the point where investors en masse have accepted inflation and growth risks, and are starting to look beyond the slump. Or maybe the recent rally is nothing more than a FOMO-fueled false start.
Spotlight
Bear market rally or bottom?
While the +13% midsummer stock market rally from the lows has been a welcome reprieve, we caution investors not to let their guards down.
The definition of a “bear market rally” is nebulous, but for comparison to today’s price action, we’ve decided historical instances should meet all of the following criteria:
Must follow a drawdown of at least 20% from the market’s previous all-time high.
Must be a gain of 10% or more from the bear market’s prior low.
Must be followed by another decline that represents a new low for the selloff (i.e., not be the first leg in the market’s recovery back to all-time highs).
According to those parameters, we found that five of the six major selloffs since the ’70s had at least one relief rally of more than 10% before dropping again to make fresh lows (2020’s lightning-quick selloff was the exception). The Global Financial Crisis and Tech Bubble each had three; the late ’80s bear market—which was
not
accompanied by a recession—had one.The point is, intra-selloff rallies can and have happened. While we’re not insisting that the S&P 500 will have to retest the 3,666 lows hit in June, we’re not convinced that a sustainable upside path for stocks has gotten any easier at the current juncture. Inflation is still untenably high, the Federal Reserve is keeping its policy options open, and earnings expectations just started getting revised lower.
The high yield bond market is telling a similar story. Over the past month, credit spreads have tightened by more than 100 bps amid the risk-on shift. That said, over the past six months, new issuance of high yield bonds has slowed to ~1% of the overall market size. Since the Global Financial Crisis, past instances of issuance this light typically foretold a swing higher in defaults (the median one-year forward default rate was 4.2%; two-years forward, it was 8.6%).
With defaults still below 1% today, we read this as a signal that credit spreads are likely to widen from here—even if we manage to avoid a recession.Whether historical bear markets were ultimately associated with a U.S. recession may not offer conclusive evidence about the durability of a rally off the lows, but it has seemed to have implications for both the magnitude of the market selloff at its worst and the duration of the slump.
Before this one, we’ve seen a total of 12 bear markets since the end of World War II, nine of which occurred around recessions. The recession bear markets saw an average decline of -36% and peak-to-recovery duration of roughly three-and-a-half years. This contrasts to non-recession bear markets’ average peak-to-trough decline of -28% and duration of about one-and-a-half years.If a recession does come to fruition, we think it is likely to be less severe than those in recent memory, given strong consumer and corporate balance sheets and a still-resilient labor market. Regardless, the probability of a U.S. recession occurring in the next year—even if a mild one—is admittedly tough to handicap right now. Rough odds, we would call it a coin flip.
Investment Takeaways
Conviction is a rare commodity
The bottom line: The macroeconomic backdrop is still rife with uncertainty, and the potential for risk assets to re-test their prior lows leaves us with a preference for more defensive exposures.
This rally may be a good opportunity to reposition into less risky exposures, some of which may now offer potential returns sufficient enough to stay on track toward financial goals.
For example, earlier this week, our Chief Investment Office trimmed equity overweights in exchange for more exposure to core bond duration in the multi-asset portfolios it manages. Still, we think a modest equity overweight is warranted, given that today’s economic conditions and markets are moving faster than what is historically typical. In our view, the stock market is likely to be higher than it is today one to two years from now, even in the event of recession.
Beyond core portfolios, we’re still seeing tactical opportunities, such as putting volatility on our side to add equity exposure with downside protection via structured notes. For more opportunistic investors keen on leaning into risk, we think asset classes such as preferreds and hybrids may be a good first step to do so right now.
Conviction may be a rare commodity in today’s investment environment, but we have it when it comes to our recommendations on portfolio positioning.Our Top Market Takeaways for August 5, 2022.

Take these steps to keep criminals from spoiling your year-end celebrations.It’s the holiday season, and you’re looking forward to vacation getaways, visits with loved ones, exchanging gifts and other festivities.
Just remember as you make your plans: Fraudsters (online and elsewhere) are waiting for you to drop your guard.
Indeed, fraud incident rates typically surge this time of year, and in 2022 they will crown a year of record fraud-related losses. Just with credit cards alone, researchers predict fraudsters will reap $5.72 billion from online, phone and mail-order transactions.
1
These precautions can help you stay safe during the holidays—and beyond.
Watch out for holiday-season scams
Don’t mistakenly transact with fraudsters this holiday season.
Fraudsters enjoyed a profitable 2021, scamming Americans out of $337.5 million with nonpayment/delivery ruses; $172.9 million via credit card frauds; and $98.7 million with bogus advanced fee demands.
2
In addition, fraudsters scammed businesses out of $2.4 billion in revenues, typically using compromised email accounts to redirect legitimate payments to cybercriminals.
3
To protect yourself:
Use trusted travel, reservation and vacation-home rental services
—Validate payment instructions via a telephone number you know to confirm the identity/legitimacy of the party receiving your payment. Use the organization’s secured payment site or credit cards for added security.
Avoid using pre-paid gift cards to pay for holiday purchases
—Fraudsters can drain funds from your card instead of filling your order. If you use a gift card, look for signs of tampering, such as damaged packaging or exposed PINs.
Make charitable donations to established organizations
—Be wary of look-a-like sites. Validate the organization’s web address before sending donations, and confirm there’s a security padlock icon at the start of the URL.
Be alert to physical security threats
Most U.S. households now shop online, driving up the number of package thefts across the country: In 2021 alone, “porch pirates” stole an estimated 210 million packages—valued at more than $5.4 billion—from U.S. homes.
4
And that’s not all: Thieves target packages stowed in vehicles. Some criminals also may attempt to steal them right out of your hands.
To protect yourself:
Redirect deliveries
—Instruct vendors to deliver your purchases to their retail locations or to a secure locker/pickup site instead of to your home. Use delivery tracking to learn when a package is due to arrive.
Remember: Home security systems won’t prevent thieves stealing packages from your front porch.
Be alert to your surroundings and secure your vehicle
—Park in brightly lit areas or ask store/mall security personnel to escort you to your vehicle. Ensure packages left in your car are hidden from view.
Be wary of social media
Last year, consumers reported nearly $770 million in fraud losses via social media, about one-fourth of all reported fraud losses for 2021 and an 18-fold increase from 2017.
5
Fraudsters use social media to identify potential targets, therefore be extremely careful about what you publish online, and urge family members (especially young ones) to do the same.
To protect yourself:
Limit knowledge of your travel or stay-at-home plans
—Don’t disclose your itinerary or “check in” to social media accounts during a trip or while celebrating at home. What you share on social media could lead criminals to your front door or make you a target for scams.
We can help
Just remember, fraudsters want to trick you into
sharing your sensitive information
—or worse, your bank accounts. Don’t let them ruin the fun this holiday season. Learn how to stay a step ahead of fraudsters. If you believe you or a family member is a victim of fraud, immediately contact your J.P. Morgan team. You can also learn more about cybersecurity and fraud prevention

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Latin America is one of the few places in the world where significant portions of farmland remain untapped.Latin America is facing a growing demand for agricultural production and is quickly becoming the breadbasket of the world. Agricultural exports from the region currently account for 16% of total global food and agricultural exports. Accounting for food imports, Latin America’s net exports are 4% and are projected to increase to 19% between 2018-20 and 2030.
1
In order to keep up with growing demand, it is estimated that agricultural production will have to grow 80% by 2050 to meet an expected population increase of more than 35% in the same time period.
2
While the region is one of the few parts of the world with significant resources of unexploited agricultural land, it needs to increase the productivity and sustainability of agricultural practices in order to meet this demand.
3
One of the greatest challenges facing agriculture in Latin America is the fragmentation between large-scale farms with advanced practices and technologies, and smallholder farmers who mainly operate informally and often lack the resources and technology to improve productivity and adopt more sustainable agricultural practices. Agricultural technology (AgTech) holds great promise to address some of these challenges. However, while global investments in AgTech have soared in the last five years and a growing number of start-ups in the region have been set-up to tackle local challenges, investments in the region make up for a very small portion of the global demand.
The unique composition of Latin American agrifood systems and the wide gap separating large and small-scale farmers present challenges and opportunities for investors in the region. Through the use of new technologies large farms can continue to increase their scale and productivity while smallholder farmers can consolidate and improve sustainable practices. However the success of AgTech solutions in Latin America will depend on their uptake by smallholder farmers, to ensure their scalability and implementation. Investing technologies that are tailored correctly for Latin America’s unique agricultural landscape represent an untapped opportunity in the region.
Agriculture is one of Latin America’s largest and fastest growing economic sectors
Latin America accounts for a significant share of global food and agriculture exports. (Figure 1) Brazil is the world’s third largest agricultural exporter after the United States and the European Union, producing most of the world’s sugar, coffee and orange juice, and is the largest exporter of beef, soybeans and poultry. Argentina is the largest exporter of soybean meal and soybean oil in the world, and third in bean exports. Mexico is the third largest agricultural exporter in the region producing vegetables, fruits and other agricultural byproducts.
4
The disruptions in the global food supply chain as a result of COVID19 and recent geopolitical conflicts, coupled with growing local and global demand will need to be met both by small- and large-scale farms, which each play a unique role in producing agricultural goods in the region. Agricultural production in Latin America will have to grow 80% by 2050 to meet an expected population increase of more than 35% in the same time period.
5Figure 1. Latin America is the breadbasket of the world with the highest share of agricultural exports in the world
Net exports of agriculture products by region, 2015-2020 (millions of kilograms)
6Fragmentation between small and large-scale farmers limit the sector’s capacity to keep up with demand
Latin America’s agriculture sector is unique as small-scale farming plays a significant role in the region's food production. The mix between small- and large-scale agriculture varies greatly across countries, leading to disparities in terms of the scale and sophistication of the agricultural sector and its contribution to economic output (Figure 2). While an estimated 50% of total production comes from the region's 14m smallholder farmers, large-scale farms play an essential role in countries like Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay.Figure 2. Small-holder farms hold a large share of farmland across Latin American countries
Average size of small-holder farms in selected Latin American countries (hectares)Sustained agricultural sector growth presents unique challenges to small and large-scale farms
Latin America’s agricultural sector faces productivity and sustainability challenges that need to be addressed in order to deliver on its promise. The sector uses a significant amount of the region’s natural resources, and rising demand for agricultural products will continue to strain the environment. Agriculture uses over one-third of the region’s land area, consumes nearly three-quarters of the region’s fresh water resources, and generates almost one-half of the region’s greenhouse gas emissions.
9
While some farmers and ranchers have been at the forefront of adopting green technology, many Latin American food systems are dominated by production models based on unsustainable practices.
10
These production models threaten the viability of Latin America’s food production capacity and will need to be replaced to ensure the sustainability of the natural resource base.
The global AgTech market is soaring as investors recognise the opportunity that tech solutions offer to transform agricultural systems
Global investors recognise the need of bringing farming from the industrial age into the digital one, in order to increase food yields, reduce the burden to the environment, maintain farm viability and respond to consumer demand for quality foods.
11
Investments in AgTech and FoodTech focus on
efforts to address food waste and improve food traceability, environmental-friendly business models, and enhancement of crop yields sustainably.
12
At the pre-farm stage, technology can, for example, help farmers conduct barter negotiations in a more efficient manner, on-farm tools can help detect irrigation deficiency, identify dead plants, project crop yields, and determine and pinpoint productive or non-productive areas, and finally post-farm tools can help create more competitive marketplaces to buy, trade, and sell agricultural products  and by-products.
13
In addition to the analog AgriFood investments concentrating in genetics, pesticides and fertilisation, supply chain disruptions derived from COVID19, geopolitical instability and labour force shortages have increased investors’ focus on digitisation, data science and alternative farming. Downstream investments which include eGrocery, restaurant marketplaces and home cooking have had the highest rates of growth in the AgriFoodTech sector as they become deeply entrenched in consumer habits.
14
Eighteen percent of consumers now purchase groceries through digital channels more often than in stores.
15
(Figure 3)Figure 3. Investment deals in eGrocers have the greatest share of the market as consumers shift to online stores
2021 Main annual AgriFoodTech investment, by category (% of total investment)Latin American investments in AgriFoodTech trail behind despite its importance for the region’s economic growth
The global AgriFood Tech sector has seen a steady stream of funding over the last decade, reaching a record high of global investments of $51.7bn in 2021. (Figure 4) The US dominates the sector as the world’s biggest AgriFoodTech investment market, with US-based startups raising 41% of all capital and accounting for 34% of deals in 2021. Despite the importance of agriculture in the region and the need for solutions that allow Latin American farmers to deliver on the rising demand for agricultural production, investment opportunities in AgriFood Tech are being overlooked in Latin America. The region ranks last in AgTech investments with just $440m being invested in 152 deals over the last 5 years.
17
Data from the Association for Private Capital Investment in Latin America (LAVCA) shows there was only $35.4 million in venture capital invested in agtechs across 15 disclosed rounds in 2021, leaving ample room for additional investment, which could considerably scale up the market.
18
The only Latin American country that appears among the world’s top-15 is Colombia, in eighth place, with investments of $359 million. The sector raised $70 million last year in Brazil.
19Figure 4. The AgriFoodTech sector has seen a steady stream of investment over the last decade
Upstream and Downstream AgriFoodTech funding (USD billions)The unique challenges of Latin America’s small-holder farmers calls for investments in local-grown solutions
One of the factors that is holding back Latin American investors is the need for the development of solutions that are viable in the highly fragmented agricultural landscape in the region. AgTech innovators in the region face unique challenges derived from the prevalence of small-scale farms including scalability, affordability and limited implementation capabilities. This fragmentation split the regional AgTech investment landscape into two segments. While large-scale farmers might benefit from tech innovations that are being adopted in other parts of the world to improve sustainability and increase crop yields, the small size and lack of production consistency of small-holder farms make it difficult to scale up technology adoption in a big part of the region’s agricultural sector.
The biggest challenge for Latin American startups serving small-holder farmers will be scalability. Innovators will need to promote consistent adoption of technology solutions across a wide variety of actors, with limited resources. In this segment, experts predict that the internet of things (IoT) and the use of APIs to connect very cheap sensors and satellite information that generate intelligent information will be one of the key ways to scale AgTech in the next few years.
21
Improving farmers’ access to financial services could be another growth opportunity at the intersection of AgTech and FinTech, to ensure farmers are able to access the credit needed to modernise their operations. Greater access to financing, through affordable innovative private sector partnerships such as mutual guarantee funds, factoring and other receivables securitization facilities, would help to ease the credit constraints faced by small farmers in Latin America, enabling them to increase their investments and market participation, while introducing new products and technologies to improve their productivity.
Investments in R&D are needed to enable rapid scaling up of local solutions. Spending by the private sector could add significantly to the overall commitment to research and development in Latin America, as well as speed important gains in yield and drought tolerance, pest-resistance, and the potential for improving health by improving nutrient value of crops.
22
Other forms of private sector agriculture investment include research for better irrigation systems, mechanisation for crop production and post-harvest processing and storage, as well as innovation in animal health and nutrition
23
However, the need for more robust IP protections might also be hindering R&D efforts. The system for establishing intellectual property (IP) protection for the companies that are developing these technologies are too slow or almost non- existent in Latin America leading to a withholding of these beneficial technologies from those countries that could benefit farming operations of all sizes.
24
21st century challenges demand 21st century solutions
The viability of Latin America’s agricultural sector depends on its ability to keep up with growing demand and the growing threat of climate change. Transitioning agricultural systems to the digital era can help farmers implement solutions for challenges like waste reduction, increased crop yield and resource consolidation. Latin American investors have the potential to capitalise on the region’s fastest growing sector despite the growth of global investments in AgTech solutions. However, instead of looking outside the region to identify technology innovations and new business models, investors should look inwards and place their bets on solutions that tackle the region’s unique challenges. Technologies that are affordable, scalable and consistently implemented, are more likely to succeed in an industry that is highly fragmented and led by small-holder farmers.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Investors might find income as well as some protection against a recession. Here’s where to look.By any measure, this has been a tumultuous year for investing. (If your portfolio has been buffeted, you’re not alone.) Often in periods of market dislocations, risk-reward calculations shift, and certain potentially attractive investment opportunities may arise. The current environment might allow for equity-like returns in a fixed income portfolio with less risk than in an equity portfolio, given the typically less inherent volatility of the fixed income asset class.
In the first half of 2022 fixed income markets posted some of their worst returns in history. But despite severe market dislocations (and in a sense because of them), two factors could make it possible to achieve equity-like returns in fixed income: higher yields and wider credit spreads (the premium over the yield of a comparable Treasury bond). As a result, the asset class may now offer compelling income returns whatever the economic environment, as well as the potential for capital appreciation if the economy goes into a recession.
We look to combine three key components of the fixed income asset class:
Core carry
—Steady carry (income) with relatively low volatility, as currently found in municipal bonds and short-duration investment-grade (IG) corporate bonds
Portfolio ballast
—Protection against the risk-off market sentiment that typically accompanies a recession, now available in long-duration investment-grade credit and municipal bonds
Higher income
—Higher levels of income, currently on offer in preferred equity and other hybrid securities that combine characteristics of stocks and bonds
1
A fixed income allocation anchored by core carry and including the other two components can potentially achieve equity-like returns with less volatility than stocks. That can be a powerful combination.
Higher policy rates, higher yields
Today’s market dislocations partly reflect the fastest global rate-hiking cycle since the mid-1990s. It began in emerging market (EM) countries, as 12 EM central banks raised rates in 2021. The Bank of England also hiked rates last year.
Then in March 2022, the Federal Reserve (Fed) stepped in with its first hike this cycle, followed by three more hikes so far this year. The market anticipates that the Fed will keep hiking until the fed funds (policy) rate reaches around 3.5% by early 2023. (In mid-2023, investors are pricing rate cuts as the  economy weakens.) As for the European Central Bank (ECB), in July it increased rates for the first time in 11 years.
As central banks have hiked rates and tightened monetary policy, yields across the fixed income landscape have risen substantially year-to-date. Today, investors can potentially achieve forward-looking returns in fixed income that are comparable to the total returns of the S&P 500 since 2000 (roughly 6.7% annually). And fixed income instruments will likely deliver those returns with less volatility than stocks.The key to our positive view on fixed income assets is that we think U.S. Treasury (UST) yields are more likely to head lower than higher from here. We see approximately 3% as the upper end of the long-term fair value range, and expect 10-year USTs to trade below that level for most of a business cycle. In short, we’re probably closer to the end of the Fed’s tightening cycle than the beginning.
Wider spreads, recession protection
Spread levels also offer meaningful compensation for the possibility of debt defaults. The bond market is pricing in slower growth, although not yet fully pricing in a recession. As a result, credit spreads are wider than historical averages. Especially in the preferred and hybrid space, these spreads now offer protection against a significant economic downturn.Focus on the three key components of fixed income
Amid these market crosscurrents, investors may  explore using a mix of fixed income assets to seek equity-like expected returns while looking to minimize risk.
In the search for equity-like returns, investors can focus on three key components of fixed income:
1. Core carry
—Municipal bonds and short-duration investment-grade corporate bonds offer the most attractive carry, or income. Their current yields are in the 4%–5% range¹ with low volatility. Added to a portfolio, they can provide capital preservation and steady income returns. In our view, core carry holdings should make up the lion’s share of a fixed income allocation that looks to achieve equity-like returns with less volatility.2. Ballast
—Long-dated, U.S. investment-grade credit and municipal bonds offer portfolio protection against an economic downturn. That’s because they act as a hedge in a recession: As economic growth slows, central banks cut policy rates and the prices of long-dated bonds (Treasuries, IG and municipals) tend to rise. At the same time, the prices of risk assets such as stocks tend to fall.
Although the economy could still reach a soft landing, recessions odds have clearly risen in recent months. Long-dated municipals and IG bonds can thus provide a hedge to other asset classes in a risk-off environment that typically accompanies a recession.3. Higher income
—
As spreads have widened dramatically this year, preferreds and hybrids now provide compelling yields of around 7%.
Unlike other types of extended credit (such as high yield), preferreds and hybrids are more likely to have negligible default rates. This reflects the fact that the underlying issuers are typically highly regulated investment-grade companies. That’s a benefit for investors.
On the other hand, investors may also take on meaningful interest rate risk in owning hybrids. This reflects the fact that hybrids are perpetual securities which are especially sensitive to changes in interest rates (as rates move lower, prices rise and vice versa). This seems to be a manageable risk, given our view that interest rates will likely move lower over the next 24 months.
Hybrids could also offer some capital appreciation potential, as markets assign a greater value to these securities’ relatively low default rates.
Although past performance is no guarantee of future results, in analyzing weekly data since 2012 for the preferred/hybrids market (the HIPS Index), these statistics are telling:
When spreads are greater than 400 basis points (bps), median one-year forward excess returns have exceeded
20%.
When spreads are greater than 300 bps, median one-year forward excess returns have exceeded 13%.
Given current spread levels of ~400 bps, this analysis indicates potential for equity-like performance in the preferred/hybrid space over the coming year.
Combining with core carry and portfolio ballast, the higher income of preferreds/hybrids can lead to a formidable fixed income allocation that delivers stock-like returns with far less volatility. Amid the churn of today’s dislocated markets, promising investment opportunities may be found.
We can help
In tumultuous markets, it is important to consider a wide array of investment options. Your J.P. Morgan team can help you evaluate what fixed income strategies may be considered to help you achieve your long-term goals.1
Preferred equity is a type of equity that ranks senior in the capital structure to common equity, pays a fixed dividend (like a bond coupon) and does not mature (it is a perpetual security). A hybrid security is subordinated debt, senior to preferred equity in the capital structure, issued by utilities, telecoms and insurers, among others. Hybrids tend to have very long maturities (usually north of 60 years), with coupons that reset at defined periods. Both preferreds and hybrids are typically issued by investment-grade companies.This chart shows the yield of the different fixed income markets represented by either the corresponding benchmark security or the corresponding index as well as the historical annual return since 12/31/1999 (inclusive of dividends reinvested in the index) of the S&P 500 as well as the Long Term Capital Market Assumptions for equity returns of US Large Capitalization Equity from J.P.

This week, the S&P 500 briefly touched 4,300 before falling off its high. The FOMC minutes released on Wednesday revealed that the committee is well-aware of the risk of overtightening as policy rates reached neutral levels. However, inflation is still a long way from the Fed’s two percent target, wage growth
may stay sticky
given the resilient labor market, and the broad-based risk asset rally has helped undo a decent amount of overall tightening – the combination of which may prompt the central bank to keep rates at restrictive levels “for some time”

. This is in line with our view that the risk/reward of equities from here looks less attractive and we prefer core bonds.
In Europe, stagflationary worries are top of mind. Eurozone Q2 GDP disappointed, suggesting slowing momentum across the continent. UK CPI hit 10.1% in July, the highest since 1982, and markets now expect the Bank of England (BOE) to double its policy rate by February next year. Overall we remain cautious on European assets, and see opportunities in select high quality bank papers providing attractive yields.
In Asia, offshore Chinese equities were pressured by risks in the property sector, sluggish earnings and concerns over tech regulations. This week’s Strategy Question is focused on one of the biggest challenges facing the Chinese economy…
Strategy Question: When will China’s housing market bottom?
Latest developments
China’s economy is showing signs of a hard landing. Mounting pain and losses in the real estate sector, a broad loss of confidence among consumers, and businesses putting investment on hold are causing a sharp drop in economic activity despite stimulus efforts aimed at boosting infrastructure investment. China’s post-Covid economy has been stuck in a very lopsided growth path, with exports the lone bright spot in a hark back to pre “rebalancing” days. With global growth set to turn weaker, and global consumers turning away from spending on goods towards services, this boost may soon fade.
We highlighted in our
mid-year outlook
that the path of recovery in China would be bumpy. After a relatively strong June boosted by supply chain resumptions and pent-up demand as lockdowns lifted, July economic data released early this week disappointed across the board. While the slowdown was broad-based, weakness centered in the service sector and the housing market. Service activities continued to be pressured by lingering Covid impact, and homebuyer confidence deteriorated due to the mortgage non-payment issue in July. As a result, housing sales weakened further (-28% y/y) after a brief rebound in June, and contracted sales data published by developers suggested a wider divergence between state-owned firms and private players. Housing investment continued to plummet (-12.1% y/y vs 9.7% in June).We discussed in the outlook that a sizable policy stimulus would be key to shaping the recovery in the second half of this year, and over the past months, we’ve seen policy support pick up on the fiscal front. Infrastructure investment notably increased amidst a broad deceleration of business capex (see the chart below). On the monetary front, the PBOC surprised the market with a 10bps MLF cut this Monday, and a further cut in five-year LPR (linked to mortgage rates) is now widely expected
2
.However, while policy support has been incremental, the overall very weak confidence across the private sector and households is now overwhelming stimulus efforts. Simply put, infrastructure is not enough. Over the past few months we’ve seen a significant decline in corporate medium and long term lending as well as household loans (i.e. mortgages). Credit data in July was again a big surprise to the downside despite ample liquidity in the banking system, suggesting that the already fragile sentiment further weakened due to renewed risks in the property sector. It raises the question of how effective further rate cuts can be without a fundamental boost in underlying demand.In other words, the stimulus is still overly focused on the supply side rather than the demand side. Beijing has focused on boosting liquidity, lower rates, tax rebates, and improved logistics. This has worked to the extent that global demand has remained strong and China’s supply stimulus could deliver cheap exports. However, domestic demand has remained weak, causing most of the private sector to hold back. Until policy shifts towards treating this demand deficit, it’s hard to see a substantial turnaround any time soon.
An emerging crisis of confidence
The larger risk is a collapse in confidence that creates a further downward spiral. China’s economy has been buoyed by years of unabated confidence in the future. Consumers spent because they had faith that their future incomes would be higher, property sales soared on expectations prices would continue their unrelenting rise, and businesses invested on the view that growth was the top priority of the government and, crucially, that the government would step in whenever growth faltered. Guiding expectations with high-growth targets and bolstering confidence with regular rounds of stimulus provided the backdrop for continued growth. Despite the private sector taking up a larger and growing share of the economy, it was these signals from Beijing that guided the economic cycle.
And now these signals have shifted. Covid Zero has remained the clear priority of the government, and was just reaffirmed at the recent Politburo meetings. This policy impacts growth in two ways: first, rolling lockdowns are causing consumer confidence to plummet, pushing consumers towards reducing spending. Second, the uncertainty caused by rolling lockdowns is causing businesses, especially the private sector, to forego investment. This intuitively makes sense, as businesses require certainty over the path of policy and the economic cycle before investing to expand or hire. As the main driver of fixed asset investment and the largest employer, private enterprises cutting back this sharply is a strong warning sign. Taken together, the economy appears to be suffering from a sharp drop in confidence that is filtering through to weaker economic activity across the board. We published weeks ago saying China needed a substantial stimulus program that could reverse this downward slide, but so far the actions have been piecemeal. The problem is now more serious – requiring a larger and swifter policy response. Should that not materialize, China is facing a higher likelihood of a sharper slowdown.More structural than cyclical – the growth model is out of runway
China has been able to avoid anything resembling a normal business cycle since the global financial crisis due to near constant counter-cyclical stimulus, predominantly delivered through the property sector. Every time China slowed (which it did in 2009, 2012, and 2015), money supply spiked, credit growth increased, property sales and construction boomed and growth picked up overall.
This model now appears to have run its course. Beijing rightly know this – and it’s a key reason why they are targeting property developers with the three red lines, and why senior policy makers repeat the mantra “property is for living, not for speculation.” There are significant constraints on all the old policy tools: monetary loosening would either exacerbate existing property price bubbles (which are already the most expensive in the world) or liquidity would flow offshore creating further currency depreciation pressure. Fiscal policy directed at infrastructure risks creating additional bad debts.
There are few, if any, low hanging fruit, in the sense that most infrastructure projects that could create a positive economic return have already been built. Capital is abundant, the shortage is in productive projects. The injection of infrastructure stimulus is likely to further increase the debt/GDP ratio, something policy makers have been loath to do. Furthermore, infrastructure has never been enough to turn the cycle, which has been primarily driven by property and exports. The property market simply matters more: spending on real estate flows through to more parts of the economy (including both upstream raw materials and downstream consumer goods) than spending in other sectors – giving it a unique force in driving the business cycle. Research by the Asian Development Bank also shows the importance of real estate. According to its calculations the value-added multiplier for real estate was the highest among all sectors, meaning it’s hard to turn around the cycle without a boost from property.
A closer look at the property slowdown
In our beginning of the year outlook we specifically cited China property as one of the biggest potential growth risks, and asserted that policymakers would have a tough task avoiding a loss of confidence and downward spiral in sales and prices. It now looks like that downward spiral is upon us. Following the initial spurt after Omicron lockdowns were lifted, property sales have further declined near their all-time lows. Property prices, especially for existing properties, are turning down sharply. Land sales are also cratering, sapping a key source of financing for local governments, and a key reason why any stimulus will be subdued.Part of the slowdown is policy induced, resulting from policy makers cracking down on developer financing, but a key part is structural. Policymaker actions could be considered a response to the structural unsustainability of China’s housing model.
Years of excesses have built up. On the developer side, they relied on the pre-sale model to pursue rapid growth, particularly using pre-sales to plug financing gaps whenever domestic liquidity tightened. However, developers sold vastly more properties than they completed. According to official data, the amount of sold but uncompleted properties in the current construction pipeline is staggering at nearly 700 million square meters (see chart). This is the crux of the
mortgage non-repayment
issue and the scale of yet-to-be-completed properties suggests it’s a large hole that needs to be filled. Assuming bailouts eventually allow these to be completed and delivered, that simply represents money that can’t be spent on stimulus elsewhere. Even with this level of unfinished properties, excess supply remains a serious problem. Recent data points to a vacancy rate of 7% in tier-one cities including Beijing, and 12% in tier-two cities, the China household Finance Survey puts it at 21.4% in 2017, and the official data puts it at 25 months’ worth of sales. Averaging across these suggests a vacancy rate that is substantially higher than the global average. Furthermore, these same surveys show that over 70% of purchases since 2018 were by buyers who already owned one or more apartments, meaning the vast majority of purchases were for investment or speculative purposes. This sharp rise in speculative buying was a key reason prices sharply increased in 2015-2016, and a big reason policymakers eventually cracked down on the sector. Turning to prices, on a price-to-income basis China has the most expensive house prices in the world. And importantly, this is a recent phenomenon. The massive monetary stimulus and money supply increase from the 2015-2016 period caused house prices in many cities to
double
over a 12 month time horizon. These bubbles are a key concern for policy makers (hence the ‘property is for living’ mantra) and a key reason why they can’t stimulate in any large way.The music is now stopping as they say. Developers have massive liabilities they can’t meet. Excess construction created the world’s highest vacancy rate, and massive speculation created the most expensive housing markets in the world. This is all a result of 10+ years of easy money flowing into housing as the primary engine to boost growth. The excesses of ten years of printed money flowing into this sector has created a systemic risk that policymakers are now intent on addressing. Now that the taps are turned off, unsustainable developers are going bust and speculative buying is being removed. The broad real estate sector – which estimates put at 20-30% of GDP – is deleveraging and shrinking down to a more sustainable size. For context, the U.S. property sector at its height prior to the GFC was approximately 18% of GDP. While efforts at deleveraging the sector makes sense, shrinking the world’s largest sector and the world’s largest asset class entails significant risks and tradeoffs. Avoiding a sustained economic decline could be challenging. Nonetheless, policymakers could step in and stem the rapid decline by restoring confidence and bringing back the natural demand (for example new homebuyers, upgraders) that is now on the sidelines.
What does a policy response look like?
The basic characteristics of a credible plan can be simply stated: it needs to be central rather than local, and large not small. More direct involvement by the central government would be a change, as the central government has so far consistently indicated that local governments should take the lead on real estate issues. So far this is the extent of policy responses -- targeted actions on the local government level. On July 20 the municipal government of Zhengzhou (one of the cities with the most unfinished projects), introduced a targeted relief strategy prioritizing seven top developers and RMB 100 billion bail-out funds to facilitate housing delivery. A few other cities made soft promises to address the issue. So far we haven’t seen concrete support measures from the central government, which might be due to a limited policy space and an unwillingness to reverse course on policies aimed at shrinking the property sector. Much like Zero Covid policies, changing paths is more difficult than most assume. As we mentioned above, these targeted remediations have not seemed to help restore overall confidence, as indicated by the July data.
Finishing properties and delivering them to homebuyers, facilitating the orderly unwind or merger of unsustainable developers, and putting property on a sustainable growth path could restore confidence and allow the economy to avoid a sharper collapse. A credible plan has yet to emerge. Eventually it will, but the longer it takes the larger the risks become.
What does this mean for markets, both in Asia and globally?
At the moment it is hard to predict when the property sector will bottom. We don’t expect a clear rebound in the sector for the remainder of this year. We recently downgraded our outlook for 2022 GDP to 3.1% from 3.9%, taking into account further downside risks in the property sector. We also remain below consensus for next year at 5.0%. From here, we are likely to see a pickup in policy support in response to the weakness in data. However, there is no easy fix to the weakness in underlying demand, and further stimulus may not be as effective without a clear roadmap to exit the Covid Zero policy.
For investors, we remain patient on Chinese equities while we await stronger policy actions to restore confidence. In terms of the RMB, we’ve been bearish on the currency since April given the now negative carry against the U.S. Dollar. For clients who have RMB exposure, we think it makes sense to hedge at current levels. Strong exports and a strong balance of payments have been a key support for the CNH. But as growth across developed economies decelerates, that strength could fade over time. In addition, capital flows tend to be well correlated to property prices, with prices now in decline there is a chance capital outflows pick up putting further downward pressure on the currency. In addition, the PBOC’s easing bias may create a larger divergence in policy direction with most of the major DM central banks.  The global impact of a struggling Chinese economy is generally felt through commodities and sentiment. China-driven commodities could see further downside, especially because property investment is the key driver of commodity demand. European companies could see fewer capital goods exports and lower corporate earnings. However, the global impact is fairly concentrated, and despite being the world’s second largest economy, China’s role as a global consumer is much smaller than its role as a global producer (except in commodities).Sources:

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.A brief guide to the key legal and tax considerationsIn addition to its appeal as a holiday destination, Switzerland is attractive to foreigners because of its political and legal stability, low crime rate, excellent medical facilities and the quality of its educational and cultural offering. There continues to be significant demand from non-residents seeking to acquire property in Switzerland and its real estate market has enjoyed stability and growth. This note provides a brief overview of the key legal and tax considerations that are relevant for non-residents considering purchasing real estate in Switzerland.
The legal restrictions
The purchase of real estate in Switzerland by non-residents has been restricted since the 1960s. Over the years, these rules have been subject to various changes and liberalizations. Today, these rules are set forth in the “Federal Law on the Acquisition of Real Estate by Persons Abroad”, also known as the Lex Koller. The Lex Koller restricts the purchase of certain types of real estate in Switzerland by foreigners, foreign-based companies and Swiss-based companies controlled by foreigners (referred to collectively herein as “non-residents”). There is another important restriction which is known as the Lex Weber. Enacted in 2013 following a referendum narrowly passed in 2012, this act limits the number of secondary residences in tourist areas to a maximum of 20%.
In this note we focus primarily on the Lex Koller which imposes the principal restrictions on foreigners seeking to buy Swiss real estate. Under the Lex Koller, non-resident individuals are defined as:
Foreign nationals living outside Switzerland.
Foreign nationals living in Switzerland who are neither citizens of the European Union (“EU”) nor European Free Trade Association (“EFTA”) member states, nor Swiss permanent residents (holders of C residence permits).
This note focuses on foreign nationals living outside Switzerland.
As for legal entities, the Lex Koller considers entities to be non-residents if they are:
Incorporated abroad, even if they are held by Swiss citizens.
Registered in Switzerland but under foreign control, whether corporations or partnerships. Foreign control applies when non-residents hold more than one-third of the capital of the company or have more than one-third of the voting rights. Moreover, foreign control is assumed when non-residents provide significant debt capital to an entity.
The Lex Koller distinguishes several types of real estate including (i) primary residences, (ii) holiday homes and (iii) commercial properties.
Primary residences
In general, non-resident foreign individuals may not purchase land and/or property to use as a primary residence.
Holiday homes
A non-resident may acquire a holiday home in Switzerland upon receipt of an authorization from the canton where the property is located. The purchase must also fall within the annual permit quota for the relevant canton and commune. Across Switzerland, 1,500 quotas for holiday homes may be issued to non-residents annually. This quota is allocated annually by the Swiss government based on a number of factors including the number of tourism facilities and new developments.
The canton must also have a law permitting foreign ownership of holiday properties and must have clearly defined the regions where these acquisitions are possible. Such holiday homes are generally limited to a maximum net floor space of 200m2 and 1,000m2 of land (in accordance with current practice, up to 250m2/1,500m2 will be granted if the need is demonstrated). Higher limits may be approved exceptionally. For this purpose, net floor space includes all liveable space, hallways, hobby rooms, saunas and indoor swimming pools. Balconies, stairwells, cellars and attics are not taken into account for this calculation.
Non-residents may only acquire a holiday home in their own name – in other words, acquisition through an entity is not allowed. Moreover, the holiday home may only be rented out occasionally on a limited basis. A non-resident is only allowed to have one holiday home in Switzerland – for this purpose a holiday home owned by a spouse/registered partner as well as children under 18 will be taken into account.
Secondary residences
There are two limited exceptions whereby a non-resident may acquire a secondary residence in Switzerland. First, an EU or EFTA citizen who commutes crossborder to work in Switzerland may acquire a secondary residence in the area of his place of work subject to certain limitations. Second, in certain cantons, a non-resident may be authorized to acquire a secondary residence in Switzerland on the basis of exceptionally close economic, scientific or cultural ties that are worthy of protection. This exception is extremely limited and we note that relationships to persons in Switzerland – through blood or marriage – as well as study, recuperation or holiday stays do not constitute exceptional ties.
Commercial properties
There are no restrictions for non-residents buying real estate for commercial purposes. A commercial property is not required to be used for the buyer’s business and may be rented out to a third party. Moreover, commercial real estate may be purchased solely for investment purposes.
Taxes
Real estate transfer tax
A real estate transfer tax may be levied by the cantons and/or municipalities on the purchase price of real estate and is normally payable by the buyer. The amount of the tax varies from one canton to another but generally ranges from 1% to 3.3%.
Certain cantons, such as Zurich and Zug, do not impose real estate transfer tax (but in practice this is often compensated with higher charges for registering the transaction in the property register).
Property tax
Property tax is levied annually by certain cantons or municipalities on the full taxable value of the property, without taking into account any property financing or mortgage. It is due by the owner recorded in the land registry. Generally the property tax rate is 0.01–0.03%.
Income tax and wealth tax
All owners of Swiss real estate, including non-residents, are subject to an annual income tax on the “deemed rental income” of the property. This “deemed rental value” is regularly estimated by the municipal or cantonal authorities. The income tax rates vary from canton to canton and from municipality to municipality.
In addition, non-residents owning Swiss real estate are subject to annual wealth tax. All cantons and communes levy a wealth tax based on net wealth. From a real estate point of view, net wealth corresponds to the “taxable” value of the property (generally a discount of the real value) less debts (mortgages) for wealth tax reasons.
Capital gains taxes
The sale of real estate situated in Switzerland that is held directly (in other words, not through an entity) will generally trigger capital gains tax at the cantonal level and sometimes also at the municipal level. The taxable gain is calculated on the basis of the difference between the sale price and the acquisition price, including the cost of alterations. Tax rates vary greatly by canton, and effective tax rates are predominantly influenced by the amount of the gain, the location of the real estate and the length of time the seller has held the property. Notably, there are surcharges for short holding periods that could lead to high profits realized over a short period being taxed at a rate higher than 50%. We note that some cantons have minimum holding periods – generally five years – during which property owned by a non-resident may not be resold.
Inheritance and gift taxes
Upon the non-resident owner’s death, or if an owner gifts the real estate during his lifetime, inheritance/gift tax may be due based on the property’s value at the time of the death/gift. The tax is to be paid by the heir/donee as the case may be. Swiss inheritance tax and gift tax is levied by the cantons and, in some cases, the municipalities (not at the federal level). While rates and laws vary, all cantons exempt a surviving spouse from inheritance and gift taxes and most cantons also exempt direct descendants from such taxes. Canton Schwyz and Canton Obwalden levy neither inheritance nor gift taxes and Canton Lucerne levies no gift taxes on gifts made at least five years before death.
While Swiss tax may be due upon the transfer of the property for tax purposes we note that from an inheritance law perspective, Swiss law, including the Swiss forced heirship rules, should not apply in the case of a non-resident of Switzerland holding Swiss real estate at his death. Rather the laws of the country of the deceased’s last place of domicile should be consulted.
Transactional steps
The transactional aspects of entering into a contract to purchase real estate in Switzerland are relatively straightforward. The notary plays an important role as all agreements relating to the sale of real estate must be notarized in order to be valid. First, a letter of intent will be signed by the parties, outlining the terms of the transaction and the purchaser will also make a deposit which typically is received by the real estate broker or the notary. If needed, the notary will then apply to the cantonal property office for a permit to purchase the property. Finally, the contract of sale must be signed by the notary, seller and the buyer. Transfer of ownership only takes effect when the new owner has been entered into the land registry.

The information provided in this note remains brief and is intended to flag some of the issues to be considered in the case of a non-resident acquiring Swiss real estate. J.P. Morgan recommends purchasers to seek tax and legal counsel both in Switzerland and in the purchaser’s home country.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Freezing your credit is a simple but strong shield against identity thieves. Discover how to prevent identity theft and freeze your credit now.Identity theft has become a multibillion-dollar global industry thanks to cybercriminals mining the treasure trove of consumer information easily found on social media;
1
obtaining information through social engineering schemes;
2
and harvesting data from breaches at companies large and small worldwide.
For the individual victims, however, it may take years to recover from fraudulent use(s) of their personal information.
Make protecting your personal information a top financial goal for 2022. To protect yourself, and your family, be proactive: Take the time to understand the scope of the problem and to review your individual vulnerabilities. Then take action. Start by freezing your credit—so unauthorized accounts and lines of credit cannot be opened in your name. Other key protective moves are recommended below.
Understand your risks
To begin assessing your vulnerabilities, ask yourself:
How can fraudsters get access to my personal information?
In many cases, you give it to them: by responding to a social engineering scheme; shopping on a duped website; clicking on a link in an online ad; posting personal information on social media.
What information do cybercriminals value?
Cybercriminals target your bank account/bank card number, birth date and your Tax ID, which in the United States, would be your Social Security number. Also desirable: your maiden name/mother’s maiden name, driver’s license number, home address, and online user name and passwords. Using varying combinations of this information, criminals can steal funds from you and/or another person or entity—a retailer, government agency, financial institution.
Won’t I know if someone steals my identity?
Not necessarily. It may be months before you learn
2
that your identity has been stolen—unless you subscribe to a fraud monitoring service, or regularly check each of your credit reports
3
for unauthorized transactions. Optimally, this should be done every quarter and with each credit bureau, as information will vary in each report.
Doesn’t discovering a data theft stop the problem?
No. Once a scammer has your personal information, they can continue to use it and/or sell it. There’s an active market for personal data on the dark web,
4
where buyers and sellers trade information anonymously. Sophisticated criminals will aim to compile a more robust profile of you/your family members with information gleaned from social media
5
and other sources.
How might a fraudster use my identity?
The list is long. A few fraud crimes recently reported by several J.P. Morgan clients included an application for a disaster loan; another for unemployment benefits; and a third to add a new signer to their accounts. In a fourth instance, fraudulent tax returns were filed.
Who’s at risk?
Trends vary by country. In the United States it’s anyone with a Social Security number, with the very young and the very old among the most vulnerable. Children, because their credit history is a blank slate; seniors, because they may be more trusting and less likely to detect or report fraudsters.
Protect yourself and your family
While you can’t avoid all risks, doing these three simple things right now will help limit access to your personal information:
1.       Freeze your credit.
Also known as a “security freeze,” this stops merchants and institutions from routinely accessing your credit report, thereby making it more difficult for criminals to open accounts in your name or abuse your credit. A security freeze does not affect your credit score.
Keep in mind:
You must request a freeze from each individual credit bureau. Do the same for every family member. For instructions on how to freeze your credit,
click here
. (Institutions can often tell you which credit bureau they will check during the loan application. You can unfreeze it if you are seeking a loan and refreeze your credit after the check is complete.)
2.
Review your credit reports.
Request a copy of your credit report directly from the leading credit bureaus in your country. Be on the lookout for unauthorized activities—account openings, transactions, etc.
Keep in mind
: The information on each report may differ. For a deeper view going forward, consider reviewing all reports each quarter. Do the same for all family members.
3.
Subscribe to a credit monitoring service.
Get alerts whenever changes are made to your credit history, such as credit applications/credit account openings; address or name changes to your credit file; public record notices, such as bankruptcy filings. Some services also monitor the dark web for your Social Security number, email address and/or passwords.
Keep in mind:
These services do not prevent identity theft, protect you from security breaches or warn if someone files a tax return in your name and collects your refund.

.
And always, evaluate before you act.
If you receive a request to provide personal or financial information, take a step back from the situation to evaluate it. Even if the requestor claims to be your bank or other trusted organization, don’t rush to action!

, Head of Tax Advisory, Advice Lab
Adam Ludman
, Tax Advisory, Advice Lab
Cheyenne Del Savio
, Tax Advisory, Advice Lab
As the end of the year approaches, it is wise to consider how you might save on your tax bill using a strategy known as “tax-loss harvesting.”
This strategy—which can be particularly powerful when markets have been volatile—involves realizing capital losses with the intention of using them to offset your realized capital gains, thereby lowering your tax bill for the year.
1
There can be significant benefits to harvesting losses. But make sure you do not run afoul of the so-called “wash sale” rule, which can be complicated to navigate. Thus, be mindful of common pitfalls to avoid disrupting your careful planning.
What is the wash sale rule?
The wash sale rule prohibits taxpayers from claiming a loss on the sale or other disposition of a stock or securities if, within the 61-day period that begins 30 days before the sale (generally, the trade date) or other disposition, they:
Acquire the same or a “substantially identical” stock or securities; or
Enter a contract to acquire stock or securities (e.g., call options)
The wash sale rule also applies to short sales.
2
The wash sale rule exists to prevent taxpayers from taking losses (thus lowering their tax bill) when they are not economically out of a particular position for a sufficient period of time.
Consequences of running afoul of the wash sale rule can be significant:
The loss from the sale of the original shares is disallowed
The amount of the disallowed loss is added to the basis of the newly acquired shares, and realized only when the newly acquired position is sold
Additionally, the taxpayer’s holding period on the original shares is added to the holding period of the newly acquired shares
To illustrate:
On June 1, 2022, Tom sold 100 shares of ABC stock for $100 a share, initially purchased for $110 each. He held the shares for more than one year (long-term). Thus, his capital loss was $1,000 (100 shares @ $10 per share). On June 10, 2022, Tom repurchased 100 shares of ABC stock for $105 a share. Since the wash sale rule applies:
The $1,000 loss would be disallowed
The $1,000 would be added to the cost basis of the new shares, and the new cost basis would be $115 per share ($105 per share + $10 per share disallowed loss)
These newly purchased shares are considered to be held long-term because of the holding period of the original sharesWhen does the wash sale rule apply?
The wash sale rule applies to transactions in stock or securities, including debt securities, and contracts to acquire stocks or securities.
This includes, for example, warrants, convertible preferred stock and options contracts. It is not clear, however, whether the rule covers some common financial instruments, such as equity swaps. So, you must work closely with your tax advisor to confirm whether or not a particular transaction may give rise to a wash sale.
Another key determination is whether two securities are “substantially identical”; but, the wash sale rule uses this term without precisely defining it. Ultimately, a taxpayer must consider the economics of the two positions. (Again, with the assistance of your tax advisor.)
One widely cited case suggests a taxpayer should ask, generally, whether a knowledgeable investor, fully armed with all relevant facts, would discern a sufficiently material economic difference between two positions such that her decision making would prejudice her toward one position over the other.
3
If the answer to this question is “no,” the two positions are likely substantially identical—and, therefore, the wash sale rule could apply, even though the pair of transactions involved two different securities.
Unfortunately, there is no bright line test and the determination of what is substantially identical requires an analysis of the specific facts and circumstances. For example, for two debt securities of the same issuer not to be considered identical, the securities’ other features (e.g., coupon, maturity, call features, degree of subordination, etc.) would have to be different enough that they created a difference in the economics of the two positions.
In applying the wash sale rule, you should also be aware of trading activity in your other accounts. The wash sale rule could apply to transactions in any account you (or related parties) have with another financial institution, including retirement accounts; accounts held by your disregarded entity (e.g., single member LLC) or grantor trust; or accounts held by your spouse.
Make sure to also watch out for vesting and the exercise of compensatory options or restricted stock grants and automatic dividend reinvestments, which qualify as the acquisition of stock for purposes of the wash sale rule.
What types of transactions could trigger the wash sale rule?
Always consult your tax advisor before you engage in transactions that might be considered a wash sale. However, it can be helpful to understand where the rule could apply.Selling an active manager at a loss and buying a different active manager
Selling an active strategy at a loss and buying a passive strategy (or vice versa)Selling allocated gold at a loss and buying another allocated or unallocated position (or vice versa)
4
Buying a lot and selling a part of that same lot at a loss within 30 days, if no other lots have been purchased
Buying a new lot and liquidating the entire position at a loss within 30 days (without a subsequent transaction that might trigger the wash sale rule within the wash sale window period)
Selling a position at a loss within 30 days of receiving a gift of that positionSelling a position in one account and buying it back in another account with the same or another financial Institution
Selling a position in a taxable account and buying it back in your IRA (here, the loss would be lost completely, because the position in the IRA has no basis)
Selling a position at a loss in your account, then your spouse buying it back in their account (even if your spouse files separately, the loss may be disallowed)
Selling a position at a loss and buying it back in a disregarded entity you own (such as a single-member LLC) or a grantor trust (or vice versa)
Selling a position at a loss and a partnership or corporation you control buying it back (or vice versa)
Selling a position at a loss and acquiring a call option or writing a deep-in-the-money put option on the same position
Selling a stock at a loss and acquiring new shares due to automatic dividend reinvestment
Selling a stock at a loss within 30 days of a restricted stock/restricted stock units (RSUs) vesting or an exercise of compensatory optionsAlternatively, if you want to hold the same stock or securities and do not want to be out of the market for an entire month, you can “double up” on your position. For example, buy the identical position at the current price by November 29, wait 30 days, then sell the original loss position on Friday, December 30, and potentially recognize the loss this year.
We can help
All of your tax moves should be thoroughly discussed with your tax advisors.
While J.P. Morgan does not provide legal or tax advice (and cannot opine on whether a particular transaction is a wash sale), your J.P. Morgan team can help you and your tax advisors assess potential tax-loss harvesting opportunities. You may also benefit from having a so-called “separate, tax-managed account”—i.e., one designed to continuously look for losses and harvest them when opportunities arise.
To learn more about our capabilities, please contact your J.P. Morgan team.1
Please consult your tax advisor to see if tax-loss harvesting is available with your accounts, and how potential buybacks may be done successfully. Taxes should not be the only factor to drive an investment decision.

The wash sale rule does not currently apply to direct investment in assets other than stock or securities, including commodities (such as allocated gold), currencies or digital assets (such as cryptocurrency). Recent proposals in Congress to expand the scope of assets subject to the wash sale rule beyond “securities” did not pass. So at this time, the wash sale rule still does not apply to certain assets that historically fall outside its scope.This is meant to provide an illustration of the taxation of a security trade where the wash sale loss disallowance rules are invoked.Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.

Sarah Brody, Donor-Advised Fund Specialist
Charitable giving in the United States has grown considerably over the past 40 years. However, during economic recessions, we often see a decrease in philanthropic funds.
This year has been marked by inflation, headwinds from the pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine. These factors, along with social and environmental issues, are intensifying the need for charitable support across the country and the world.
Foundations and nonprofits are preparing for the impacts these types of events will have on their organizations because historically when the economy has incurred challenges, it has taken several years for the philanthropic sector to recover. In the
Chronicle of Philanthropy
, Shannon McCracken, CEO of the Nonprofit Alliance, recently shared “The year’s end is such a critical fundraising period for nearly everyone. Some of these unknowns over the past two months have really put a pause on spending [for nonprofits] and caused everyone to go back and re-budget for different scenarios.”
Today, strategic and intentional donors can follow three steps to provide much-needed stability for the nonprofits they care most about while maximizing their charitable impacts.
First, evaluate your giving history
When gifting resources are limited, it’s important to determine your giving goals and decide your top priorities.
Reflect on these questions:
What organizations do you want to continue to support?
Do you have the capacity to add new causes to your giving strategy?
Do you see the impact of your time or resources in the areas you care most about?
Your answers can be helpful in solidifying your mission and ensuring you are supporting the organizations most significant to you—this may mean donating to fewer organizations, but making larger, multi-year gifts to those nonprofits. These types of gifts can provide nonprofits with the financial support and safety nets they need to maintain existing programming and plan for the future.
Strategize and develop a plan
Once you have decided which organizations you want to give to, research or reach out to discuss their needs. Nonprofits can be forced to decide between scaling back programs, changing expansion plans and potentially laying off employees. It’s imperative to understand their challenges and priorities for the future.
Key considerations to assess are:
How has the current economic state impacted the organization?
What are the most important initiatives for the organization, and where do they align with your interests?
Is the organization thinking creatively to plan for the future?
These questions will help you approach the final step in the process: finalizing how you will give.
Evaluate your balance sheet and give
Once you have established your strategic goals, it is time to determine which assets will best support your intentions. Exploring your entire balance sheet will allow you to both fund your giving plans and maximize the tax benefits you can receive in the process.
Ask your attorney and tax advisor for help evaluating the potential tax benefits of these strategies:
1.
Gift long-term appreciated securities
Giving highly appreciated, long-term securities directly to a charity or charitable vehicle can be a tax-efficient way to support your philanthropy. You may be able to eliminate capital gains taxes on the unrealized appreciation
and
receive a deduction based on the fair market value of the gifted asset.
While most asset class returns are negative year-to-date, many securities still have significant embedded gains on a multi-year basis.
Take it one step further:
Amplify your philanthropic vision by applying a values-based lens to your donations. Are there holdings in your portfolio that do not align with your charitable mission? Tax-efficiently divest by donating these holdings to fund your philanthropy. We worked with one donor to give to cancer research and several healthcare nonprofits using funds from an appreciated position in a tobacco company.
2.
Donate nontraditional and illiquid assets
Do you own long-term assets outside of your portfolio that have appreciated significantly?
Some nonprofits and sophisticated donor-advised funds (DAFs) may accept complex assets as gifts, such as real estate, alternative investments or privately held business interests. Unlocking nontraditional areas of your balance sheet can help you achieve your philanthropy goals.
For example:
We worked with a client’s family to facilitate the contribution of a hedge fund interest to their DAF. This strategy allowed the donors to receive a fair market value deduction for their gift and avoid realizing the capital gain. Since making this donation, the donors have used their DAF to benefit various nonprofits, including several in the education space, that were unlikely to directly take in a complex asset.
3. Harvest losses and donate cash
Consider whether there are positions in your portfolio that you can
tax-loss harvest
. By selling an investment at a loss, you can offset capital gains and income in the current year or future. While cash donations don’t offer the same strategic tax advantage of appreciated assets for “gifting the gain,” gifts to public charities and DAFs are deductible at fair market value up to 60% of a donor’s adjusted gross income (30% for gifts to private foundations).

But less well-known is that timber is also an investible asset. Like real estate, infrastructure and transportation, it’s a
real
asset—that may deliver stable long-term returns, income and inflation protection.
The ancient practice of growing trees goes back, of course, to wood’s value as a construction material. But now returns on timber investment are also coming from a decidedly modern practice: using forests to sequester atmospheric carbon.
Timber investing, as part of a diversified asset allocation, may deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns with extra value because of its sustainability bonus.
The strategic case for timber investment
There’s a strong case to be made for real assets in an inflationary environment. These long-lived physical assets have stable cash flows that often rise as inflation does. Real estate and transportation revenue streams, for example, come from leases that reset periodically.
Timber offers these key opportunities—and more. Forests produce trees that are harvested when mature, yielding logs that are cut in sawmills to produce lumber for construction. Lumber returns correlate strongly with housing demand, growth and ultimately inflation. And timber’s value rises as trees grow.
Forest managers can also decide when, and how much, to harvest depending on prevailing prices. Meanwhile, timber is alive and growing.
Timber’s historically moderate returns and low volatility make a compelling argument for a strategic allocation (Figure 1). It also need not be balanced by fixed income holdings, as other risks assets often are.   As high volatility and recession risk may define the second half of 2022 and prompt portfolio rebalancing, adding the diversification opportunity timber offers may be a healthy move.Positive market outlook for wood demand
Like many other industries, forestry now uses sophisticated technology. Still,  timber managers face uncertainty about future demand for cut wood. Residential construction and renovation drive much of the demand and can be volatile at times during the business cycle. Ideally, there’s a natural ebb and flow between housing demand and wood prices: Rising housing demand is met by more supply—tree harvesting—leading prices to decline. (If demand declines, trees can be left standing, but too many mature trees uncut may depress prices over a longer time horizon, when demand rises.)
A surge in U.S. home construction now, to meet significant pent-up housing demand, suggests a favorable outlook for timber prices over the medium term.
Your potential impact through carbon capture
Trees rise in value as they mature no longer simply because their wood is closer to harvest. Forests also offer a powerful tool in the fight against global warming, appealing to many families and business operations looking to achieve low or net-zero carbon emissions. Growing trees are one of the most effective, scalable ways to sequester (lock away) atmospheric carbon.
In the emerging market for carbon offsets, purchasers—companies and individuals that produce carbon—can buy offsets to their carbon emissions, neutralizing some of it by paying timber growers to not harvest their trees. Such carbon capture can meaningfully reduce total global emissions, while giving the global economy time to adjust to a more sustainable model.
Carbon emissions today, and corporations’ desire to offset them, vastly exceed available carbon offsets for purchase—Russell 3000 companies, for example, produce over 7,000 metric tons of carbon, far exceeding the current supply of offsets: 500 tons.
1
Forestry, at present, represents about 40% of the current supply of carbon offsets. That percentage is likely to grow over time.The new economics of timber investing
For timber investors, there has been a transformation in the ability to generate income from trees while they grow: Rather than waiting to get paid, they can now get paid to wait.
Modern forestry management techniques increase timber’s value. At the same time, carbon offset revenue does not require felling trees to realize returns. Over time, this should keep more trees in the ground, benefitting the environment and also reducing the timber supply overall (all else equal)—thereby supporting  lumber prices.
Forestry companies that can optimize the revenue mix from harvesting trees and selling carbon offsets may generate substantial returns.
Modern forest management seeks to maximize the return potential of timber investingAmid volatile markets, timber’s capacity to potentially deliver steady returns with low volatility can improve portfolio efficiency, while offering resiliency in the face of inflation and rising rates. Looking ahead, we can add the sustainability value of carbon sequestration and the associated income stream from the sale of carbon offsets.
As a metaphor for investment, a tree’s slow and steady growth from a sapling to a tree is obvious. As an actual investment, timber may offer more than just patient growth.
Accessing timber, a renewable resource for generating returns
Investors can gain exposure to timber in several ways: directly owning and harvesting forest land (not common given the highly specialized skills required); owning shares in timber REITs (holding public paper, packaging and wood products companies) that own forests and sawmill and distribution businesses; or through a private fund specializing in forest management and timber harvesting.

August marked a pivot in U.S. equities. While the strong summer rally extended into mid-month, August closed with the S&P 500 losing -4.8%. Hawkish central bank narratives were brought back by Fed Chair Powell’s speech at Jackson Hole. While the eight minute speech didn’t include anything new, the message was clearly against market pricing of a lower policy rate by late 2023. As a result, this week saw markets moving to price out dovish expectations that emerged following the FOMC meetings in June and July. Yields spiked, with the 10-year treasury hitting 3.2%, and the 2-year hitting a 15-year-high of 3.5%. Looking ahead, we think the longer end of the yield curve will likely be anchored, while the shorter end may continue to respond more sensitively to shifting market expectations of the policy path. It is in line with our view that it could be a good time to add duration as a downside protection. We’ve continued to advocate adding downside protection, warning expectations regarding a Fed pivot had run ahead of fundamentals.
Commodities had a volatile week. Crude oil prices fell as production concerns over unrest in Iraq faded, and European natural gas prices declined another ~7% on word of improving gas storage in the region. While stabilizing energy prices are welcome, we’d note that supply is still tight and prices may remain supported over the medium term. In the FX space, the dollar continued to strengthen against its major trading partners. With a hawkish Fed and a cloudy global growth outlook (especially in Europe and China), we think the dollar may stay strong for longer.
Another focus of the week is the agreement on an audit inspection that was reached between Washington and Beijing. It came as a surprise for many, and was welcomed by the market, with the MSCI China rallying 4% on the news, which brings us to today’s strategy question…
Strategy Question: Is the US-China agreement on audit inspection a game changer?
On 26 August, Washington and Beijing reached a preliminary agreement to allow the US Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) to inspect the auditsand personnel of US-listed Chinese firms, as part of a push to avoid the forced delisting of about 200 Chinese stocks from New York exchanges. This round of pilot inspections will reportedly take place in Hong Kong, and if successful, it could mark an important breakthrough after multi-year disputes between the two nations. It could in turn pave the way for a broader deal.
From September this year US officials are expected to travel to Hong Kong to start the process. Pilot inspections are the key test of whether the two sides can resolve issues that have long stymied a deal on audit regulation. These issues revolve around China’s concerns that audit inspections would expose sensitive information on national security or other confidential information to US regulators. If the pilot inspections go ahead, it means that the U.S. and Chinese regulators have in principle resolved key issues.
However, even if the two sides are on track for a deal, we believe Beijing will likely order some companies to preemptively delist rather than be subject to annual inspections. As a sign of what’s likely to come, five large Chinese state-owned firms already announced delisting plans in August. How they treat firms with large amounts of data is the key question – and it will next be important to see whether Beijing orders major tech firms to delist. It’s also important to note this is not a done deal – the full language in the deal has not been made public and the most important aspect will be how it is implemented.There is also a risk that both sides interpret the deal differently leading to implementation problems.
Will this development offset the systematic risk in the Chinese property and banking sectors?
Judging from the initial share price response, the market is taking this news very positively, and triggered a round of short covering. But we caution that it is still unclear how many companies can ultimately avoid ultimate delisting, especially among the tech giants. The inspection process is expected to take months, and there is some chance that the PCAOB may be disappointed about the restricted access to audit papers and personnel.
Although this agreement does not bring any fundamental earnings impact to the Chinese ADRs, it has led to a mild re-rating of China ADRs in the form of multiple expansion, which is a result of lower equity risk premiums. However, in our opinion, this should not be significant enough to make investors forget about the rising structural risk from China’s property and banking system. We have made an extensive discussion on this topic in our recent note published on 19 August 2022 – “
Is China facing a hard landing
?”On a positive note, China’s interim earnings so far managed to mildly beat a low expectation, especially from the Chinese internet names. Earnings risk may be bottoming as companies collectively start focusing on restructuring and cost-cutting, with MSCI China 2022E earnings now revised down to 6% (from 14% in May) based on consensus forecast. But any recovery could be a slower trajectory due to economic weakness from a stagnant property market, rising unemployment and a consumption slowdown. A rare compromise by Beijing, this audit agreement suggests China’s eagerness to boost sentiment in China’s equity market. This is understandable given that a further market correction could lead to a negative spiral effect on China’s already-weak consumption rebound.
MSCI China is now trading at a mid-cycle valuation of 11x 2022E P/E (i.e. a 5-yr average) which we see as fairly valued in light of the challenging macroeconomics and low policy visibility in the second half of the year. News flows from any update on audit inspections – either positive or negative – will likely bring more volatility to the markets, especially to the offshore HK market where the China ADR are dually listed.What would it take for us to turn more positive?
To change our view it would take a larger scale and a more coordinated policy stimulus package with strong commitment from the central government. The scale of the property slowdown is significant, and while a large factor is structural, efforts to deliver unfinished properties and deal with insolvent developers can stem the downward spiral and help to restore overall confidence. Unlike the piecemeal actions we have seen in the last few months, we need developments significant enough to turn around the general public’s weak confidence, which is not easy given the macro challenge and monetary constraints now faced by Beijing. Geopolitical tensions remain a potential black swan that cannot be overlooked. Hence, we continue to advocate trading the range (Hang Seng Index between 19000-22000/ MSCI China between 62-74), and use structured products to monetize current volatility in China equities. We maintain our base-case MSCI China year-end outlook of 69-73.All market and economic data as of September 1, 2022 and sourced from Bloomberg Finance L.P. and FactSet unless otherwise stated.

Markets are pricing a Fed Funds peak of 4% by April, followed by a decline to 3% by year-end 2024. While inflation linked to food/energy, auto parts, other goods and cyclical services are rolling over, less cyclical services and housing inflation are still rising [Ex. 1 and 2; see p.7-8]. And while business surveys suggest that wage pressures have subsided from peak levels, wage growth is still extremely high [Ex. 3 and 4] and payrolls and jobless claims have only weakened a small amount.
If the Fed is committed to restoring positive real interest rates (see chart, right),
I find it hard to justify an increase in equity multiples
.The recent equity rally is often compared to two prior bear market rallies, but both involved deep recessions (1973-1975 and 2007-2009) that we do not anticipate this time.
To be clear, a recession is still a significant risk over the next few months. The US avoided recession four times after prior Fed hiking cycles but each time, food/energy inflation was very low which isn’t the case today [Ex. 5]. Furthermore, new orders have declined sharply relative to production, inventories are high [Ex. 6 and 7], housing is imploding and the US dollar is at a 20-year high (hurting 30%-40% of S&P revenues which are foreign-sourced). If there is a recession, I expect it to be a milder one: private sector savings are higher than before prior recessions, and a macroeconomic projection of the US business cycle points to a less severe contraction than in 2009 or 2020.Bottom line for equity investors:
While consumer price inflation may have seen its peak, it’s still elevated and wage inflation has not rolled over yet [Ex. 4]. The labor force participation rate is still below pre-COVID levels [Ex. 8], but since almost all of the gap is due to the age 54+ cohort, there’s less room for continued improvement (the LFPR for ages 25-54 is now back at pre-COVID levels). Furthermore, a measure of jobs openings plus employment vs the labor force shows the tightest labor markets in decades. So, the Fed will keep tightening. But if there is a recession, we expect it to be a milder one given the health of consumer balance sheets
Leading indicators for the PMI manufacturing survey point to a mild recession next year (see chart above). The declining PMI is also a key input into leading indicators for S&P earnings [Ex.9]. The summer rally was due to rising P/E multiples [Ex. 10] which are unlikely to rise further given positive real interest rates and more quantitative tightening. Given weakening leading indicators and declining earnings, I expect a rollover in US equity markets this fall closer to the June lows for those looking for a better entry point
The last Fed hike for the cycle, when it does occur, has historically been good news for investors; only during the 2000 cycle did the last Fed hike fail to result in a sustained rally [Ex. 11]
See the two charts below: since 2009, financial repression resulted in 20%-60% of the stock market offering dividend yields above Treasury yields, and resulted in short rates that were way below asset yields. Both trends were only sustainable if inflation stayed low forever.
Some of you will miss TINA investing (e.g., “There Is No Alternative” to equities since interest rates are below inflation). I won’t.
It spawned a lot of mindless risk-taking and ruined fixed income markets for a generation, negatively impacting defined benefit plans, insurers and families invested in funds that reduce risk with age.
Good riddance to bad policyWhat it would take for the energy bill’s projected GHG reductions to actually occur, and why it matters
I read a piece in the
Atlantic
entitled “
The Best Evidence Yet That the Climate Bill Will Work
” [August 3, 2022]. The author writes: “First we got the bill. Now we have the numbers”. Really? What you have are projections from three energy modeling teams estimating that the bill could reduce GHG emissions by ~40% by 2030 vs 2005 levels, implying a
quadrupling
in the pace of decarbonization. There’s no discussion in the
Atlantic
article of what would actually have to happen to get there.
I looked at the detailed assumptions made by one of the modeling teams. These analysts are very smart and very well informed on energy transition dynamics.
But: their models often assume perfectly optimal behavior by businesses and individuals based on prevailing incentives, and usually ignore frictional issues such as battery and critical mineral supply chain constraints
3
, interconnection delays of wind/solar power and the difficulty in siting new transmission.
On the latter, House Democrats may block passage of the infrastructure project siting bill that Senate Democrats agreed to in exchange for Manchin’s Inflation Reduction Act support
4
.
The next page compares their assumptions and ours.
The reason this is important
: if you believe the energy bill modelers, the US could start enacting policies to constrain the natural gas industry since the US will need a lot less gas in 2030, and even less after that. But if you believe that the future could be closer to our assumptions,
you would do no such thing
for fear of ending up like Europe: energy-dependent and facing a difficult winter. With gas reserves headed for 90% by November it looks like Germany will be able to make it through the winter without Russian gas, but only if they continue to cut consumption by 15% vs normal levels.Understanding the table.
The table compares our assumptions for the year 2030 with one of the three modeling groups that analyzed the energy bill on behalf of the Senate. The color-coded column highlights the greatest differences between our assumptions and theirs; red = very different, green = very similar.
I emphasized the natural gas share of primary energy since it is a critical policy issue. It affects decisions on pipelines, electricity transmission, energy storage, export policy (European demand for LNG is expected to rise by 2.5x by 2030), winter heating regulations and decommissioning policies affecting coal/nuclear.What will all those new IRS agents be doing?
The Inflation Reduction Act will dedicate $45 billion for tens of thousands of new IRS agents focused on tax enforcement, which the CBO estimates will raise $203 billion in additional revenues over a ten year period for a ~4x return. Sounds easy, doesn’t it? Not so fast; a May 2022 report from the General Accounting Office suggests this could be difficult to do, particularly if the IRS directs new agents to only audit taxpayers with more than $400k in income as requested by Treasury Secretary Yellen and as reiterated by IRS Commissioner Rettig.
The audit rate of individual income tax returns fell from 0.90% in 2010 to 0.25% in 2019. This decline is mostly attributed to reduced IRS funding and attrition of IRS agents. Audit rates decreased the most for those with incomes over $200k, although audits are still skewed towards incomes of $1mm+ (chart, left)
From 2010 to 2019, incremental taxes raised were highest for audits of those earning
less than $200k
(chart, right); the average percent change in the amount owed was highest for this category as well
In contrast, higher incomes had the highest rate of “no change to taxes owed” after audit
Let’s assume that the audit rate for those earning more than $400k reverts back to 2010 levels (i.e., it increases by a factor of 7x). We estimate that this would raise $8-$10 billion per year in 2031 based on data in the GAO report, far short of the $35 billion estimated by the CBO
So, I’m not sure how the Act will raise the assumed revenues if new agents only focus on wealthier taxpayers. In late August, the CBO sent a letter to the House Ways and Means Committee indicating that they had already cut their estimate of revenues raised from $203 billion to $180 billion.Also: is the tax gap as large as advertised?
What may be driving this initiative are estimates of a $300-$600 billion “tax gap” per year according to the Treasury
5
: the difference between what should be paid and what is paid. Most of the gap is due to underreporting of income rather than non-payment or non-filing. However, analysts at the Brookings Tax Policy Center cite several issues that result in tax gap overestimation
6
:
The tax gap cited above includes additional taxes recommended by examiners even if the amount could be reversed on appeal or court challenge. And such reversals can be large:
only 63% of additional taxes recommended from 2015 through 2019 were ultimately assessed
after administrative appeals and abatements. That figure is likely to be even lower after further reductions following judicial review
The IRS uses “detection controlled estimations” in its compliance studies to scale up the recommendations of all examiners to match those with the largest upward adjustments in personal income. In other words, the process is leveraged to revisions made by examiners with the largest estimates of income under-reporting.
This “highest common denominator” approach is estimated to account for two thirds (!!) of the entire individual income tax underreporting gap
The Treasury’s estimate of the tax gap is partially based on a 2007 study citing $1 trillion in US taxpayer offshore wealth and non-payment of taxes on offshore interest and dividends. However: the IRS ramped up offshore enforcement efforts in 2008 after financial institutions in Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Israel and the Caribbean turned over thousands of names to the IRS, resulting in $6 billion in penalties paid. Since then, another $11 billion in penalties were paid by 56,000 taxpayers entering into the IRS Offshore Voluntary Disclosure Program. The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010 made it even harder for US taxpayers to hide assets, and the IRS/Justice Department have consistently prosecuted FBAR violations over last decade, penalizing financial institutions that harbor violators. Bottom line: a lot has changed since 2007
The Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 caused more taxpayers to claim standard rather than itemized deductions, and the C Corporation tax rate declined from 35% to 21%; both are likely to reduce the degree of underreporting of income
Some components of the tax gap reflect taxpayer-IRS disputes regarding the timing of depreciation deductions. While their resolution could increase taxes due in a given year, they do not imply perpetual underreporting of income since taxes due in future years would be lower in these cases
Whatever the tax gap is, new IRS agents are likely to focus on partnerships, sole proprietorships and owners of commercial and residential rental properties
7
. The Treasury believes that income underreporting could be 50%-60% for these entities given less withholding and information reporting (see chart). The Brookings paper also cites underreporting of pass-through income as a factor resulting in tax gap underestimation.
Last point: if you hold a lot of crypto, they may be coming for you as well if you exchange crypto for goods and services without recognizing appreciation as capital gains

Rob Portman (R-OH), a Senator I admire greatly and whose retirement is another sign of institutional decay in the Senate, released a report this year on how China's government targeted Federal Reserve employees in a decade-long infiltration campaign aimed at stealing US monetary policy secrets.
My question
: wouldn’t the Fed’s very poor track record in anticipating future inflation and policy rates dissuade people from wanting to steal its secrets and copy it?

FEMALE VOICE 1:  --podcast has been prepared exclusively for institutional wholesale professional clients and qualified investors only, as defined by local laws and regulations.  Please read other important information which can be found in the link at the end of the podcast episode.
MR. MICHAEL CEMBALEST:  Good afternoon, and welcome to the Labor Day ""Eye on the Market"" podcast.  I haven't recorded something in awhile, so welcome back to everybody who listens to this podcast, and I hope you had a nice end to your summer.
So, there are three sections in the market this month.  A general discussion of what's going on in equity markets, inflation, and the federal reserve, what it would take for the energy bill's projected GHG reductions to actually occur, and why I think that matters so much, and then lastly a look at what all those new IRS agents might be doing, because that was another big part of the inflation reduction act.
To get started, let's talk about what's going on in the markets.  Earlier in the summer I wrote that while there might be a hurricane coming for the U.S. economy, a lot of the damage had already been done in the equity markets, and in May and June we showed all sorts of these charts on how the average NASDAQ stock was down 45%; a third of them were down 70%.  How in prior recessions the equities bottom way before GDP and earnings, and by the time GDP and earnings are rising again, equities have already rallied a lot.  We looked at some measure of investor capitulation that were pretty compelling.
So, I wasn't surprised to see a bounce from the June lows, and particularly since there was a lot of hedge funds that had some short positions they had to cover.  That said, I was a little surprised at the breadth of the rally, because we really don't know where the terminal funds rate is going, and all it took was a tiny little speech from Powell after Jackson Hole to kind of usher in another little mini correction here.
So, here's where things stand right now.  The markets are pricing in a peak fed funds rate of around 3.9% by next April, followed by a decline to 2.9% by the end of 2024.  In other words, funds are at peaks next April and then gradually start declining.  I don't know about that.  Inflation that's linked to food and energy and auto parts and used cards and certain things, they're starting to roll over.
The less-cyclical service and housing inflation numbers are still rising, and some of the business survey suggests that the wage pressures have peaked, but the actual wage growth numbers are still really high and unrelentingly rising.  Then payrolls and jobless claims have only weakened a small amount.  As a result, what you get is the equity markets trading almost lockstep with the tenure treasury less anticipated inflation, in other words, every time you get an increase in anticipated inflation, and in increase in the real rates, equity multiples go down, and then the reverse is true as well.
There's a chart here showing this, and the reason it's so important is those wacky forward earnings multiples of 20 to 22 that we had from the beginning of COVID until a few months ago was taking place because real 10-year yields were negative.  So, as long as you believe that real interest rates are positive now and going to stay positive, I find it hard to justify an increase in PE multiples.
Bottom line is consumer price inflation may have seen its peak but it's still elevated.  Wage inflation hasn't rolled over.  The labor force participation rate has stalled which is adding to tight labor market conditions.  So, I still think there's a one-in-two chance that we have a recession next year.  That said, I think it's a mild one.  Consumer balance sheets are much stronger than they were across the developed world, not just in the U.S., compared to prior recessions.
When we look at a bunch of models on leading indicators for how severe a recession we might have, it doesn't look anything like 2009, and it looks like a milder version of what we had in 2020.  That said, those leading indicators are suggesting a decline in earnings, and so given those weakening leading indicators and what looks like earnings declines, I think we're going to have a rollover in equity markets sometime this fall, closer to the June lows for anybody looking for a better entry point.
We have a whole bunch of charts in here that walk through all of this, but the bottom line is we're coming out of a decade where across the developed world you had financial repression and short rates and long rates, particularly after you adjust for all the quantitative easing that were way below, abnormally below, the returns on financial assets.  That gap is now closing which creates less incentive for leverage, less incentive for risk taking, most incentive for a resetting of portfolios to less-risk assets, and I think that process is going to be something where you don't want to be too aggressive as that's taking place.
So, bottom line is looks like a mild recession for the United States is in the cards.  Earnings will probably decline.  Look for a rollover in the equity markets sometime this fall.  Part of that's already happening.  Then let's just see how far those leading indicators go down.  Of course, the actual wage and consumer price inflation prints over the next few months are going to be really key drivers of just how high rates have to go.
There's a couple of pages of exhibits here.  Some of the exhibits that are worth looking at are exhibits on the collapse of new orders versus production, how inventories are extremely elevated, the leading indicator model that we use to look at what earnings are up to, that kind of thing.
Then there's also a table in here, every time the fed has hiked rates since 1965 you've had a recession sometimes, and not other times.  When you haven't had a recession, the common factor or at least one of the common factors have been food and energy inflation in single digits of 4-5%.  So again, when you haven't had a recession after fed hikes it's happened in those times when food and energy inflation was very low.  That's not the case this time around, and that's why I think you've got a one in two chance for recession next year.
Okay, so let's talk a little bit more about the energy bill and why it's so important to try to understand what's going on with it.  When there's a bill that affects taxes and spending, the CBO comes out with projections of what they think happens to the deficit, growth, inflation, things like that.  There's no government agency to make GHG or climate projections.
When Manchin and Schumer were working on their energy bill they consulted with three outside energy modeling firms to ask them, hey, if we put these policies in place, what are the GHG reductions going to be.  I find in all the breathless support for the bill, and I think it's a good bill, I would have voted for it, but for all the articles talking about a 40-45% decline in GHG emissions resulting from this bill, there's not a single article I've seen to talk about the actual assumptions made to get there.
I took a look at the detailed assumptions by one of those modeling teams.  These people are very smart, they're very well informed on energy transition dynamics, but the models they build assume perfectly optimal behavior by every business and every individual based on economic incentives.
So, in other words, if it makes sense for somebody to buy an electric car economically, everyone will do it.  They ignore the frictional issues related to supply chains for battery and critical minerals.  There's limited acknowledgement of the actual interconnection delays of wind and solar power, and the difficulty in siding new transmission to support that wind and solar power.
Notice that House Democrats, by the way, may already block passage of the infrastructure projects siding bill that Manchin was trying to get them to agree to in exchange for his support.
I looked at a long list of our assumptions versus this modeling group's assumptions, and there were some kind of remarkable differences in there.  They've got a pace of solar and wind additions that would represent the fastest pace of any kind of electricity generation capacity added in history, and by a wide margin.  They have a seven-times increase in the pace of solar installations, 100% EV penetration of sales in 2030 for passenger cars and light trucks.
What's kind of more amazing is a 90% EV share assumed for medium-duty and heavy trucks, even though those don't exist today.  They've got a 30% expansion in the transmission grid over the next few years, even though over the last 10 years it's been closer to 5-10%.  Anyway, we walk through all the assumptions.  Some of the assumptions that we made are similar to theirs.  The reason this is so important is, forget about the GHG issue for a minute, if you accept their presumptions, right now natural gas represents about a third of all primary energy consumption in the United States.  Under their assumptions it drops to 20% in just eight years, and falls rapidly after 2030.
So, if you believe those assumptions you would already be taking steps today to curtail the viability and profitability of the natural gas industry because you don't need it in the future, so you might as well start putting it in wind-down mode, similar to what's being done with coal and parts of nuclear.  Under our assumptions, the primary share for natural gas is only down a couple of percent in 2030, and so you would not take those steps to constrain the growth and viability of the natural gas industry.
So, even more than the GHG emissions, these policy assumptions of how these bills work is really important, because they drive decisions that are going to be made as it relates to a lot of things about which industries are supported and which aren't.  If you take a look at what's going on in Europe right now there's and abject lesson in if you get that wrong it's extremely expensive.  I'm sure you've seen this, but we have chart in here on what's happening with the energy prices in Europe and how Germany could actually run out of gas this winter depending upon what Russia does with supplies.
Anyway, take a look.  I think it's important for all of us to be fluent as possible in the widgets of what drive these GHG assumptions so that we can identify Panglossian articles when they appear on energy.
The last topic for this month's ""Eye on the Market"" is the other component of the Inflation Reduction Act is $45 billion dedicated for tens of thousands of new IRS enforcement agents.  The CBO did score that part of the bill, and they assume a 4:1 return.  In other words, 45 billion invested in new agents and they're going to generated around 200 billion of additional revenues over a 10-year period.  Not so fast.
Audit rates have come down over the last 10 years, but are still highly skewed towards people with incomes of a million or more.  So, let's assume that the audit rate for those earning more than--let's even it out at 400,000.  Let's assume that the audit rate goes back up to seven times what it is now and goes all the way back to what it was in 2010.  Based on some information from the general accounting office on how much additional revenue you raise from those kind of audits, that would raise about $8-10 billion a year in 2031, which is way below the $35-40 billion estimated by the CBO.
This all sounds like boring IRS math until you think about the implications here, because Treasury Secretary Yellen and the IRS Commissioner are saying don't worry, we're only going to direct these new agents to focus on wealthier taxpayers, but if focusing on wealthier taxpayers only raises, let's say, 20-30% of the projected revenues they're going to have to look much more broadly at a broader group of taxpayers to raise the money that was assumed here by the CBO and the House Ways and Means Committee.
We have some data in here on audit rates by income and how much money you make by auditing people and things like that.  I think part of what's driving this initiative is that the Treasury has published a document suggesting hundreds of billions of dollars of a tax gap every year, which is the difference between what should be paid and what is actually paid.  I think a lot of those numbers are vastly overestimated and we walk through some of the computational issues as to why that estimate is way overstated.
But look, that's how we're looking at it.  Other people look at it differently.  The bottom line is whatever the theoretical tax gap is, it looks like these new IRS agents are going to be focusing intently on a broader group of taxpayers involved with partnerships, sole proprietorships, and owners of commercial and residential property.  The clue there is there was a chart from the Treasury that they published this year that showed the percentage of income not reported, in other words, underreporting of income.
For people and entities that are subject to information reporting and withholding, they assume almost a zero percent noncompliance rate, and even when there's no withholding and partial reporting, the noncompliance rate is 15%.  But where they're really going to be looking is they assume a 55% noncompliance rate for certain kinds of partnerships, proprietorships, and owners of commercial and residential rents and royalties and things like that.  So, that really is where it looks like they're going to be focusing here.
We have a couple of pages explaining all of this, and then just to round things out, the IRS also believes that there's a very large degree of noncompliance and nonreporting by crypto holders.  There's been a whole bunch of new executive orders focused on that.
There was a widely publicized on Twitter enforcement announcement of someone you will have heard of for tax evasion related to crypto that took place last week, and so that's what we think is going to come next.  A lot of comprehensive field exams of digital asset funds, principals, and investors, and some economic and other kinds of penalties that are going to be very well publicized to raise the bar for people that are noncompliant.
If you didn't get a chance to see it, in July in the last ""Eye on the Market"" we had a great chart on Bitcoin according to Shakespeare, so if you haven't seen that, please take a look.  It's a chart with different Shakespeare quotes depending on what the price of bitcoin was actually doing.
So, thank you very much for listening.  We are having a Zoom webcast of some kind with Henry Kissinger in September that a lot of you will receive invitations to, to talk about what's going on.  Henry's almost 100, so it'll be interesting to hear what he has to say.  Thank you for listening.  Bye.

Our Top Market Takeaways for September 9, 2022.
Market update
Same as it ever was
Markets returned from the Labor Day holiday and picked up right where they left off. This week though, non-U.S. markets drove most of the narrative.
The European Central Bank raised interest rates by 75 basis points in an effort to get its policy position to a more appropriate stance. With the move, overnight cash rates within the Eurozone were positive for the first time in around 10 years. The primary driver of the inflation problem that the monetary union is dealing with is soaring energy costs. In Germany, contracted power and natural gas prices are nearly 13x higher now than they were in January 2020. The shutdown of the Nord Stream pipeline that supplies Europe with Russian natural gas raises questions about how the European economy will avoid energy rationing over the winter, and how damaging the cost-of-living squeeze will be to households and the economy. We expect growth in the region to be stagnant at best for the rest of the year, especially now that the summer tourism season is behind us.
Meanwhile, in Japan the currency has weakened to its lowest level against the U.S. dollar since
Titanic
and
Saving Private Ryan
were the biggest movies in the world. The Bank of Japan and the People’s Bank of China are the only two major central banks that aren’t raising rates to fight inflation, and currencies are getting hurt for it. For Japan, currency weakness could result in an unwanted form of domestic inflation because imports are so much more expensive, while for China, it is more of a commentary on growth consequences of a rebalancing property sector and continued zero-COVID policies.The irony is that the rest of the world’s problems help to solve the inflation issue in the United States. Due to demand concerns, crude oil prices are at their lowest levels since the beginning of the year. That should help consumption, headline inflation readings and consumer inflation expectations. A strong dollar helps curb inflation from imports and reduces global manufacturing activity. Shipping costs are down almost 65% from their highs, used car prices have peaked, and market expectations for inflation over the next year are below 2.5% for the first time since March 2021. The labor market is showing no signs of strain, despite the headlines around workforce reductions at many technology firms. Initial jobless claims have fallen for four straight weeks and remain at levels entirely consistent with expansion.But that strength in the labor market is the reason why the Federal Reserve will probably raise interest rates by 75 basis points at its meeting in two weeks. The Fed is still not convinced that it has done enough to solve the inflation problem, but the latest data and market indicators suggest that it’s well on its way. We think that after the Fed’s September meeting it will be within striking distance of where it will stop raising interest rates for this cycle. That will mark a critical pivot point for global markets.
Spotlight
The case for core fixed income
If you have been following our commentary, it probably won’t surprise you that investment-grade fixed income is one of our top investment ideas. In fact, we think investors could potentially earn
equity-like returns through a diversified portfolio of fixed income assets
. In today’s note, we want to address the two most common concerns that we hear.
The first is, “I think the Fed is going to continue hiking rates. Why would I buy longer-dated bonds while we are in a hiking cycle?”
The first thing to remember is that interest rates already embed the expectation that the Fed will raise rates to almost 4%. The actual rate hikes therefore won’t be enough to push long-term rates materially higher. Second, we think the Fed is very close to the end of the hiking cycle. Interest rates are already slowing activity in the manufacturing and housing sectors, and inflation markets have already reverted to levels that are consistent with the Fed’s mandate. Finally, the yield curve is deeply inverted. In the last three rate-hiking cycles, inversion of the 2-year–10-year yield curve has preceded the end of the Fed’s tightening cycle by an average of four months. We are two months in this time.The second is, “Why would I want to own corporate and municipal bonds when we are heading into recession and defaults will rise?”
This one is critical because we believe investment-grade corporate and municipal bonds would be some of the best assets to own in the event of a recession. We are focused on the highest-quality pockets of both spaces, where default risk is extremely low. Credit spreads would widen in a recession, but investors should remember that these events tend to be short-lived and that falling risk-free rates tend to offset wider spreads, which helps keep the lid on yields and supports prices. Finally, current entry yields are close to the peaks of the last 10 years, which to us represents a compelling entry point that supports solid forward-looking returns.
Investment takeaways
High-conviction investments in an uncertain economic environment
In today’s global investments backdrop, conviction is a rare commodity. The global economy remains challenged heading into the fall. The housing and manufacturing sectors are slowing substantially, China is still mired in the zero-COVID labyrinth of its own making, and the energy crisis in Europe shows no signs of abating with winter looming.
In times of uncertainty, we focus on what we have confidence in. Right now, we think:
A recession isn’t inevitable, but the risks of one over the next year are elevated.
Central bank tightening is causing volatility across asset classes and reduced capital market activity.
Investing in assets with valuation support and behind secular trends is attractive.
Those three views translate into what we are most focused on from an investment perspective. Adding portfolio buffers such as core fixed income, and focusing on quality and defensive characteristics in equities should benefit while recession risks are elevated. Investors can take advantage of capital scarcity by providing capital to businesses that need it for a premium price, and they can use volatility to tailor more certain return streams or to extract excess yield from markets.
Finally, mid-cap equities are presenting an interesting opportunity based on current valuations, and energy transitions, real assets, digital transformation and healthcare innovation offer exciting long-term investment potential.
While the outlook may be murky, we feel that investors are being presented with many opportunities that may help them reach their financial goals. Please reach out to your J.P.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.A hard landing isn’t reflected in market pricing, the rally is fragile and global inflation is still too high. We expect the Fed to keep fighting.Market Thoughts: Today’s key investor question is, “What’s in the price?”
The operative question for investors right now is: “What’s in the price?” A hard economic landing and deep recession are not priced into current markets.
The Fed isn’t ready to quickly pull back and end policy rate hikes. Abandoning forward policy rate guidance is pragmatic, not dovish. They’re too late in the inflation taming game to be hesitant.
Risk assets have rallied from the recent June bottom. While markets feel ahead of themselves, I hope we’ve seen the low. It remains a fragile market rally.
The challenge for central banks is how much is too much tightening. Markets are giving policymakers, for the moment, the benefit of the doubt.
A relentless obsession.
With a relentless ‘recession obsession’ racing through the headlines, investors are stuck waiting for the next series of economic data to determine if the demand decline we’re seeing is healthy – helping to bring down the trajectory of inflation. The waiting is the hardest part.
The global economy is unwinding excess stimulus. There is a real problem with inflation that central banks need to get in front of (Figure 1). The ‘leader of the pack’ in this call to action is the Federal Reserve (Fed). The risk of a U.S. recession over the next year is effectively a coin toss. Recession is inevitable. Every cycle ends in recession. What matters most is how mild or severe the recession is, how long it lasts and how much damage it does to the economy and markets.Investors expect the Fed to punch above its traditional rate of tightening for a few more policy meetings, then slow down the pace of rate hikes. The European Central Bank (ECB) finds itself in a more precarious position. With war in Ukraine enduring and Russia throttling back its supply of gas to Europe, the ECB has to tread lightly. Both the Fed and ECB are likely to lean into front-loading rate hikes. With the Fed able to be more assertive, the dollar should remain well supported. European growth is under pressure.
There is a bit of emotional anchoring happening currently. Why can’t this be over? Investors wistfully recall how quickly markets sold off as the global economy went into Covid lockdown and then recovered. But markets bounced back because of the force put behind both fiscal and monetary stimulus. Each of those catalysts is being unwound.
As recessionists crescendo, the key question to ask is whether inflation has peaked. We won’t know that for a few months, at the very least. The same with regard to whether central banks can regain equal- if not front-footing in managing inflation. That’s critical. The difference in whether they do or don’t will determine if we get a hard landing. Our current portfolio positioning reflects a base case view that we’re not going to see a hard landing.
What’s in the price?
“What’s in the market price?” is the operative question for investors, in particular as readings for U.S. and European purchasing manager index data show contraction at a composite level (Figure 2). While the bar is higher for slowing growth to weigh on risk assets given the derating in valuations we’ve seen, a hard landing isn’t priced into markets.Equity markets are back to long-term average valuation levels… cheaper, not cheap. If we see earnings markedly move lower, to state the obvious, we’ll give back some of the multiple rerating we’ve seen. That would put pressure again on risk assets. The key is going to be that inflation expectations remain contained and that we don’t see an earnings recession ahead.
We’re seeing a meaningful slowdown in global economic data. Manufacturing and service sector data are signaling a pullback in demand. Like the slowdown we’ve begun to see in the housing market, less demand is ‘good news’ for both the Fed and ECB. Labor market strength is key, allowing central banks to continue to lean into front-loading rate hikes.
If the narrative for consumers is that inflation is too high and expectations are that it’s going to stay that way, the Fed knows it’s losing the battle. They are too late in the inflation taming game to be hesitant. They need to move quickly to contain rising inflation expectations.
I don’t believe the narrative that the Fed is getting ready to pull back and end policy rate hikes. We’re still a long way from the Fed declaring mission accomplished. The Fed abandoning forward policy rate guidance isn’t dovish, it’s pragmatic. It provides optionality for the Fed to take each policy rate decision meeting-by-meeting. The ECB and Bank of England have each done the same. With central banks across developed markets still a long way from pivoting, policymakers need to see labor markets cool. Labor income is going to be as closely watched as inflation.
There is debate on what we’ll see from the Fed at the next few policy meetings. Markets expect the Fed’s policy rate to end this year somewhere between 3.5-4%, its highest level since 2008. The Fed may have to go higher if we don’t see inflation moving lower next year.
How policymakers reconcile slowing growth and declining consumer sentiment against high inflation is key. There has been enough divergence in macro data to please both market bulls and bears over the past few months. There was something for everyone, except clarity that central banks can soon slow their pace of tightening.
Time will tell.
Risk assets have rallied since their mid-June bottom. While markets in general feel ahead of themselves, I hope we’ve seen the low. Markets were well-primed to bounce. That said, it’s been a fragile rally. Time will tell.
This summer felt like we hit peak pessimism. Positioning and sentiment were due for a squeeze higher. A confluence of things provided a contrarian setup for markets to rebound. The fact that supply chains appear to be improving is helping. Also, that we’ve seen oil prices revert back to levels we were at before Russia invaded Ukraine.
In June, we held onto risk positions believing markets were oversold. We took advantage of late summer market strength to reduce our equity overweight, moving underweight European equity markets. Proceeds went into core bonds. We are neutral duration and overweight the U.S. dollar across multi-asset portfolios.
A lot of bad news is priced into European equity markets, so why did we sell? I believe markets aren’t focusing enough on an already weak economic environment that can get worse, as Russia holds back energy exports. Winter is coming and it’s geopolitically empowering for Putin to continue to put economic pressure on Europe.
Europe faces the obvious challenges the war in Ukraine puts on its economy, in particular as it relates to higher-for-longer energy and food prices. It faces a drag on its exports to China, given zero-Covid lockdowns and weaker Chinese consumer demand and growth. And a weak euro is adding to EU inflation. It costs more to import things that are dollar denominated, like commodities.
Natural gas prices have risen dramatically in Europe this year. Russia is the world’s largest exporter of natural gas. They supply about 25% of global gas exports, with 75% of that going to Europe. About 40% of Europe’s gas supply came from Russia prior to the war.
The EU hit their goal of reaching 80% of existing natural gas storage capacity coming into the fall months. That’s the good news. The bad news is that 100% of Europe’s gas storage capacity represents about 25% of annual consumption. It’s going to be a challenging winter.
Best case, I believe European markets tread water and continue to move in line with risk assets. However, the tail risk for Europe is larger than what I expect for the U.S. in the months ahead. We pulled back equity risk given how far and quickly risk assets had risen since June. We’re playing for less upside, with more potential for downside in Europe than the U.S. We’ve right sized our risk positioning accordingly.
Good enough.
Recent U.S. and European earnings announcements were good enough. They were what we expected, surprising modestly to the upside. They haven’t been what hard-landing recessionists feared. However, better than feared earnings positively surprised thanks to energy companies, both in the U.S. as well as Europe. Everything else has been ‘OK.’ And OK earnings – like inflation cooling – are what investors need to see.
I’m using labor market strength and wages as a compass to guide the pace of future rate hikes. We’ve seen this year the fastest year-over-year increase in U.S. unit labor costs since 1982. Recent productivity declines were the weakest two quarter pace we’ve seen in the post-war period. With productivity gains significantly below wage increases, I expect we will hear about companies increasingly guiding down earnings as margins come under pressure.
For the S&P 500, analyst earnings per share estimates have been revised down to about $245 for 2023, from over $250. Our base case expects 2023 earnings to come in right around $240. This year, S&P earnings should be close to $225. To keep it simple, the mental proxy I’m using for ‘fair value’ on multiples is a range of 15-18x, on a forward looking basis.
Taking central banks at their word that they intend to forcefully address inflation, those valuation reference points reflect where S&P multiples have traded historically. I’m a big believer in mean reversion. That said, the pragmatist in me recognizes markets rarely trade for long at historic averages.
A process, not an event.
Policy rate normalization is a process, not an event (Figure 3). There is a reason every major central bank has moved to meeting-by-meeting policy rate guidance. We’ve begun to see what I’ll call the easy rollover in inflation we’d expected a quarter earlier. Russia’s war on Ukraine played a large part in extending inflationary pressure globally. That war continues to run at full-throttle.The challenge for policymakers and investors is how much is too much tightening. Markets are giving policymakers, on the margin, the benefit of the doubt. The Fed in particular has said inflation remains too high and that they need to see “compelling evidence” it’s moderating. Inflation seems to be peaking. We haven’t seen compelling evidence it’s truly rolling over.
The Fed is in play for a 75bps rate hike this month. The ECB just hiked by 75bps. There is still far too much noise in the market and macro outlook. Humility comes in knowing what you can’t know and positioning for what comes next, with a distribution of market risks and outcomes clearly in mind. You learn from life and markets looking back.

Jacob Manoukian, U.S. Head of Investment Strategy
Jordan Sprechman, Practice Lead, U.S. Wealth Advisory
Many investors are starting to add the 2022 U.S. midterm elections to a list of worries that includes a slowing economy, elevated inflation and volatile markets.
Take heart. History has proven that policy eclipses politics. It tends to be the business cycle that drives markets and investment returns over the long run.
That said, we’re focusing on:
The expected outcome of the elections (divided government)
Market implications, given the expected outcome (probably limited)
Issues that have bipartisan consensus and the sectors they affect (there are a few)
Likely fiscal policy response in the event of a recession (probably little with divided government)
Investment implications
Election outlook: Divided government
Prediction markets suggest that Republicans will regain control of the House, while the Senate will be a much closer call.
History clearly signals Democratic losses. Democrats now hold both houses of Congress by very slim margins. In the Post–World War II era, the incumbent party has on average lost 12 seats in the House and one or two in the Senate in the first midterm after a new president’s election. If this trend were to continue, Republicans would take control of both chambers of Congress.
High inflation (even if it is past its peak) has hurt Democrats and perpetuated the perception that today’s Democratic party is worse for the economy. As the slowdown induced by the Federal Reserve (Fed) broadens, these perceptions could become even more negative.
And yet Democrats could still do better than past election cycles suggest. They may gain traction on social issues (notably related to the recent Supreme Court ruling on abortion). And they could benefit from the perceived weakness of Republican candidates in certain key races, especially in the Senate.What the midterms mean for markets
Regardless of the election results, historical data suggests that politics barely affect long-term investment returns. While increased market volatility is likely as November nears, there is no clear relationship between who controls Congress or the presidency and market performance.Sector impact: Defense, supply chains, China
While broader markets will likely shrug off the elections, there are policies and issues up for debate that will be important for certain sectors. The last two years may be a good indicator of what would happen if Democrats can retain Congressional control (by a slim margin): A continuation of a watered-down version of President Biden’s agenda, with a focus on social spending and combating climate change.
But as we expect a divided government, let’s look at some of the issues that have bipartisan support for action, and consider the implications for certain economic sectors.
The fallout of the Russia-Ukraine war has spurred support for increased spending on national defense and securing supply lines deemed critical to national security. Indeed, many on both the right and left see Europe’s energy crisis as a harbinger of what could happen if steps are not taken to reduce dependence on Russia and China for critical supplies. For example, the CHIPS and Science Act, which passed Congress with bipartisan support, provides incentives for the domestic production of critically important semiconductors.
We expect both Democrats and Republicans to back policies that contain growing Chinese influence. It is telling that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s recent trip to Taiwan won rare bipartisan support. This year, President Biden’s budget proposal called for a significant increase in defense spending with the explicit goal of countering China’s increased military outlays.
Meanwhile, the Inflation Reduction Act contains provisions explicitly aimed at reducing U.S. reliance on China for production of clean energy components. Cybersecurity is another sector that could see bipartisan support for action.
Beyond the issues that attract support across the aisle, Biden’s ability to enact changes in the face of a Republican-controlled, or even divided, Congress will likely be limited to what can be done via executive order and regulatory action. Even here, Biden may be limited in what he can do under a conservative-majority Supreme Court. The outcome of legal challenges to Biden’s student loan forgiveness program may be instructive, signaling to what extent Biden can use executive orders under the current Court.
Fiscal policy outlook: Less drag, little new spending
A divided government has implications for major broad-based spending (or lack thereof).
Higher inflation coupled with a likely divided government means that we are unlikely to see major spending packages similar to the legislation enacted in 2020 and 2021 (barring another catastrophe of the magnitude of the pandemic). Gridlock will also likely result in no material changes on the tax front (personal or corporate). While this fiscal spending contraction will help reduce inflation at the margin, most of the fiscal drag is behind us. This drag has resulted in less spending among lower-income individuals, who saw an outsized benefit from COVID-19 stimulus packages.
The optics of a rising debt load mean that the Inflation Reduction Act will likely be the last significant fiscal package for the foreseeable future. The Act itself will have little impact on inflation, debt and the deficit (amounting to net spending of ~0.1% of GDP using a simple average over the next 10 years).
However, recent debt/deficit projections point to a rising debt load regardless. Updated Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projections for the fiscal debt and deficit point to net interest outlays more than doubling from 1.6% of GDP to 3.3% GDP by 2032.
To be clear, we do not believe the rising debt load will have a destabilizing effect on the economy, nor do we think it will affect the U.S. dollar’s status as the world’s pre-eminent reserve currency. If anything, the unprecedented fiscal and monetary response to the pandemic demonstrated that the U.S. government has a lot of room to borrow.
We also note one important technical point: The CBO’s projections assume that interest rates will be higher than their post–global financial crisis range on a sustained basis (e.g., a 10-year rate of 3.8% by 2027). That will have the effect of increasing the government’s debt and net interest expense. Still, the optics of those higher numbers may pressure lawmakers to limit spending.The bottom line: We don’t anticipate any major fiscal policy action until after the 2024 elections. The path of monetary policy will be far more consequential for markets. That’s why we’re keeping our focus on the Fed and the economic data that the Fed follows. The politics, we’ve set aside.
Investment implications
Market volatility will likely pick up as Election Day draws near. Some will be tempted to make politically motivated investment decisions. We continue to stress not letting politics inform investment decisions, especially in today’s highly partisan environment, where political views can significantly impact perceptions of the economy. But under a divided government, far-reaching, market-moving tax and spend policies and regulatory changes will likely be off the table. It may be more useful to focus on the areas impacted by the Inflation Reduction Act and the broader push to shore up national defense and economic security. This includes sectors and themes—such as clean energy, defense and certain industrials—that we have seen as favorable in the post-pandemic era. And remember: Election or no election, volatility is normal and staying invested is the best course of action over time.Contact your J.P.

The Misery Index, which is constructed as the sum of the unemployment and inflation rate, has risen on the back of this year’s high inflation.While volatility is normal around elections, the outcome, regardless of party control, has little impact on market performance. Policy and the business cycle, not politics, drive markets.Shown is how much the Federal government pays in interest on outstanding debt as a percentage of GDP. The CBO, on the back of higher interest rates, expects this expense to increase.

Dan Alter, Mortgage Solutions
As the U.S. real estate market cools, many homeowners are wondering whether they should jump into today’s market quickly—or wait for a rebound. And if they do decide to outlast this downturn, how long might their wait be?
Our analysis finds that a good part of everyone’s answer (at least over the next one to two years) likely lies in where their property is located and, of course, their particular needs and goals.
Unlike the housing bubble that burst in 2006–2007 and depressed housing prices fairly uniformly across the country, we expect the impact of today’s higher interest rates on home values to vary significantly.
Our J.P. Morgan Private Bank 2022 analysis of 116 U.S. metropolitan areas (with a population of >500,000) sees housing prices taking three general paths in the next one to two years as higher mortgage rates and other economic factors increase pressure on the residential housing market:
Overvalued areas
—such as Chattanooga, Boise and Phoenix—may see prices drop 20% to 30%.
Moderately overvalued areas
—including Austin, Tampa and the New York metropolitan area—could potentially see dips of 10% to 15%.
Areas that are not overvalued
—such as Denver, Miami and Washington, DC—are more likely to see prices hold.
If you are thinking about entering this housing market, you may want to ask your J.P. Morgan team to look into your area to help you decide what your best move might be, and when, especially in light of your personal financial goals.
If you are a potential buyer or builder, you might also speak with the team about establishing a line of credit so that you might quickly make offers or paper over construction delays without having to keep excess cash on hand and idle. Competition to purchase homes is still intense in many areas. Supply chain issues and labor shortages are still plaguing home construction.
Housing fundamentals and long-term story are still strong
Despite this potential short-term volatility, the fundamentals of today’s housing market are strong—with sound prospects for the medium and long terms. Even in the short term, we do not expect a dramatic downturn.
Indeed, there is unlikely to be a replay of 2006–2007, when the housing bubble burst. During that period, housing supply far exceeded demand, and the housing sector accounted for an unusually high percentage of U.S. GDP—just under 7%.
Today, housing is a much more reasonable share of GDP, at around 4.5%. Moreover, demand far exceeds supply. According to Freddie Mac, the United States is short 3.8 million housing units that would be needed to keep up with household formation.
1
Another of the many differences between then and now is that the current housing market is shaped by people leaving higher-cost cities such as San Francisco and New York. The COVID-19 pandemic greatly accelerated this migration. The new hybrid and remote work opportunities inspired by the lockdown may continue to reinforce this trend.
These population shifts are major causes of the current and potentially continuing significant disparities in housing valuations across U.S. metropolitan areas.
Our analysis
How can we tell which areas’ housing is overvalued, and by how much?
For a metro area, we looked at the ratio of its median home price to its population’s median income. Then we compared:
How much that ratio increased from pre-pandemic to today
How high that ratio is relative to the area’s history
2
How high that ratio is relative to the current national average
The average of these three “Z-scores” (i.e., the standard deviation from the mean) gave us the final score of how overvalued a metro area’s housing market might be.
It is of course impossible to know for certain how far might prices fall, given these estimated overvaluations. However, history suggests that the housing market goes through a correction when we experience the types of interest rate shocks and valuation excesses we’re seeing today.
In 2022 alone, the Federal Reserve’s four hikes had increased rates by a combined 2.25 percentage points as of early August. As of this writing, the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is around 6.05% versus just 3% at the start of the year. In April, the U.S. housing market started to show signs of softening. Redfin data illustrates that as of July 30, there has been a sharp uptick in the number of listed homes that have had price drops.Of course, in some cases, it may simply be that growth in local industry has yet to catch up. For example, although Austin and Phoenix are probably quite similar, Phoenix shows up as more overvalued. Both metro areas have diverse industries and have been attracting more people. It’s just that in Phoenix, home prices have gotten a bit ahead of what the fundamentals suggest they should be, according to our framework.How might this information affect decisions?
We always tell clients that first and foremost they should consider their needs and goals. Specific market data alone should not drive their decisions.
That said, this information about the housing market can prove useful. For example, this spring, a client received unsolicited offers to sell his Tampa vacation home at a price that was double what he’d paid for the property just one year ago. Given that the Tampa area might see a price correction, he was well advised to consider selling.
In contrast, if you plan to live five years or more in an area that is currently overvalued, you still have ample time to wait out the potential housing market correction.
Clearly your time horizon and the use to which you intend to put the property (primary residence or vacation home) should shape your decisions. In addition, you may want to keep these sound principles in mind:
Pricing adjustments and comparisons
—Buyers should look hard at supposed bargains right now. Markdowns and comparisons to recent sales (in the last six to 12 months) may be no bargain but instead a sign that the initial asking price or local market were inflated.
Local expertise—
Given that pricing a property for sale is tricky in today’s softening market, sellers should be sure to work with a seasoned realtor who knows the local market and luxury space. They also might have to be flexible when negotiating final terms.
Mortgage structure
—When valuations are lowering and interest rates have risen, buyers may want to more carefully consider the size of their down payments (to maintain sufficient equity) and determine whether a fixed-interest or an interest-only mortgage makes more sense. You might also look into tax-aware borrowing strategies that would help lower the effective borrowing rate.
Get all the facts before you make your decision. Speak with your J.P. Morgan team about what is happening in your area. Discuss financing strategies that make sense in the context of your circumstances. And make sure that whatever you decide, it supports your overarching, long-term goals.

Since 1991.Restrictive Federal Reserve policy has resulted in a softening housing market, forcing home sellers to cut listing prices. As shown, this year’s sudden shift from a strong to soft housing market has resulted in more home sellers than typical having to cut listing prices.This representative list segments major metros into the buckets “overvalued,” “moderately overvalued” and “not overvalued” based on our analysis of local housing market valuations. Based on our analysis, housing markets categorized as either “overvalued” or “moderately overvalued” could potentially see price decreases in the near future, while home values in metros in the “not overvalued” bucket will likely hold steady.Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.The world is caught between old school fossil fuels and a clean energy future. Although there is some uncertainty over the speed of the energy transition, it is likely to be a defining theme of the coming decades.In our
mid-year outlook
, the energy transition is one of three key themes of structural change that we believe will drive growth in the coming years. The acute need for energy independence—which requires both traditional and clean energy sources–has been accelerated by the ongoing war in Ukraine.
Looking forward, we expect a simultaneous boom in both traditional and clean energy, as well as associated industrial metals. High prices and continued low levels of investment are likely to support healthy free cash flow and earnings for hydrocarbon-related companies.
But as bright as the medium-term outlook may be, investors should go in with their eyes open. The economic cycle will still impact energy prices, with recession-driven selloffs likely to occur. At the same time – like many disruptive trends – clean energy firms will be subject to swings in sentiment and could be challenged in a rising rate environment.
Yet especially when combined in the same portfolio, long-term investors should consider exposure to both aspects of the energy complex.
Fossil fuel use still dominates the energy landscape
Earlier this year, Michael Cembalest, Chairman of Market and Investment Strategy for J.P. Morgan Asset Management,
released his 12th annual energy paper
. He acknowledges that while the renewable energy transition is “irreversible”, the world still uses fossil fuels for 83% of its energy. Even the most ambitious transition plans will still require hydrocarbon use over the short-term.
There are several reasons why the progress of decarbonization has been sluggish to date. Any serious pathway to net-zero emissions by 2050 must include a combination of increased electrification, energy storage capacity, increased reliance on renewables and decarbonization technologies.
Figures 1 and 2 are frequently used sets of projections for electricity production for both the U.S. and Europe (but the reality is unlikely to follow this script precisely).A reality check for renewables
A major shift to renewables – involving trillions of dollars of investment – is underway, but advocates need to keep their feet on the ground about the ability of renewables to power the world. For example, almost all of the growth would have to come from solar and wind energy. While there are hydroelectric sites that have not been developed yet, most estimates of their potential power amount to just a small proportion of overall electricity demand.
Furthermore, carbon-based energy systems – and nuclear ones – are locationally dense (they can generate lots of electricity from a small area), while renewables are the opposite: They require large areas to generate serious amounts of energy.
All in all, it is clear that we will need more than the massive renewable build-out to reach climate goals.
Challenges facing Europe’s carbon neutrality goals
In the long-term, Europe remains committed to becoming the first carbon-neutral continent by 2050. The war in Ukraine has pushed up hydrocarbon prices and made the transition more urgent. Prior to the war, oil and gas represented more than 50% of Europe’s energy mix, with 20% coming from Russia. Natural gas alone represented 22% of the energy mix and 40% of its imports were from Russia. The threat to (and reduction of) these supplies has led to dramatic increases in commodity prices across Europe’s largest economies.
Today’s energy crisis is a double-edged sword for the climate challenge that the continent faces. On one hand, the cost of renewables is now much more competitive than traditional fossil fuels, incentivizing the transition to net-zero. On the other, supply chain issues and the short-term need for energy is pushing Europe towards other gas suppliers like Qatar and the U.S., thereby replacing one source of fossil fuels with another.
It is also forcing investment into new carbon-intensive energy infrastructure. On balance, in our opinion, the crisis is a net tailwind for the clean energy transition—but this is a transition that will take years to achieve.
The U.S. also faces obstacles
Europe is not alone in having its energy fragilities laid bare. In recent years, the high temperatures in the U.S. have started to strain the electricity grid in several places, leading to a record number of outages and reliability issues. These difficulties show how challenging it will be to build America’s clean energy future.
Much change in policy will be needed to overcome the many obstacles to the transition. The recently passed Inflation Reduction Act is expected to spend almost $400bn on energy incentives to support targets of a 40% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030.
A check on commodities
Despite a sharp selloff in September so far, commodity markets are still considerably stronger than they were at the start of the year. The Bloomberg Commodity Index (BCOM) is up almost +20% year-to-date. In addition to rising demand, most of the commodity complex has been subject to supply constraints that have led to reduced inventory levels. This is very much the case in the energy sector (figure 3).Oil supply looks constrained for a range of reasons. Russian oil is still finding its way to market, although at sharply reduced prices. These discounts will have a longer-term impact for reinvestment, which is likely to constrain Russian supply growth. And despite increasing quotas, OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
)
has failed to attain full production. Although the oil market is likely to remain tight for longer, the futures curve in significant backwardation (with futures trading at lower levels than spot prices) does suggest that prices are set to fall (figure 4).Stress on European gas supplies over support for Ukraine sent European gas prices surging as much as +300% in the last year (though prices have since moderated) and pushed U.S. natural gas up simultaneously.
We believe Europe will continue to seek out alternative supplies, even if hostilities were to cease, and that the U.S. will commit to exporting a larger share of liquified natural gas (LNG) for at least the next decade. This should continue the ongoing trend of rising LNG trade around the world.
The world’s need for energy and constrained supply growth are likely to keep the price of oil and gas high, and our view would be to harvest this yield through select energy bonds and stocks.
Investment opportunities
We believe investors should consider exposure to both traditional energy and related real assets, as well as exposure to the coming investment cycle in clean energy. Given the complexity of the transition, we recommend considering investing through active managers in both public and private markets. Avenues include securities investing in publicly listed equities with exposure to real assets (like the metals and mining, energy, real estate, infrastructure and agribusiness sectors), as well as thematic strategies focused on investing in clean energy transition across the value chain trend.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.There’s a transformation underway in environmental, social and governance (ESG) data.There’s a transformation underway in environmental, social and governance (ESG) data. ESG reporting—and the sustainable investing space as a whole—primarily evolved to serve institutional clients. This produced large, opaque datasets that didn’t cater to individual investor understanding, needs or values.
Individual investors have now joined institutions in demanding accessible ESG reports. As of March 2021, 72% of individual investors in the United States and Europe say they find it challenging to judge current ESG data in a meaningful way.
1
In our view, the lack of “ESG reporting for humans” has been one of the major obstacles between the increasing level of interest in ESG investing and global asset flows.
J.P. Morgan Private Bank will use technology to bridge this gap by bringing personalized and relatable ESG “sustainability reporting” to the market. Rather than one-size-fits-all scores, clients will be able to see a breakdown of certain Causes, such as “tons of carbon avoided” or “number of trees planted” across eligible securities. These figures can help clients review their portfolios to better align them with principles.The traditional ESG data paradigm
There are two ways to report on ESG data: the traditional way relies primarily on inputs, but a newer approach tries to measure some of the outcomes. The first type, “traditional ESG data,” is used to rate companies and create investment products. The raw, underlying data comes from many sources, including corporate disclosures, academic institutions and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).
One problem with traditional ESG data is that it is often inconsistent and opaque. Without a unified taxonomy, scores vary according to each provider’s methodology and definition of sustainability. For example, increasing greenhouse gas emissions can be offset by  adding a female board member. Which should matter more: female board representation or the environmental record? These tradeoffs are inherently subjective, which is how the same company can receive a score of A, or “average,” from one provider and 45.9, or “severe,” from another.
Another difficulty with traditional ESG data is that it was designed for institutions but is less user-friendly for individuals. For most people, it’s not particularly relevant to know that a fund has gone from CCC to BB on its “E” score, or is rated 3 out of 5 “Globes.”
Fortunately, this is starting to change. Growing investor demand, new technology and data transparency are paving the way for user-friendly ESG reporting.Sustainability reporting is personalized, relatable and dynamic
The second emergent category of ESG data is referred to as sustainability reporting. This reporting typically happens
post
-portfolio construction. It utilizes much of the same underlying data sources as traditional ESG reporting, but then re-calculates them at the
investor portfolio
level according to the things individual investors care about expressed in more nuanced terms (e.g. dollars invested in women leaders or tons of carbon removed from the atmosphere).
These measurements must be grounded in concrete data and help make sense of some of the inherent and subjective trade-offs behind the numbers. However, providing information to individual investors about their holdings—by measuring their investments against specific causes that are important to them—can help bring a personal connection to their portfolio. In the future, this information can be more immediately accessible to help guide their investment decisions.
OpenInvest is integrating our technologies with J.P. Morgan to enable sustainability reporting for J.P. Morgan investment accounts and other eligible assets.
2
For example, if you’re concerned about climate change, your J.P. Morgan team would work with you to assess where your portfolio stands on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, fossil fuels and deforestation. This will make it easier to review your portfolio against certain principles.Exciting metrics, easy dashboards and “diagnosing” held away assets are just the beginning. The future of sustainability reporting lies in personalized feedback loops. Perhaps a new woman is elected to a board of a company, a new data set emerges on gender pay gaps in Europe, or you watch a documentary on American mass incarceration and want to incorporate this into your investment strategy. Together with J.P. Morgan, we aim to develop reporting and technology that will provide personalized feedback loops, allowing investors to review their holdings with a focus on their values, adjust in order to better align their investments with their principles and facilitate seamless values-based investment decisions.
In summary, sustainability reporting is distinct from ESG data in three key ways:
Reflects your
whole portfolio
, not just individual holdings
Relatable metrics
, such as “number of veterans hired""
3
Updates dynamically
based on your investment decisions
Insights for investorsSustainable investing is not a binary measure—there are personal considerations that can never be reconciled with a standardized dataset. All the underlying research and quality data are essential. But at the end of the day, only you can be the arbiter of choosing the most important environmental, social and governance factors that match
your beliefs
.
Having access to user-friendly sustainability reporting can help you understand your investments in a holistic, meaningful way, empowering you with the data you can use to evaluate your financial decisions. This shifts your relationship to your portfolio from just risk and return to a dynamic and engaging reflection of your identity and values.
OpenInvest led the industry in developing sustainability reporting. We’ve seen firsthand that this feature helps encourage individuals to invest with their values. This is
critical
. Along with every other human industry, the financial system must rapidly transition to environmental and social sustainability. With the scale of our forthcoming implementations, we are confident that “sustainability reporting for humans” will not only inspire millions of J.P. Morgan clients, but will help unlock the client demand necessary to tip the full industry toward a sustainable future.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Arrested Development: the tightest labor markets in decades are pressuring the Fed; can “second chance” policies for those with criminal histories expand the labor force?  Also: the Citrix canary and a COVID update
As I wrote in our Labor Day piece, we expected the S&P 500 to re-test June lows and now we’re there.  Equity markets have been slow to digest the path of future policy rates shown in the first chart below.  Additional headwinds come from Europe’s energy mess, and from China’s real estate collapse (bad debt ratio of 30% and rising) and its zero COVID tolerance policy.  More broadly, as shown in the second chart,
we’re emerging from a decade of abnormal pricing for risky assets relative to cash, which argues for lower valuations on just about everything
as the gap closes and normalizes
.  As we wrote on Labor Day and earlier in the year, we do not envision a deep US recession based on the strength of consumer balance sheets, but we think better entry points on equities still lay ahead.
Consider the Citrix deal whose senior notes priced at 10% vs initial underwriting levels of 6.5%; underwriters still reportedly hold the all of the second lien Citrix notes which would require much larger discounts to place with investors.  Pending large buyout financing deals include Twitter, Nielsen, Tegna and Tenneco, all of which are lower rated by Moody’s than Citrix.  Citrix may be a canary in the coal mine given the limited selloff so far in high yield spreads and leveraged loan prices, which at 6% and $93 are still below recessionary levels.Early warning signs on earnings appear below. Consider US consumer staples: while Q2 revenues rose, all of the increase resulted from price hikes while unit volumes were down. As the economy weakens with rising Fed Funds rates, it will become harder to pass through rising costs. Other early warning signs on earnings include leading indicators with which they’re correlated (see chart below), and that’s before taking into account a projected ~2% EPS decline from the new 15% minimum book tax mostly affecting tech and healthcare companies, and the 1% buyback tax. Last point: as Gavekal Research highlighted in a recent note, the ratio of S&P to NIPA (economy-wide) profits has risen to 1.2x again, a level which historically has been a reliable indicator of pending profits recession.
To be clear, institutional positioning and individual investor sentiment are quite bearish and some valuations already price in bad news
: China banks at less than 0.5x book value, Europe 10.7x forward P/E converging on 2012 debt crisis lows and Metaverse-Fintech-Hydrogen-SPAC stocks down 50%-80% from their peaks.
But all eyes are on the Fed and its vanishing hopes of a soft landing, which we discuss next (after a brief COVID update)
.A brief COVID update: bivalent vaccines, inhalable vaccines and preventable deaths
While vaccine protection against infection and transmission have dropped sharply with efficacy below 50%, studies focused on people aged 60+ still show large declines in mortality and hospitalization risk from a 4
th
shot compared to two or three shots
Unvaccinated people (most of whom have already been infected) have 14x the risk of dying than vaccinated people, suggesting that infection-induced immunity is much weaker than immunity from vaccines
New bivalent mRNA vaccines are now available and have been engineered to work against the original strain and against Omicron BA4/5.  There is not a lot of efficacy data yet; the decision to move forward was based on the results of a BA1 vaccine, a Beta variant vaccine and lab data from mice
A new report from the NEJM indicates that mucosal (nasal) antibodies are what may be needed to more effectively block infection and transmission, since that is where airborne pathogens are first introduced into the body
China approved its first inhalable COVID vaccine manufactured by CanSino, which uses the same adenovirus vector approach that it uses in its injectable vaccine.  Early trials showed better immune responses than a regimen of three shots, and CanSino claims that its inhalable vaccine also needs much less viral material to be effective.  India’s Bharat Biotech has also approved its own inhalable adenovirus vaccine which it developed in conjunction with researchers at the Washington University (St Louis) School of Medicine
Inhaled vaccines are best used in tandem within injected vaccines rather than replacing them, since injected vaccines produce antibodies in the bloodstream and internal organs which are needed if nasal defenses fail
As per Brown’s School of Public Health and Microsoft AI: from January 2021 to April 2022, the US experienced 320,000 deaths that could have been prevented if such individuals had been vaccinated.  Excess death rates are still 10% above expected levels, and in 2021, the US experienced the largest decline in life expectancy in 100 yearsWhy would the Fed tighten into a weakening global economy? The risk of wage-price spirals apparently worries them even more. Can the US labor supply increase without a deep recession?
The Fed is under the gun: the monthly job fill rate as a % of openings has collapsed, and the ratio of employment plus job openings to the size of the labor force is close to its highest level on record. Other similar indicators:
People switching jobs are earning a very high premium relative to those who stay put
A Brookings paper cites labor market tightness as being responsible for 80% of the increase in consumer price inflation since 2020
1
[note: in our view, explosive monetary and fiscal stimulus, supply chain delays due to COVID and energy policy were the primary drivers of the initial rise in inflation]
A new NBER paper estimates NAIRU (the non-inflationary rate of unemployment) at 6%, one of the highest rates since the 1980’s
2
2.5% of the US workforce is estimated to have been lost to excess retirement during COVID, a variety of other COVID related issues (long COVID, terminations, child care shortages) and the decline in immigration
3
It’s hard to increase the labor supply. Birth rates are stagnant, immigration is just beginning to pick up (see Appendix) and it’s difficult to lure retired people back into the workforce. Unless the labor supply increases, wage-price spirals could become more commonplace; this is a risk that the Fed is clearly focused on. As we discussed last time, labor force participation is already back to normal for 25-54 year olds; it remains depressed for those over 54.
One potential pool of underutilized labor
: the population of people with a criminal arrest record, many of whom were never convicted for serious crimes and/or incarcerated. Let’s take a closer look.Could “Second Chance” legislation help reduce the US labor supply shortage? It’s worth a closer look
Second chance legislation refers to policies designed to ease the path to employment for people with a criminal record, some of whom have been incarcerated although many people with an arrest or conviction record haven’t been.  Given the recent increase in violent crime rates, it might seem like an odd time for this; but if such policies can reduce recidivism, a wide range of social, economic and workforce issues could improve.
Main components of second chance legislation
:
“Clean Slate” procedures under which criminal records are automatically expunged if individuals remain arrest-free for a specified period. Eight states have passed such legislation: PA, UT, MI, CT, DE, OK, CO, VA
“Ban the Box” legislation which would require most private employers to postpone asking about an applicant’s criminal record until after the applicant has had an opportunity to interview, or until after a conditional offer of employment has been made. More than 100 cities/counties and 19 states have already enacted ban the box policies, as has the Federal government
4
The FDIC has recently narrowed the circumstances under which written consent is required in order for a bank to hire individuals with minor criminal offenses, but more can be done by Congress
Prevent unpaid court debts (fines, fees, costs and restitution) from being a barrier to record clearing. In almost every jurisdiction, outstanding court debt is a barrier to record clearing, either rendering a person ineligible for record relief or making it difficult for them to qualify for it
5
Standardize record clearing timetables across states. These timetables refer to the time during which individuals must be crime-free in order to qualify for record clearing. Dispersion across states is very wide; for example, some states allow clearing of felony convictions after 1-3 years, others after 5, 7 or 10 years, and 16 states do not allow felony record clearing at all
6
To understand why this legislation is worth thinking about, consider the following:
One third of the adult working age population has a “criminal record”
that can impair their ability to get a job, even though most have not committed a “serious crime”, and even after the rest fulfill their justice system obligations.  Criminal records are retained by the Department of Justice in its Interstate Identification Index even though many people who get arrested are never charged or convicted
7
. Around one third of employers consider an arrest without conviction as ""somewhat influential” in their hiring decisions
In another study,
64% of all unemployed males between the ages of 30 and 38 had been arrested at least once
, with negative implications for marriage, education, net worth, employment and earnings
8
With respect to drug arrests, 70%-80% have been for possession rather than manufacture (see Appendix)
The current system of having records expunged is costly, complex and very time-consuming; as a result, few people pursue it even though having an arrest record reduces the chances of being contacted by an employer by 50%-65%
9
. Example: among those eligible for expungement in Michigan, just 6.5% obtain it within five years of eligibility due to a limited understanding of expungement laws and procedures, application fees and possible loss of wages for time taken off work
10
The US has the highest rate of incarceration in the world, just above Rwanda, Turkmenistan and El Salvador. Formerly incarcerated people are routinely and systematically shut out of the work force
In one study
11
, 33% of parolees found no employment over four years post-release, and at any given time no more than 40% was employed (i.e., a roughly 60% consistent unemployment rate). Those who were employed had an average of 3.4 jobs throughout the four-year study and earned 50%-80% of median wages, suggesting they were landing jobs that didn’t offer security or mobility
Someone imprisoned as a young adult suffers a lifetime earnings loss of $480k, regardless of the offense
12
All of the above contribute to the US having one of the lowest male labor force participation rates in the OECD (see Appendix)
Will such second chance programs “work”? In other words, when Ban the Box and record clearing legislation exists, do such policies sustainably increase the work force?
They just might. Studies differ, of course; here are some noteworthy analyses.
Employment has been estimated to be the most significant factor in decreasing recidivism
13
In Chicago, formerly incarcerated people who had found employment for one year had a recidivism rate of only 16% over three years compared to a 52% for all other releases
14
However, it appears that “any job of any kind” doesn’t help as much. In several studies, recidivism rates only declined when parolees got higher paying jobs leading to sustainable career pathways
15
, such as construction and manufacturing jobs rather than retail or food service jobs
16
Reducing employer liability could increase hiring rates of people with criminal records. According to the Society of Human Resource Management, 52% of employers said their primary reason for checking candidate backgrounds was to reduce legal liability rather than to ensure a safe work environment (49%) or assess trustworthiness (17%)
17
In a criminal background check, how far back should employers look? In other words, how long does it take for someone who has been convicted or arrested to demonstrate that it won’t happen again? By shrinking the time horizon of background checks, pathways to employment increase
One answer comes from a 2009 paper which looked at 88,000 first-time arrestees in New York and followed them for the next 25 years to see whether if they committed other crimes. After a sufficient amount of time following a prior offense passes without new charges, ex-offenders are no more likely to be arrested than the average citizen. For those who commit their first crime at a young age or whose first crime is a serious offense, it takes about eight years without another offense. For others, such as those who commit non-serious crimes, it can take as little as three years
18
Policy experts in this field believe that viable employees are being passed over unnecessarily
.  Emerging research suggests that some combination of age, number of prior convictions and time since last conviction (and
not
the nature of the crime itself) are the best indicators of future criminal activity risk.  In other words, the older someone is and the more time that elapsed since the crime occurred, the lower the risk to the employer of recurrence.  Algorithms have their problems and biases, but policies driven by empirical data are probably better than the ad-hoc and zero-risk tolerance approaches used today by many hiring managers.
Employers are increasingly turning to second chance hiring
The Second Chance Business Coalition, co-chaired by JPMorgan Chase, represents more than 40 large companies across industries that are committed to developing best practices and tools for employers to deploy second hiring and advancement strategies at companies like Accenture, CVS, Eaton, General Motors, McDonald’s, Microsoft, Verizon and Walmart
Last year, JPMorgan Chase hired more than 4,300 people with criminal backgrounds (~10% of new hires in the US) whose history fit within industry regulatory guidelines and had no bearing on the requirements of the job they were seeking
Many were involved in low-level crimes such as disorderly conduct, personal drug possession and DUI (driving under the influence), and are employed in jobs such as transaction processing, and lending and account servicing
The firm “banned the box” that asked about a candidate’s criminal or arrest records on initial job applications, and established a community hiring strategy that provides legal services, job search support and mentorship in collaboration with local nonprofit organizations
In addition to our own hiring practices, the firm is supporting Second Chance legislation at the state and Federal levels through the JP Morgan Chase Policy Center
Second Chance Bills in front of Congress
Fair Hiring in Banking Act, H.R. 5911,
would expand employment opportunities for those with a previous minor criminal offense without posing safety and soundness risks to the financial system. This measure passed the U.S. House of Representatives in May with significant bipartisan support and is expected to be introduced in the U.S. Senate this month.
Clean Slate Act, H.R. 2864
, would create a process for clearing low-level nonviolent federal records and streamlining the process through automation.
Fresh Start Act, H.R. 5651
, would allow states that have expungement or sealing laws in place to apply for a Federal grant to help automate the process.

MR. MICHAEL CEMBALEST:  Good morning, this is late September Eye on the Market.  This one’s called Arrested Development for reasons we will discuss.  There are three topics I want to go through this time.  One is on markets and the Citrix canary.  The second topic is labor markets, the Fed, and if second chance policies for those people with criminal histories can expand the labor force.  And then lastly, a brief COVID update.
So, on markets and Citrix and high yield and everything, I wrote in our Labor Day piece that we had expected the S&P to retest the June lows; now we’re there.  Equity markets have been very slow to digest the path of policy rates, which continue to rise.  It’s almost like people didn’t take Powell at his word, and Powell was extremely slow to recognize what was unfolding in front of him.  Amazing that the Fed barely had forecast any rate increases a year ago, even though we had very tight labor markets and commodity prices were skyrocketing.
So you have the additional headwinds from Europe’s energy mess, China’s real estate collapse, its zero-COVID policy, et cetera.  So more broadly, as we show in here, we’re emerging from this weird decade where the pricing on risky assets was very high relative to the pricing of cash and cash equivalents.  And now that that gap is closing and renormalizing, that argues for lower valuations on a lot of different things.  So we don’t think there’s a deep US recession coming, particularly given the strength of consumer balance sheets.  But we think that better entry points on equities probably still lay head sometime between now and next spring, when the fund rate peaks.
Now on the Citrix deal, which a lot of you probably read about, the senior notes were originally underwritten a few months ago at 6.5.  They got placed at 10, and the underwriters still reportedly held all of the second-lien Citrix notes, which had initial underwriting levels of 8.5, and nobody really knows where those would’ve been placed because they weren’t placed.  And Citrix was reportedly one of the better deals in the pipeline.  What comes next is Twitter and Nielsen, Tegna, Tenneco, all of which are lower rated and/or more cyclical than Citrix.  So given while there’s been a lot of repricing in the equity market so far, the selloff in high yield and leveraged loan has been pretty modest.  And Citrix, this Citrix deal and the next couple may be telling us something more about how much assets will reprice here.
We’ve got some charts in here on leading indicators for earnings, which are falling.  They’re not dropping off a cliff, but obviously they’re declining as the economy gets weaker.  And there is some evidence that positioning and sentiment are very bearish, and some valuations already price in a lot of bad news.  And China banks are trading at less than half of book value.  The P/E ratio on European equities is getting pretty close to the 2012 debt crisis lows and then all that kind of Metaverse, Fintech, hydrogen, SPAC nonsense stuff is down 50 to 80% from its peak.  But right now, all eyes are on the Fed and a rapidly vanishing window for a soft landing.  And that’s what we’re going to discuss next, as it relates to the Fed and the labor markets.
So a lot of clients are asking why in the world, with the Fed tightened into a weakening global economy.  That’s a good question.  But the risk of wage price spirals apparently worries them even more.  The Fed’s under the gun here.  The monthly job-fill rate has collapsed, right.  That’s the percentage of open jobs that get filled each month.  There’s a measure you can look at that looks at the ratio of employment plus job openings to the size of the labor force.  So there’s a lot more jobs than there are workers right now.  And that that number is close to the highest level we’ve seen in decades.  People that switch jobs are earning a big premium relative to those who stay put.  And then there’s a whole bunch of academic research coming out, citing labor markets as being responsible for the bulk of the increase in CPI.  The latest NARO [phonetic] estimate from one of the other papers is 6%, which is one of the highest estimates we’ve seen in a long time.
And so it’s hard to increase the labor supply.  Birth rates are stagnant, immigration is just beginning to pick up, and it’s difficult to lower all those retired people back into the workforce.  I think two-and-a-half times the number of people retired over the last couple of years compared to prior pre-COVID trends.  And so unless the labor supply picks up, the wage price spirals could become a risk for the Fed.  And that’s why they may see themselves as being forced to crush the economy to get that labor supply number and labor inflation back to normal.  And as we discussed last time, the labor force participation rate is already back to normal for 25 to 54-year-olds.  It’s very depressed for those over 54.
So there’s a section in this piece, and I’m not going to go into too much detail ‘cause you kind of have to read it to see what we’re getting at, but there is a potential pool of underutilized labor in the form of people with criminal arrest records, a lot of whom are never convicted for serious crimes or incarcerated.  And this is something that J.P. Morgan has done a lot of work on as a firm and with other members of the Business Coalition.
And in general, clean slate procedures refer to things that ease the paths to employment.  It can be things like having your arrest records automatically expunged if you remain arrest-free for a certain period, something called ban the box approaches, which would require private employers to not ask about criminal records until after they’ve had the chance to interview or after they’ve been made a conditional offer of employment.  The FDIC can do more to allow our banks to hire individuals with minor criminal offenses until recently that required written waivers.
I think more can be done in terms of preventing unpaid court debts from being able to clear your arrest record.  In almost every jurisdiction, any outstanding fines and fees and things like that can be a barrier to having your record clear.  And then in some states, they don’t allow for clearing of felony convictions at all, despite the number of years that you might be crime-free.
And to think about why this is important, and when I started looking at this, I didn’t think this was going to be this important and I found these numbers kind of shocking, one-third of all working-age adults in the US have a criminal record, which is again kind of shocking to me.  And obviously that’s going to impair their ability to get a job, even though most of these people have not committed what you and I would consider to be a serious crime, and even after the rest of them who did commit serious crimes fulfill their justice system obligations.
And another study, and I spoke to someone from the Rand Institute who worked on this, almost two-thirds of all unemployed males who are currently unemployed today between the ages of 30 and 38 had been arrested at least once.  And so again, it points to the fact that there could be, amongst this population of people that had been arrested, barriers to employment that are worth thinking about.  And with respect to drug arrests, 70 to 80% of them historically have been for possession rather than manufacturing.
And then as you all probably know, the US has a higher, the highest rate of incarceration in the world, above places like Rwanda and Turkmenistan.  So there’s a large pool of people here who could potentially benefit.  And the US also has one of the lowest male labor force participation rates in the entire OECD.  And again, that’s another sign that we’ve got people missing from the workforce, and some of these second chance policies have the potential to really help on this front.
The last topic for this week’s piece is a brief COVID update.  I haven’t talked to you or written to you about COVID in a little while, and I wanted to just give an update on the bivalent vaccines, the inhalable vaccines, and preventable deaths. So as we all know, based on how transmissible omicron is, the vaccines are no longer very effective in terms of preventing infection and transmission.  Those efficacy rates have dropped below 50%, and that’s in particular, after four to six months.
However, studies focused on people aged 50 and 60 and above, a cohort that I care a lot about, still show very large declines in mortality and hospitalization risk from a fourth shot compared to either two or three shots.  So there’s a lot of research here showing the benefits in terms of mortality and hospitalization risk, even if it’s hard to prevent infection transmission.
The other thing that’s interesting is that a lot of the studies showing the risk of unvaccinated people versus vaccinated people ending up in the hospital or dying, is that a lot of the unvaccinated people have already been infected.  So to the extent that those rates for unvaccinated people look bad, it now tells us that infection-induced immunity is not nearly as strong as immunity that’s acquired from vaccines.
So there are these new bivalent mRNA vaccines available.  Bivalent simply means they’ve been engineered to work against two different strains, the original strain and omicron BA 4 and 5.  There’s not a lot of hard data on efficacy yet for these new vaccines.  The decision to move forward with them was based on the results of some prior vaccines and some lab data on this new vaccine from mice.  So efficacy data should be rolling out in the weeks ahead.
But looking forward, what the world really needs, and we’ve all obviously been reading about this a lot, is something that does a better job on infection and transmission.  And there is a new report from the New England Journal of Medicine indicating that that nasal mucosal antibodies are what may be needed to really block infection and transmission, ‘cause that’s where pathogens, airborne pathogens, are first introduced into the body.
A bunch of companies are working on this.  Take for what it’s worth, China improved its first inhalable COVID vaccine, and I can understand why people would have concerns about the data there.  But according to what they’ve reported, their trial show a better immune response from two injectable vaccines plus an inhalable booster, than from a regimen of three shots.  They also claim the inhalable vaccine needs a lot less viral material to be affected.
And what I think is interesting and important is that India’s biotech approved its own inhalable vaccine, which it developed in very close conjunction with researchers at the Washington University of St Louis.  So that has an imprimatur that I feel much better about.  And I think in the future, the inhaled vaccines are going to be used in tandem with the injected ones.  You still need the injected vaccines to produce antibodies in your bloodstream and internal organs in case the nasal vaccine defenses fail.
So that’s a brief COVID update.  Thank you very much for listening.  I’m very proud of Jamie’s testimony last week, particularly as it relates to energy topics.  And for those of you that read the Eye on the Market annual energy paper, you will understand why.  Thank you for listening, and I’ll talk to you next time, bye.

Nur:
My name is Nur Cristiani, and I’m the Head of Latin America Investment Strategy at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. Today we invite you to join and discuss how investors can anticipate opportunities in the Agriculture-food-technology sector in Latin America. I’m joined today by Pratima Singh from the Economist Impact team.
Pratima
:
Thanks Nur, and it’s great to be here discussing this topic with you. I’m Pratima Singh and I’m a Principal with Economist Impact’s Policy and Insights team in New York, and I focus on issues around sustainability, the circular economy and natural resource management with a particular focus on the agriculture and food sector.
Nur
: Thank you for joining us, Pratima. We have been working with Economist Impact for a couple of years now to produce long shelf-life and timely pieces on trends brewing in Latin America that could present interesting opportunities for our clients, both for their businesses and their portfolios. This time, we’re here to talk about the agricultural sector. We all know LatAm’s huge potential in this space, but what is needed to take us to that next level? As much as everywhere, “tech” is permeating into the sector, opening up new grounds for development. So Pratima, let’s talk about these new “AgTech” ventures in the region, what of the long-standing challenges are they addressing and what type of innovations can we look forward to.
Pratima
:
This quarter, we delve into the growing challenges the Latin America agricultural sector is facing, and analyse how agriculture and food (agrifood) technology innovations can help mitigate those challenges and position Latin America as a global breadbasket in the years ahead.
Our article, titled
“Small-scale solutions in a large-scale transformation: Unearthing untapped opportunities in the agrifood sector in Latin America”
invites investors to explore the shifting trends in the agrifood sector.
We believe that investors who are able to understand agrifood technology developments in the context of Latin American large, mid- and small-holder farms can stay ahead of the curve and strategically invest to leverage the region’s increasingly important role in supplying global agricultural demand.
I invite our audience to read the article at the JP Morgan Private Bank website.
Nur:
In your view, what are the key insights from the article?
Pratima
: In researching AgriFoodTech in the context of Latin America, our research highlighted four key upcoming trends:
Firstly, the growing global demand for agricultural products will position Latin America to become a global breadbasket, but the region will need to boost the productivity and sustainability of its agricultural practices to meet this demand.
Secondly, smallholder farms play an important role in Latin America’s agricultural development, and understanding the unique nature of the region’s agricultural supply market is key to making smart investments.
Thirdly, Agrifood technology projects and companies in the region at the pre-farm, on- farm and post-farm stages highlight the increasing innovation happening in the region.
And finally, we found that a major investment opportunity is being overlooked in Latin America. The region ranks last in agrifood technology investments with just $440m being invested in 152 deals over the last 5 years, which is a fraction of the $135.28 billion in global Agrifood technology financings.
Nur:
Thank you for that summary, and I would love to dig into some of these themes a bit further. You mentioned that global demand for agricultural products is creating a unique position for Latin America.
Can you explain what global trends are having the greatest impact on agricultural markets, and how will they shape the demand for food products around the world?
Pratima:
The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) predicts increased tightening of food markets in the year ahead, due to soaring input prices, weather concerns and increased market uncertainties stemming from the war in Ukraine.
In the longer term, global food demand is expected to increase anywhere between 59% to 98% by 2050,
representing an astounding increase in food demand over the next three decades
Nur
:
And what role will Latin America play in helping to meet this demand?
Pratima: Latin American countries provide crucial agricultural goods to the global market,
and the region is a global breadbasket.
To highlight global agricultural contributions on a country-by country basis; agricultural export data reveals that Brazil is the world’s third largest agricultural exporter (after the United States and the European Union), and produces most of the world’s sugar, coffee and orange juice, and is the largest exporter of beef, soybeans and poultry. Argentina is the largest exporter of soybean meal and soybean oil in the world, and third in bean exports. And Mexico is the third largest agricultural exporter in the region producing vegetables, fruits and other agricultural byproducts.
The Latin American region overall currently accounts for 16% of total global food and agriculture exports and
has the highest share of net agricultural exports in the world.
The region is also one of the few parts of the world with
significant unexploited agricultural land.
Latin America has more than 5 million square kilometres of arable land, 23 percent of the world’s forest areas, and between 60 and 70 percent of all life forms on Earth. It receives 29 percent of the world’s rainfall and contains about 30 percent of the world’s renewable water resources.
Because of this natural resource advantage, the Latin American region is likely to continue to play a pivotal role in global food production and exports in the future.
However, the aggregate output of agricultural goods in Latin America is predicted to drop in the upcoming year. Latin America is particularly vulnerable to climate change and variable weather, and the el Niño phenomenon further exacerbates these conditions by creating water shortages and raising temperatures, straining crop production and agricultural capacities. Because of these conditions, there are likely to be poor producer margins in the year ahead. This
emphasises the need for sustainable agricultural development, and new innovations to promote sustainable development.
Nur
: With such power at hand, why has LatAm not been able to capitalise on it in order to improve the productivity of the land and thus the level of livelihood of the people living off of it? What kind of transformations are required to enable Latin American farms to meet these new agricultural demands?
Pratima
: To help the region match global agricultural needs requires
four major transformations,
according to the International Fund for Agricultural Development:
The first is an
increase in investment in agriculture and rural development
across all aspects of the production cycle, including infrastructure, technical assistance and rural financial services.
There needs to be a
strengthening of capacities
in each country, including the development of policy frameworks aimed at promoting effective government institutions and reducing poverty.
Thirdly,
agricultural research needs to be further promoted to better develop and share new and improved technologies
And finally, there is a
need for more private sector involvement in agricultural services
, including in finance and marketing and the development of public-private partnerships.
However, we need to consider the unique nature of Latin American agriculture to understand these necessary transformations in context. Large farms account for much of the commercial agriculture that generates Brazilian and Argentinian exports, but
it is estimated that more than 50% of the Latin American region´s food production comes from its 14 million smallholder farmers.
That means there is a huge amount of variation in terms of the scale and sophistication of agriculture and in terms of its contribution to the economy to consider when assessing the agrifood tech market.
Understanding the path forward for increasing agricultural output will rely on understanding the dynamics among farm types in the region.
Small family farms account for nearly 40 percent of agricultural outputs in Brazil and Mexico, and more than 60 percent in Central America
. The role of smallholder agriculture is crucial to the story of agricultural development in the region.
However, these small-scale farmers tend to be among the poorest people in Latin America, and lack secure access to land, technologies, financial services and markets.
Ensuring broader, successful adoption of innovative agricultural technology solutions in Latin America will, in part, depend on uptake by the 14 million smallholder farmers.
Only then can they be properly implemented and appropriately scaled.
This is in fact, the biggest challenge for Latin American startups: innovators need to promote consistent adoption of technology solutions across a number of actors, with limited resources.
Nur
: What roles need to be played by both the public and the private sector to make sure that AgTech innovators actually drive productivity and social needs forward?
Pratima
: On the public sector side, we see the need for greater policy action.
Despite Agri-food systems going above and beyond their contribution to a country’s GDP, the region lacks strong policy frameworks and there’s a need for further public action to promote long term planning in the agricultural sector. Insufficient financing from both the public and private sector slows the pace of development.
To enable agricultural productivity at scale, countries in the region need to develop policy frameworks that aim to strengthen agricultural value chains. An effective policy framework would set goals to increase access to technology, tools and training, thereby empowering farmers and producers along the value chain to be more efficient, productive and act as better custodians of the region's natural resources.
In addition to the need for a policy framework, there is a very real need for investments in Latin America to enable the development of agrifood technologies.  Policy makers need to focus on public sector investments in public goods such as rural infrastructure, agricultural research and development, strengthened standards, and enforcement of those standards.
Spending by the private sector could add significantly to the overall commitment to research and development
and speed important gains in yield and drought tolerance, pest resistance, and help improve the nutrient value of crops, making food healthier and increasing efficiency of food production systems.
Global investors are starting to recognise the need to bring farming from the industrial age into the digital one. In 2021, they invested 51.7 billion dollars in agrifood technology financing.
However, a major investment opportunity is being overlooked in Latin America.
Despite the clear need and the inflow of investment money, the region ranks last in agrifood technology investments with just $440m being invested in 152 deals over the last 5 years
Nur
: It’s clear that additional public and private sector financing is a key driver to advance the future of agricultural production. Could you talk more about what increased financing ought to go towards?
Pratima
Private sector investment can, for example, help further research for better irrigation systems, mechanisation for crop production and post-harvest processing and storage, as well as encourage innovation in animal health and nutrition. Many of these technologies current investments global investors are funding focus on increasing food yields, reducing the burden to the environment, maintaining farm viability and responding to consumer demand for quality foods.
There is also a considerable need for
further investment in extension services that enable technology transfer and delivery t
o ensure the technical innovations and know-how are sufficiently distributed. This is an area that is particularly key for ensuring smallholder farmers can take advantage of budding technical innovations.
Poor transport systems, and underdeveloped infrastructure make the need for
investments in transport and logistics increasingly essential.
For example: In 2013, record harvests in Brazil resulted in lines of more than 20 kilometres on roads leading into port facilities and hundreds of ships waiting to load, with delays in some ports of more than a month.
Other improvements that are needed include better development of critical irrigation systems and electric utilities
, which are both essential for scaling up farming operations.
Nur
:
Let’s talk about what’s already going on in-situ. What are a few examples of agrifood tech projects or businesses in the region that this financing would go towards?
Pratima
: Generally
agrifood technology solutions are considered to be in either “pre-farm” “on-farm” or “post-farm” category, and in Latin America, post-farm technologies are most prevalent,
closely followed by on-farm solutions.
The goal of pre-farm activities is to
improve yields and incomes, prevent further land from being converted for cultivation and ensure farmers can thrive in the face of climate change and unpredictable conditions.
Pre-farm activities can range from crop genetic research and development to easing the administrative processes required to begin agricultural operations.
A start up based in Brazil called Bart Digital found that the most bureaucratic and complex operations happen during the negotiation between rural producers and input companies. The startup aims to digitise this process that occurs at the pre-farm stage, helping small shareholders better manage the bureaucratic processes to level the playing field.
On-farm activities focus on the actual growing and harvesting, and combating challenges such as damage to crops due to pests, disease, severe and unpredictable weather, and the question of how to manage food loss, ensuring quality control, high productivity and yields, and sustainable practices.
For example, the Space AG company, which was previously a drone company, evolved to develop and supply a range of tools to increase crop productivity and make better use of satellite images and drone photos. These tools detect irrigation deficiency and other anomalies, identify and quantify dead plants, project crop yields, and determine and pinpoint productive or non-productive areas, and these are all visible to the farmer in a smartphone or computer app.
Post-farm opportunities target activities in the marketplace, matching supply and demand, reducing waste and integrating byproducts into the market.
Agree, an Argentinian agrifood technology startup founded in 2017 focuses on buying, trading, and selling grains and their by-products, all on a blockchain.
Climate-focused projects are also increasingly prevalent in Latin America.
For example, In Ecuador, a climate-smart livestock project on 800 farms allowed roughly 1,000 small farmers to increase their milk production, augment their income by 40%, improve the quality of the soils in 40 thousand hectares, and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 20%, avoiding more than 24 thousand tons of greenhouse gas..
Sustainable, productivity-enhancing agrifood technology projects and companies in the region at the pre-farm, on- farm and post-farm stages
highlight the increasing innovation happening in the region.
Nur:
This last part about climate-focused projects is interesting. Here at the PB we’ve been flagging the clean energy transition as a major long-term theme for our clients, and beyond that, more than 60% of our client base is worried and interested in an ESG overlay to their portfolios. However, farming is not usually very ESG friendly. How can agrifood tech investments help address a sustainable development of the region’s available resources?
Pratima
: Although the region accounts for just 13 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions,
Latin America is the second-largest producer of agricultural emissions globally,
surpassed only by Asia.
Agriculture uses over one-third of the region’s land area, consumes nearly three-quarters of the region’s freshwater resources,
and generates almost one-half of the region’s greenhouse gas emissions.
The current rate of resource use poses a significant threat to the region’s global public goods contribution.
Though there have been some farmers making strides to adopt green technology,
many Latin American food systems are dominated by production models based on unsustainable practices.
These production models threaten the viability of Latin America’s food production capacity, generate greenhouse gas emissions, and pose a risk to the long term viability of the agricultural market.
There is a clear need to replace these unsustainable farming practices with better models that ensure the sustainability of the region’s natural resources.
More green-friendly practices not only are ecologically beneficial, but
improved environmental management is key for solidifying Latin America’s dominant position in global food markets.
If ecosystems cannot deliver key services such as water regulation, micro- and global climate stabilisation, nutrient cycling, pollination, soil retention, and sedimentation control, agricultural productivity dramatically declines and the region will not be able to hold its global position.
Encouragingly, there is a clear trend in Latin America and the Caribbean towards addressing pressing environmental issues.
Nur:
Thank you for sharing these findings and insights with us. I’m Mexican, a country that boasts impressive natural resources but also, shamefully, one of the highest levels of inequality in the region. This, unfortunately, should resonate with many of my fellow Latin Americans. However, the solutions that we just discussed today give me hope that there is a way out. LatAm is already and should take, going forward, an even greater role as the world’s breadbasket, but ensuring agricultural production in the region is both sustainable and maximally productive and will require new innovations in the space.
The Agrifood tech developments you discussed are one such way to address these challenges, but these technologies need to be developed to ensure both large-scale production and smallholder farms can adopt at scale.
A key point discussed is that further investment in agrifood tech is essential. The region has been overlooked, and there is missed opportunity for financing these technological developments. Additional financing flows can help address the unique challenges of the region and lead to a scaling up of innovation, and subsequently of agricultural supply, to match the increasing demand, creating economic gains for both investors and the region. And finally, political willingness needs to be there with the proper regulations put in place to foster greater participation in the space.
Pratima:
Precisely. Thank you, Nur for hosting me today and for facilitating this conversation.
Nur:

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.There are long-term investing opportunities aligned with policymakers’ priorities in energy transition, food security and defense.War-time economics is complex, and Europe’s economy seems to be short circuiting. A perilous energy crisis has pushed inflation to record levels, is squeezing households, and threatens to worsen in the cold winter months ahead.
Import prices are soaring. Consumer confidence is the weakest it’s been since the European Union (EU) started tracking it. Business sentiment is weakening. The European Central Bank (ECB) is trying to do what it can. Governments are looking to crisis-management strategies: price caps, excess profits taxes and rationing.
Avoiding recession will be difficult. Yet profound disruption also brings investing opportunities.
Can Europe avoid a recession?
Whether or not Europe can steer clear of recession lies in how the energy crisis is managed.
The war in Ukraine and sanctions against Russia have upended Europe’s energy supplies. Russia was the continent’s traditional source for a quarter of its oil and almost 40% of its natural gas. Households and businesses need gas for heating, cooking and powering electricity. But transporting gas now is tricky, and high demand relative to limited supply has sent prices out of control.
European natural gas, even with a recent move lower, is still trading more than 60% higher
*
than a year ago. The EU succeeded over the summer in refilling its stockpiles of liquified natural gas (LNG), mostly from the United States, hoping to avoid rationing this winter. (Storage currently stands at average levels, meaning close to 90%.)
The real challenge will come in 2023.
Russia continues to limit the flow of natural gas to the continent—most recently through the closure of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline—and has given no indication of when the supply will resume. Despite higher LNG shipments from elsewhere, storage levels for winter 2023 are likely well short of what will be needed. Moreover, a colder than expected winter this year could draw heavily on reserves and exacerbate the shortage.The war represents a large “terms of trade” shock to the eurozone economy, in which import prices have surged disproportionately to export prices. Such large price fluctuations this winter could worsen the war’s economic fallout across the region.
Energy exporters, including the United States and Canada, should benefit. They will almost certainly be satisfying Europe’s energy needs for many years as Europe pivots away from Russian imports.The nearly 7% decline in the eurozone’s terms of trade since the start of the war could, in isolation, wipe away about one-third to a half of the GDP growth that would have occurred in 2022 and 2023 had the war not broken out. Risks to this projection are also skewed to the downside, particularly if the energy situation proves disorderly and disrupts European industrial sectors, particularly in Germany, where growth is more reliant on manufacturing and trade.
The challenges of monetary policy
Such a terms of trade shock pushes inflation higher, squeezes incomes and hurts a country’s reserves and external debt. Such conditions make designing policy solutions all the more challenging.
Higher energy prices have to be paid for by corporations passing on the costs to customers and governments potentially providing subsidies, caps or stimulus to help people pay the bills. But with risks skewed toward a worsening crisis, price caps and subsidies could prove insufficient. Rationing that stamps out demand may be needed to build sufficient energy supplies for next year.
At the same time, the ECB, like the Federal Reserve, is expected to continue to tighten policy in order to have a fighting chance at price stability. Yet because the eurozone is a monetary union, there is more at risk as the ECB goes on the offensive. As credit conditions tighten, the more indebted nations, including Italy, will feel the effects more acutely than wealthier member states such as Germany.
The danger is that ECB policy will fail to transmit across all members effectively and will fragment the single market. The spread between Italian and German government debt (an indication of funding stresses in the periphery versus central Europe) is hovering around its highest levels since the depths of the COVID-19 crisis.
Emerging investment opportunities in Europe
Some investment strategies can thrive in a downturn.
The euro has depreciated meaningfully, falling 12% versus the U.S. dollar year-to-date and below parity for the first time in two decades. For example, Europe is suddenly “cheap” for American tourists. Indeed, the number of tourists visiting Europe this past summer soared to pre-pandemic levels.A cheap euro should buffet Europe’s economy from the war shock in the short run, set the stage for faster growth in export sectors over the medium term, and eventually help to adjust Europe’s economy.
Given that currencies tend to “overshoot” when external shocks inflict damage on economies, now could be an opportune moment for U.S. dollar–based investors to pick up euros at historically depressed levels, or to consider investments in European real assets, such as real estate and infrastructure.
At the same time, the stresses related to the current crisis and COVID-19 aftershocks have made it difficult for many Europe-based companies to maintain their profits and service their debts. Loan defaults are already on the rise. A window appears to be opening for investors with expertise in special situations to acquire at a discount and restructure troubled credit and real estate assets. Such strategies can also generate yield in portfolios and returns with an opportunity for downside protection.
And investing opportunities aligned with policymakers’ priorities—around themes such as the energy transition, food security and defense—could offer long-term investors growth at a time when it is scarce.

As of October 6, 2022.This chart shows the 7-day average of Russian natural gas exports to Europe in millions of cubic meters per day from January 2019 to September 2022. In January 2019, the level is about 500 million cubic meters per day, made up of 170 million of Russian exports via Ukraine, 100 million via Yamal (Poland), 160 million via Nord Stream 1, and 60 million through liquefied natural gas (LNG). This then transitions to circa 400 in July 2019, as Nord Stream 1 annual maintenance takes its export contribution to zero. We see a series high of around 550 million at the end of 2019, largely due to a jump in exports via Ukraine to 230 million cubic meters. This then drops sharply to approximately 330 million in early 2020, as exports via Ukraine, Yamal and LNG fell. This then jumps to 490 million in late 2020 following another sharp decline in July due to the Nord Stream 1 maintenance. Since then, Russian exports to Europe have fallen quite consistently. Noticeably, there is a drop to around 200 million in January 2022, followed by a rise to around 350 million in early 2022 before a dramatic fall to just 61 million cubic meters at the end of the series. This final contribution is made up of no flows via Nord Stream 1, 43 million via Ukraine, and 18 million via LNG.   Alt text: This stacked area chart shows the 7-day average of Russian natural gas exports to Europe in millions of cubic meters per day from January 2019 to September 2022.This chart shows the European natural gas storage levels as a percentage of capacity from January 2021 to September 2022, with an estimate for capacity in October 2022. Capacity in January 2021 is at 72%, from where it falls to 30% in April 2021. There is then a steady rise through the summer to 77% in October 2021. Levels then drop through the winter to a series low of 25% in March 2022. Since then, capacity has risen to current levels of 89% at the end of the series.This chart shows terms of trade balance in the United States, Canada and Europe from December 2019 to August 2022, indexed at 100 on December 2019. Initially, the United States remains fairly flat, while Canada faces a negative shock down to 91 by May 2020, and the Eurozone rises to 106 in the same month. From there, Canada rises sharply over the next two years to a high of 120 before dipping to 117 at the end of the series (July 2022). The U.S. terms of trade steadily increases to finish at 108 in August 2022. And the eurozone gradually declines from highs of 106 in May 2020 to 89 in June 2022 to end the series.This chart shows the real effective exchange rate (REER) of the euro divided by the REER of the dollar from January 1993 to August 2022. A high figure suggests the euro is stronger relative to the dollar, while a low number denotes a stronger dollar. The series starts at 1.0, before dipping below 0.9 in January 1994 and bouncing higher again above 1.0 in July 1995. From here, there is a sharp decline to 0.6 in June 2001, followed by a strong period to a series high of 1.08 in April 2008. The EUR/USD REER then bounces between 0.9 and 1.0 until May 2014, where the series fall sharply to 0.7 by January 2016. Then, there is a move slightly higher to 0.8 in January 2021 before a sharp decline to 0.61 in August 2022.Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Learn how your investments can better align with your philanthropic visions, without compromise.Across the United States, this time of year heralds a period of reflection and a chance to consider making charitable gifts—a practice that has inspired the term “Giving Season.” Many families are gathering to discuss the causes they wish to support—and how to extend the impact of their capital.
Giving Season can be a great opportunity for families to articulate, share and model their values—particularly across generations.
However, philanthropy isn’t the only place where you can express your values with your capital. Many of the most popular giving themes from our clients can be amplified through a suite of market-rate sustainable investments.
1
Some of the most popular giving themes center around education, climate change and social justice —all of which have sustainable investment opportunities. Here are some examples of how you can amplify your philanthropic goals and potentially generate positive returns.
Education
Do you give to your alma mater, a scholarship fund or some other educational cause? You also might want to consider investing in market-rate bonds that finance student loans and educational facilities. You might even be eligible to receive tax credits if you purchase these securities within your own state of residence.
The mechanics of supporting student loans are relatively straightforward. Each year, students and their families look for ways to make up any shortfalls between their financial aid packages and their tuition costs—a challenge that has only intensified as rising fees have outstripped the pace of inflation. In fact, nearly 30–40% of all undergraduate students take out loans, making student loan debt (which now totals USD 1.75 trillion
2
) the second-largest consumer debt category after mortgages. Banks and other entities finance these loans, and then sell the loans into the bond market so they can free up space on their balance sheets to continue originating loans for others.
Similarly, schools often tap into the bond market to help pay for capital improvements (such as new dorms, classrooms and other educational facilities). These bonds are often issued through local nonprofits, development authorities and public agencies, and take the form of tax-exempt municipal (muni) offerings. If you live in a state that provides dedicated tax advantages for investors buying local muni bonds, you may be able to buy these tax-exempt bonds and simultaneously support educational institutions in your own community.
Environment
Has your charitable giving to environmental causes increased in recent years? If you make donations to nonprofits that help to mitigate climate change and promote biodiversity, you might want to invest in market-rate companies that support the same causes but also provide compelling financial returns.
The recent Inflation Reduction Act allocated over $380 billion to energy and climate investments, which is creating tailwinds for environmental investments across the country. Some of these investments will land on the supply side of the equation, supporting technologies that harness wind and solar power more effectively. Others will be designed to meet growing consumer demand for less carbon-intensive technologies (such as electric vehicles, efficient appliances and “smart” buildings).
Historically, companies that participated in the development of clean energy technologies were relatively small and early stage, so the only way to invest in them was through private equity. Now—with the industry maturing rapidly—many of the strongest performers are publicly listed.
For families focused on protecting intergenerational wealth, the energy transition represents a particularly compelling opportunity to pursue growth in their equity portfolios. Although these types of investments can be volatile, they can also represent durable, intergenerational megatrends that we expect to see play out over an extended time horizon.
Diversity, equity and inclusion
The fastest-growing focus for charitable giving is social justice, which became a focal point for philanthropy in May 2020, as protests swirled in the United States over police brutality and institutionalized racism. Since then, increasing awareness of the need for diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) in the workplace has begun to catalyze change across corporate America.
If you support social justice through your philanthropy, you may want to consider funding more diverse investment managers—as well as managers who prioritize diversity. Some investment managers, for example, are pushing their investees to publicly disclose the diversity of their staff, and others are filing shareholder resolutions that demand their investees undergo comprehensive Racial Equity Audits.
In many cases, these efforts are being launched through the lens of financial materiality. The demographics of America’s consumer base are changing rapidly, and some investors say that companies won’t be able to meet the needs of that changing consumer base if they fail to hire employees who reflect those same shifts.
Over time, diverse managers have delivered notably strong results. According to a research study released in November 2021 by the National Association of Investment Companies (NAIC), diverse private equity managers’ funds outperformed the industry benchmark in 76.5% of the vintage years studied.

A season to reflect
Like seasonal giving, sustainable investing can give your family an opportunity to discuss and express your values through your capital. Best of all, these investments can simultaneously work to support your values
and
your financial goals: Historical returns from sustainable investing show that these opportunities can match market returns—and in some cases, even generate alpha.
4
As a family, you can also monitor how closely companies match your own philanthropic aims: New tools are emerging that will allow you to track sustainable investment metrics over time—much in the same way that financial reporting requires the disclosure of auditable, historical results, year over year. While this market development is still very new, it is being driven by consumer demand and regulatory initiatives, creating an environment in which it may be easier than ever to align your charitable and financial goals.

Reruns
. When bear markets occur and the investment mistakes of the prior cycle are revealed, bearish investment commentary tends to intensify. There is a confessional, self-flagellating quality to some of this research, as if its authors are trying to atone for having missed the signals and risks during the prior boom. I read around 1,500 pages of research each week and the most consistent message now is a litany of gloom on earnings, valuations, wage and price inflation, Central Bank policy normalization, housing, trade, energy, the surge in the US$, China COVID policy, etc. I am not saying that these things are not important, since of course they are (see Appendix charts). But for investors, there is a remarkable consistency to the patterns shown below:
equities tend to bottom several months (at least) before the rest of the victims of a recession.
Let’s start with the Eisenhower recession, which is notable for the lack of monetary and fiscal stimulus deployed in what at the time was a pretty severe recession. Equities bottomed in December 1957, while earnings did not bottom until a year later.  GDP and payrolls also didn’t start to improve until the middle of 1958. You will see the same pattern during the 1970’s stagflation, the 1980’s double dip recession, the S&L crisis of the 1990’s, the Global Financial Crisis and the COVID pandemic.The Dotcom collapse is the outlier: the earnings decline
preceded
the equity market decline, there was barely a recession at all, and the mini-recession of 0.3% preceded the equity market bottom by more than a year.
As for the latest bear market, it appears on the right.
I see no reason why this cycle will not end up looking like most of the other ones.
If so, the bottom in equities will occur even as news on profits, GDP and payrolls continues to get worse.  When will that be?  We will be watching the ISM manufacturing survey very closely.  It has a good track record of roughly coinciding with equity market bottoms, as shown in the table. I would consider 3200-3300 on the S&P 500 index good value for long term investors, if such levels were reached sometime this fall/winter.Thucydides Trap update: US semiconductor policy on China deepens the rift
In May 2018, I published the chart below on economic ties between the US and China as a counterpoint to Graham Allison’s “Thucydides Trap” book. Allison’s work analyzed rising empires competing for power with incumbents.  By Allison’s account, in 12 of 16 historical examples, competing empires ended up in military conflict, and Allison sees the US-China relationship as a rerun of these precedents.  My chart was meant to highlight the unique economic ties between the US and China when compared to historical adversaries.   As things stand now, certain fragments of the US-China relationship support my thesis: US imports from China in 2021 reached $540 billion (close to the pre-trade war peak in 2018), and China still holds ~$1 trillion of US Treasuries and Agencies.  However, the latest developments on US semiconductor policy do not support it, and represent the most comprehensive change in US-China trade policy in decades.The Trump administration took steps against ZTE and Huawei but left open the possibility of future engagement, perhaps in exchange for Chinese cooperation in other geopolitical areas.
The latest moves by the Biden administration appear to close those doors, and for a very long time
. A summary of the latest US actions
1
:
The new semiconductor policies focus on four areas in which the US has a current strategic advantage over China: AI chip designs, electronic design automation software, semiconductor manufacturing equipment and related equipment components
There are four interlocking elements of the new policy
: (1) impede China’s AI industry by restricting access to high-end AI chips; (2) block China from designing AI chips domestically by cutting off China’s access to US-made chip design software; (3) block China from manufacturing advanced chips by cutting off access to US-built semiconductor manufacturing equipment; and (4) block China from domestically producing semiconductor manufacturing equipment by cutting off access to US-built components
China’s fusion of military and civil activities make it difficult to target the former without affecting the latter (prior bans on the sale of high-end Intel Xeon chips to China’s military didn’t work, since shell companies reportedly acted as an intermediary; Chinas military is reportedly still actively using US chip technology
2
)
The new policy: high-end AI chips can no longer be sold to any entity operating in China, whether that is the Chinese military, a Chinese tech company or a US company operating a data center in China. The new rules set a performance standard of what kind of chips can be sold; anything above that level requires an export license from the Dep’t of Commerce which may be subject to “presumption of denial”
The US is invoking something called the “foreign direct product rule”. The best way to explain it is to give an example of how it works.
Any chip manufacturing operation anywhere in the world that seeks to build high end Chinese chip designs will risk losing its access to US semiconductor manufacturing equipment
. As a result, Chinese chip design companies will not be able to outsource manufacturing abroad for advanced AI and supercomputing chips, and for the 28 Chinese organizations on the BIS Entity List, they will be blocked from outsourcing the manufacturing of any types of chips at all. [Note: Almost every advanced semiconductor fabrication facility in the world is critically dependent on US technology companies for initial purchase and ongoing onsite advice, troubleshooting and repair]
New licensing requirements for logic chip equipment sales for chips at 16 nanometers (nm) or less ends up blocking the sale of equipment to China that is several years old and already in use. For DRAM (short term memory) the limit will be 18 nm, and for NAND (long term memory) the limits are 128 layers and higher. Translating the semiconductor jargon: the new policies threaten the viability of some of China’s largest memory chip companies (some of whom have been hoarding as much US made equipment as they can)
These policies also require all “US persons” (citizens, residents and green card holders) to obtain a license to continue working on development, production or use of integrated circuits at certain Chinese semiconductor facilities
The scale and scope of these restrictions do appear to be unprecedented. While they only apply to a subset of high performance AI-related chips right now (such as those sold by NVIDIA which accounts for 95% of AI chip sales in China), the new chip performance benchmarks are being held constant.
In other words, over time, more and more of the semiconductor market will be subject to these restrictions.
These new policies complement the recently passed CHIPS Act and its $52 billion for US semiconductor research, manufacturing and workforce development.
What might happen now?
US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan gave a speech last month that suggests that this may not be a one-time thing
3
:
“Earlier this year, the United States and our allies and partners levied on Russia the most stringent technology restrictions ever imposed on a major economy. These measures have inflicted tremendous costs, forcing Russia to use chips from dishwashers in its military equipment.
This has demonstrated that technology export controls can be more than just a preventative tool. If implemented in a way that is robust, durable, and comprehensive, they can be a new strategic asset in the US and allied toolkit to impose costs on adversaries, and even over time degrade their battlefield capabilities
”.

.The Pitcairn Problem: the limited relevance of most small countries with high shares of renewable energy
More reruns: yet another article on tiny countries with high shares of renewable power generation as paragons of the future that are “leading the way” on sustainability without any mention of the factors that limit their relevance for larger developed and developing economies.  The latest piece is on Uruguay, from the New York Times
5
.  What’s missing is the broader context of how to understand Uruguay, Iceland, Norway, Costa Rica and other “Pitcairn” examples
6
.
Such countries generally have small shares of global GDP, small populations and lower population density.  Low density countries face fewer challenges in terms of siting low density wind and solar power
They tend to be much smaller in terms of land area, an important consideration when thinking about the cost of transmission investment to load centers required for onshore and offshore wind, and solar power
They often have lower economic complexity (a measure of a country’s ability to produce a wide range of complex products across industries), which requires less developed energy systems
Most have abundant hydroelectric resources which contribute the lion’s share of electricity generation.   Developed countries have already built out most of their suitable hydroelectric resources
Some have unique geothermal resources (Iceland, Costa Rica, New Zealand), or sugarcane-based biomass whose energy return on investment (“EROI”) is 7x higher than corn-based ethanol (Guatemala and Uruguay)
Uruguay is interesting in its use of biomass for backup power when wind conditions are low, and in this regard it shares a lot in common with Denmark, another small country with excellent coastal wind resources (40% capacity factors, similar to Uruguay) that uses biomass (manure, wood waste, energy crops and industrial feedstock) as a replacement for thermal power.  Both small countries also benefit from proximity to much larger ones for grid stabilization services (Uruguay and Brazil, Denmark and Germany)
The combination of these attributes generally makes the Pitcairn group of countries much less relevant for larger, industrialized, urbanized countries.  Most of the latter are pursuing a renewable future based more on wind and solar power, which requires raw materials, project siting, transmission investment and plenty of backup thermal power.  More on all of this in next year’s energy paper.Appendix charts: market indicators are generally downbeat1

MR. MICHAEL CEMBALEST: Morning everybody and welcome to the October Eye on the Market. This one’s called Reruns, because there are three topics that I’m covering here that for investors are things that we’ve seen before or thought about before, talked about before. First one is on US equity markets, the second one is on the clash between US and China, and the third one is on renewable energy.
So let’s talk about equity markets first. When bear markets happen and the investment mistakes of the prior cycle get revealed, all of a sudden you tend to see bearish investment commentary intensify. And it’s almost like there’s a confessional aspect to some of this research, as if the people that write it are trying to atone for having missed some of the signals and risks during the prior cycle.
And I read a lot of research, maybe 1,500, 2,000 pages of research a week. And there’s a very consistent message right now that’s very bearish on earnings, valuations, inflation, central bank policy, housing, trade, energy, the surge of the dollar. I’m not saying that these things don’t matter, of course they do, we’ve been talking about them for a while. But at some point, the more markets go down, you have to start to shift your focus from the risks to the cycle to the shift in the cycle. And look, we spent a lot of time talking about young unprofitable companies, Fed mistakes, garbage SPACs, crypto, metaverse, et cetera, 18 months ago. But by the time a lot of assets reprice, it’s time to start shifting our focus towards where things go from here.
And that’s why I wanted to show a whole bunch of these charts. There’s a remarkable consistency. Equities tend to bottom several months, at least, before a lot of other things do during recessions. And I certainly do think the chances of a recession are quite high over the next few quarters, given what going on with Fed policy.
But let’s take a look at some of these things and start with the Eisenhower recession in the 70s, which was a pretty severe one, and also had not a lot of monetary and physical air drops associated with it. Equities bottomed in December in 1957, and GDP bottomed six, seven months later and then payrolls and then earnings bottomed. And by the time a lot of those GDP and payrolls and earnings and things like that were getting better, the equity markets were already up pretty substantially.
And so there’s a bunch of charts in here for the, as I mentioned, the Eisenhower recession, the stagflation era of the 1970s, the double-dip recession in the 80s, the S&L crisis in the 90s, the global financial crisis 12 years ago, and then the COVID pandemic. In each one of these, the patterns were the same. The equity markets go down first, and then a whole bunch of things go down later.
And so I just want to make sure as investors, that we and you are focused on the equity markets and how they tend to discount in terms of time and magnitude, the declines and other things. So we’ll be following payrolls and we’ll be following the decline in earnings, which is certainly coming, and we’ll be following the decline in GDP. But it’s very important to understand that in almost every cycle, the decline in equity markets predates that by quite a bit.
And if we had to pick a single variable that does coincide with the bottom in equity markets, it happens to be the ISM manufacturing survey. We’ve talked about this before. If there were any one variable that you had to hang your hat on, the ISM has the closest coincident timing with the bottom in equity markets. And in most cycles, they bought them together within one or two months of each other. The only exception here was the dot-com bubble, recession collapse, where everything was all mixed up. The equity bottom actually happened after the recession and after the decline in earnings. So that’s the one outlier here.
But I have no reason to believe that this cycle is going to be very different from the other six of them. So we’ll be watching the ISM survey closely, has a really good track record of coinciding with equity market bottoms, and I would consider something like 3,200 to 3,300 on the S&P index if we got there sometime this fall or winter, pretty good value for long-term investors.
The second rerun topic is the US and China. And what I mean by rerun is there was a book by Graham Allison. I forgot what year it was written, but it was called The Thucydides Trap. And it had to do with how rising empires compete for power with incumbent empires. And by his account, in 12 of 16 historical examples, competing empires end up in military conflicts with each other. And obviously he’s writing this book as a parallel to the current US/China relationship.
I published a chart at the time when the book came out showing the economic ties between the US and China through bilateral central bank holdings, foreign direct investment and trade that were much higher than all sorts of historical examples.  And my chart was meant to highlight how these unique economic ties between the US and China were different and could end up with a different outcome.
And as things stand now, there are certain aspects of the US/China relationship that are still supporting that general thesis.  In 2021, despite the Trump tariffs, the US imported $540 billion of goods from China, which was almost the same as the pre-trade war peak in 2018.  And China still holds about a trillion dollars of US treasuries and agencies.
So certain aspects of the US/China relationship are still intact.  Obviously others are not.  There’s been a lot of things changing about the Committee for Foreign Investment in the United States and all sorts of policies affecting bilateral flows.  And the latest salvo from the US is probably the way that a lot of people see it who watch this stuff closely, the most comprehensive change in US/China trade policy in decades, and it has to do with semiconductors.
So when you look at what the Trump Administration did and the steps they took against Huawei, they left open the possibility of future engagement maybe in exchange for Chinese cooperation on other geopolitical areas.  But these latest moves by the Biden administration may close those doors for quite a long time.
So there are four interlocking elements of this new policy, and they all have to do with semiconductors, and specifically the high-end, high-performance semiconductors, where the US has a strategic advantage over China.  So the elements of this new policy are to impede China’s artificial intelligence industry by restricting access to high-end chips to block China from designing those chips domestically by cutting off access to our chip design software, to block China from manufacturing the chips by cutting off access to semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and then to block China from producing the equipment by cutting off access to components.  So it’s a pretty comprehensive policy.
And essentially what the policy states is that high-end chips can no longer be sold to any entity operating in China, whether it’s the Chinese military, a Chinese tech company, or a US company operating at a data center in China.  And export licenses will be needed and according to the Department of Commerce, a lot of these requests are going to be subject to the presumption of denial.
And so we go through a little bit more of the details here.  There’s an excellent piece from the Center for Strategic and International Studies that goes through a lot of the details, and we summarize that here.  The bottom line is that some of the new policies are pretty restrictive.  Any chip manufacturing operation anywhere in the world that seeks to build high-end chip designs will end up, may end up losing its access to US semiconductor, manufacturing, equipment, support, advice, repair, et cetera.
So this is a pretty big deal.  Some of the policies only apply to super-high-end chips, but the performance standards are being held constant.  So over time, more and more of the semiconductor markets going to be subject to these restrictions.  And when you read the comments from National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, it makes it pretty clear that the US is looking at these kinds of things as a new strategic asset in the US toolkit, which he describes as imposing costs on adversaries and even over time, degrading their battlefield capabilities.
And what’s up next, there’s talk of restrictions on US entities investing capital in Chinese technology companies as the focus shifts from the transfer of technology to the transfer of capital.  We wrote a paper in our institutional business.  We have a strategic advisory investment committee and we write one or two papers a year, and the last one was on de-globalization.  And this certainly is another element in the de-globalization, in the gradual de-globalization that’s taking place, all of which has the potential to raise the cost of goods and services in places that are trying to now rebuild and re-onshore all sorts of production and supply chain capability.
The last rerun topic is on renewable energy and what I’m calling the Pitcairn problem, which are press articles that you see all the time on tiny countries that have very high shares of renewable power generation, mentioning them as paragons of the future that are leading the way on sustainability, without mentioning any of the factors that limit their relevance for everybody else, and specifically for the larger developed and developing economies.
The latest example of this is a piece in The New York Times on Uruguay, which was a great read and very interesting.  The problem is it was completely missing, as these articles usually do, the broader context of how to understand countries like Uruguay, Iceland, Norway, Costa Rica, and other similar tiny places in terms of how they’re getting these high shares of renewable power generation.
So first of all, most of these countries tend to have very small shares of global GDP, very small populations, and low population density.  They also tend to have lower economic complexity, which measures a country’s ability to produce a wide range of goods and services.  That means they need less developed energy systems.
They also tend to be pretty small in terms of land area, which is a very important consideration when you think about the transmission investment required to bring wind and solar power to where the load centers are.  So it’s one thing to build wind on the shore of Denmark to power things in Denmark.  It’s another thing to build wind in certain places in the United States and have to transmit that to where the load centers are; it’s very different.
But the biggest issues are the ones that don’t get discussed enough.  If you find a country that has anywhere, 40, 50, 60, 70% renewable shares, chances are it gets the lion’s share of its electricity generation from hydroelectric power.  And most developed, and even a lot of developing countries have already built out their suitable hydroelectric resources, and so it can be very misleading to be talking about these paragons of renewable generation that happen to be small little places with spectacular hydroelectric resources.
Some of the other ones have really unique geothermal resources, like Iceland, Costa Rica, and New Zealand, or they have a lot of sugar cane-based biomass.  And the reason that it’s important to specify sugar cane is that sugar cane-based biomass has seven or eight times more energy per unit of investment than corn ethanol does, and Guatemala and Uruguay are examples of that.
So the combination of all these attributes makes this little Pitcairn group of countries much less relevant for everybody else.  They’re interesting to learn about.  But the big developed and developing countries in the world are pursuing a renewable energy future based not on hydroelectric and not on geothermal and not on sugar cane-based biomass, but on a lot more wind and solar power and maybe some of that being used to produce hydrogen, all of which requires a lot of raw materials, a lot of critical minerals, a lot of project- siting, a lot of transmission investment, and plenty of backup thermal power for when those other things are working.
So more of that on, more of all of this in next year’s energy paper.  But I did want you to, everyone to understand the limitations of some of these smaller countries and their relevance for everybody else.  And there are some tables in here with lots of statistics that you might find interesting.
So that’s enough for now.  We will probably talk to you again after the midterms, which I don’t really expect to be much of a market-moving event compared to everything else that’s going on with the Fed and the pending recession, declining earnings, and everything else.  So thanks for listening, see you next time.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Cross Asset Strategy
Over the first week in August, hawkish remarks from several Fed policymakers drove U.S. treasury yields higher across the curve. The 10-year jumped 20 bps on Tuesday alone, while the two-year climbed back above 3%. That said, U.S. equities continued to respond well to a better than feared earnings season, particularly from the important mega cap tech companies, which delivered resilient results and solid guidance. Low investor positioning in equities continued to drive the market higher. While positive on a 12 month basis, U.S. equities are near our year-end outlook and the risk/reward is less favorable at current levels. We continue to expect that earnings need to be revised lower, and believe expectations of an imminent Fed pivot to support growth vs. taming inflation are premature. The next few months could remain choppy in equities as we digest these negative earnings revisions and the gyrating moves in interest rates.In Asia, risk sentiment was pressured by rising Taiwan tensions, causing stocks across the region to tumble. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index dropped below the critical 20,000 level before bouncing back later in the week.
While the rally seems to be carrying on into August, equities are still faced with multiple challenges amid a synchronized growth slowdown and hawkish central banks. Here’s our view on the outlook…
Strategy question: Are we really past peak inflation and Fed hawkishness?
Over the past month U.S. equities have rallied and largely offset the losses in June post the shock 9.1% CPI print. One key driver of the rally was the Fed’s signalling the size of rate hikes could decline going forward and data highlighting rapidly declining growth in the U.S. These were taken by markets as signs that we’re near or at peak inflation and past the peak in Fed hakwishness.  As we mentioned in
last week’s note
, the Fed acknowledged this backdrop of slowing growth in their policy statement. While their primary focus is still on getting inflation back to target, in the press conference they hinted that the worst of the tightening cycle is probably over. Near record-low investor equity positioning and the decline in long-dated Treasury yields particularly benefited long-duration assets and contributed to the technology sector’s meaningful outperformance.
Following the moves, a meaningful growth slowdown is in the price, but an average recession is no longer ‘priced in’. High-yield (HY) credit spreads continue to look tight/low, relative to the decline in equity markets. Furthermore, utilities and consumer staples appear historically expensive relative to the YTD increase in bond yields; and this is where many investors have been hiding out this year. We prefer healthcare for similar defensive exposure at more attractive valuations.On the economy, rate hikes are having their intended impact.
The housing and goods sectors are going through a substantial slowdown. Together, they dragged second quarter GDP down by ~1.8%. While we don’t think that we are already in a recession (given the strong labor market), looking forward, our economic momentum indicators continue to deteriorate across all sectors of the economy. Even in noisy, short-term windows we do not see economic momentum bottoming. We increase the odds of the U.S. being in recession over the next 12 months as 50% (up from 40-45% previously). Upcoming inflation prints will be the key factor determining whether the Fed can tone down its hiking path. And while there are some signs core inflation may be peaking, there is considerable uncertainty particularly around wages and rents. That being said, in addition to core inflation, the Fed is also concerned with high headline inflation and the possibility that it may spill over into higher inflation expectations. Until this concern is more clearly off the table, the Fed will likely continue on its current hawkish path in raising interest rates.Given the negative growth outlook, we continue to stay defensive in equities.
We expect a range-bound market as economic uncertainty and negative revisions work through equity markets. We have been concerned about inventory levels in consumer goods and are hearing of a more significant slowdown than expected. Negative revisions will likely pick up over the next four months. The magnitude of the cuts will be determined by the amount of demand curtailed by higher rates and the crowding out of demand destroyed by inflation. Estimate revisions are a necessary part of creating a durable bottom in equity markets. As estimates drop, investors will likely become more anxious to get more engaged. We have slightly reduced our expectations for 2022/23 earnings. Since probability of a recession is around 50% from here, equities could follow different trajectories under each scenario:
In a soft landing scenario, we see the S&P 500 at ~4,500 at mid-2023 despite lowering our 2023 earnings estimate to $233 (from $240 prior and versus consensus of $248). The change reflects our economic assumptions, lower margin expectations, and a reduction in share buyback activity. The S&P 500 at 4,500 represents ~9% price appreciation from the level at the time of writing; that potential return is certainly high enough to stay invested, but for marginal dollars we see better risk-adjusted returns in corporate hybrids and structured notes.
In a recessionary scenario, the S&P 500 could decline to 3,500-3,600. Under this scenario, the outlook for 2023 earnings potentially falls to ~$195-$205. Until we get more clarity on the macro picture, we stick with our preferred sectors: healthcare, industrials, and reasonably-priced tech.
In addition, heightened volatility is likely to remain as market transitions occur. We view this as an opportunity to utilize options and structured notes that can provide deep protection with better than average terms.
One of our highest conviction ideas continues to be fixed income
. There are clear signs that yields will peak from here and that return profiles would be asymmetric for investors (i.e. gains from lower yields will be higher than losses from higher yields). We expect strong portfolio downside protection in the case of a recession and to still perform well in a soft landing. Yes, there are short-term risks if inflation remains sticky, but the potential losses in such a stagflationary scenario are dwarfed by the potential gains if the long end rallies in a downturn.
In our view, corporate hybrids may have the potential for equity like returns that rival historic realized S&P 500 total returns. These securities sit between debt and equity in a company’s capital structure; as a result investors get higher yields than an issuer’s senior bonds, due to the subordination, and less risk than the common equity. YTD spreads have widened to over 400bps (or several standard deviations from the mean), offering compelling carry with yields to worst now ~7%. Since 2012, when spreads were above 400bps (only 4% of the observations), 12-month forward median returns were >20%.All market and economic data as of August 4, 2022 and sourced from Bloomberg Finance L.P. and FactSet unless otherwise stated.

Index definition:
Standard and Poor’s 500 Index
is a capitalization-weighted index of 500 stocks. The index is designed to measure performance of the broad domestic economy through changes in the aggregate market value of 500 stocks representing all major industries. The index was developed with a base level of 10 for the 1941–43 base period.
The Hang Seng Index (HSI)
is a free float-adjusted market-capitalization-weighted stock-market index in Hong Kong. It is used to record and monitor daily changes of the largest companies of the Hong Kong stock market and is the main indicator of the overall market performance in Hong Kong.
For illustrative purposes only. This does not reflect the performance of any specific investment scenario and does not take into account various other factors which may impact actual performance.
Past performance is not a guarantee of future returns and investors may get back less than the amount invested. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.
• Callable / Putable Bonds - Callable Bonds have embedded call options which may be exercised by the Issuer, while Putable Bonds have embedded put options which may be exercised by the Investor. These events may result in early unscheduled return of principal on bonds. Investors should note that they may not able to reinvest the amounts received, into other suitable bonds with returns as favorable as that of the pre-existing bonds.
• Perpetual Bonds - Perpetual Bonds have no maturity date and pay a steady stream of interest rate forever. Thus these types of bonds usually have a particularly high duration and are very susceptible to fluctuations in interest rates as compared to normal bonds. Perpetual Bonds generally have lower liquidity and many different technical features. Investors need to exercise caution in dealing with Perpetual Bonds.
• High Yield Bonds - High Yield Bonds (with ratings at or below BB+/Ba1) carry higher risk since they are rated below investment grade, or could be unrated, which implies a higher risk of Issuer default. Further, the risk of rating downgrades is higher for High Yield Bonds in comparison to investment grade bonds.
• Convertible Bonds – Convertible Bonds give the bondholder an option to convert the notional of the bonds into common stock at a predetermined strike price. Hence, under certain circumstances, Convertible Bonds may have a risk profile that closely resembles that of common stock. Investors should note that they are subject to investment risks of both common stock and bonds.
• Contingent Capital / Convertible Bonds - Contingent Convertible Bonds have a contingent write down or loss absorption or conversion feature that allow the bonds to be written off, fully or partially, or converted to other type of assets on the occurrence of a trigger event. Hence, Investors holding Contingent Convertible Bonds are exposed to a higher Issuer credit risk in general and may lose the value of their investment substantially as a result of occurrence of the trigger event.
• Extendable Bonds – Extendable Bonds have extendable maturity dates and Investors would not have a definite schedule of principal repayment.
• Variable-Rate Bonds – Variable-Rate Bonds have variable and/or deferral of interest payment terms and Investors would face uncertainty over the amount and time of the interest payments to be received.
• Subordinated Bonds – Subordinated Bonds have subordinated ranking and in the event of liquidation or insolvency of the Issuer, Investors would only be entitled to be paid after other senior creditors are paid.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.While tech stocks outperformed during the Covid pandemic, they have fallen behind this year. Yet despite the slowing economy, tech remains an attractive sector for investors.Amid the global equity sell-off, the technology sector has underperformed over the past year. The substantial outperformance between 2016 and 2021 led to elevated valuations that, in many cases, could not be sustained in a higher interest rate environment.
Earnings estimates have also started to come down given the complicated dynamics of slowing economic growth, uneven demand, inventory management and gradually improving supply chains. If there is some good news, it’s that the expectations bar has been lowered, and stock performance in the third quarter was better than the first half of the year despite these revisions and higher interest rates.
In all, we remain positive on the Technology sector over the medium and long-term. Innovation, deflationary benefits and the constant incentive to digitize all businesses makes us believers.
Here, we share our thoughts on the sector moving forward.
Tech should keep its premium
Corporate spending on tech is solid and expected to remain so. Larger deals are taking a bit longer to close as CEOs and CFOs increasingly look at costs and the timing of returns on spending on upgrades. Foreign exchange volatility, specifically the strong dollar, is hurting sector growth disproportionately, while consumer spending on electronics is slowing.
As economies have weakened and interest rates risen, tech has burned off much of the Covid-induced valuation expansion. We see some short-term risk to these valuations but believe tech can maintain its premium as it was going through a positive rerating process before the pandemic. This process reflected the increased cash generation, capital deployment and growth that has been playing out over many years.
Further, tech operating and free cash flow margins have been expanding faster than the broad market for some time, helping the sector gain prominence (weighting) in the S&P 500. Investors are being rewarded as the companies have significantly increased their return of capital through both dividends and buybacks (figure 1).
The dividend payout ratio, below 10% in the early 2000s, is now well over 20%, significantly narrowing the gap with the overall market. As a result, the dividend yield for tech has also risen, even when taking into account the significant price appreciation. That said, growing buybacks and dividends means that tech now returns near all of its cash generation to shareholders, a marked increase from 20 years ago.Under the surface: Our view on technology’s subsectors
The tech sector comprises a large and diverse universe of different companies working in many areas of the global economy. To help inform our investment thinking, it’s worth exploring the prospects for the main subsectors.
Semiconductors
The largest negative earnings revisions are coming from semiconductors. The firms with exposure to the consumer are faced with inventories rising as demand moved towards non-tech (food, energy and travel).Of the growing number of tech companies lowering third-quarter earnings, a few have been semiconductor companies that have lowered guidance by over 10% including Intel, Micron and Nvidia.We expect further cuts as inventories remain high for many products due to supply chain inefficiency post-Covid.
Semiconductors make up over 20% of the tech sector and we believe this one of the best segments in the market over the long term (figure 2). Despite the short-term adjustment as consumer demand slows and inventories re-balance, we expect more opportunities to present themselves, addressing these large market themes. Strategically (think 3-5 years), re-shoring of manufacturing will be a major positive for semi cap equipment manufacturers.Software
At around 30%, the software industry is the largest sector within tech. Over the years, the recurring and steady nature of cash flows has resulted in an uplift to revenues, margins and earnings while increasing business predictability. The companies tend not to be capital intensive, generating high free-cash-flow margins.
However, the recent stock experience has been painful, with software valuations down significantly. Unfortunately, despite the excellent free cash flow generation for the sub-sector, valuations are held captive by interest rates. The greatest corrections have been suffered by those firms with the highest growth and most elevated valuations.
Fintech and IT services
At around 16% of the total sector, this group of stocks is a mix of steady growth firms and disruptors looking to capitalise on the shift to cashless transactions. The segment used to trade at a much higher relative valuation given the consistency of growth, but after a wave of consolidation, many of the names have become deep value as free cash flow missed expectations in 2021.
In addition, the disruptors disappointed as post-pandemic reopening slowed the penetration of ecommerce-related activities. The segment traded at a 40% premium to the market during its peak in mid-2021 but has now declined to around a 20% premium, which is in line with the long-term average.
Hardware and communications equipment
This segment is the second-largest tech industry group makes up 24% of S&P 500 Tech. This segment is dominated by Apple, which comprises around 85% of S&P500 Hardware & Equipment. Valuations for the hardware segment look high and negative revisions are likely for most of the consumer-facing companies, which leaves us less positive about the outlook for this group.
The YUCs (young, unprofitable companies)
Expensive, profitless tech has had the worst ride of all (figure 3). While much of the tech sector’s experience has been like a rollercoaster, with ups and downs, the YUCs have been more like an elevator – generally in one direction and quick to rise or fall. At their peak performance in early 2021, they had produced a return nearly 4.5 times that of the market since the period just before Covid began.
Since the start of 2020, the YUCs have underperformed the S&P 500 while producing meagre absolute returns that are barely positive. While valuations have corrected, we believe the market will still place a heavy emphasis on profitability. When financial conditions peak, this group may be ready to ride the elevator “up”.Conclusion: Tech maintains its shine
Tech has de-rated substantially from historically elevated valuations as rising interest rates have compressed multiples across the board. The slowing global economy is impacting the more cyclical areas within tech, making the short term treacherous. But we hold fast in our belief that tech continues to be an attractive sector for medium- to long-term investing. As earnings estimates come down, we remind investors to look through short-term revisions and focus on the sector’s superior growth profile.
Investing thematically accentuates less cyclical parts of the market. We believe cybersecurity remains an excellent area within tech for less cyclical growth. Data centre investments and digitisation growth could slow slightly but the trends are not going away. Meanwhile, events in Ukraine highlight the need for the manufacturing independence of key products within country borders, making “re-shoring” another key theme for tech investors.

As the industry moves from analog to digital, “big data” in healthcare is set to explode. Advanced diagnostics will power the shift from treatment to prevention. Personalized medicine will lead to targeted therapies that are right for the individual. Meanwhile, a focus on enhanced aging is expected to increase longevity.
From a societal perspective, the implications of these trends are exhilarating. It seems the door is opening to new ways to treat, cure or prevent devastating diseases such as influenza and cancer that cause hundreds of thousands,
1
even millions, of deaths
2
every year.
Implications for portfolios are also profound. All of these trends are investible on their own, and together they form a compelling universe of choices for investors.
We are here to help you navigate these new, and rapidly changing, investment opportunities.
Driving healthcare innovation
The key drivers of today’s healthcare innovation are technology, public funding and demographic pressure:
Technology
—Cheaper processing power, cloud computing and the growing sophistication of artificial intelligence (AI) are all helping accelerate innovation.
Public funding
—Healthcare also benefits from significant government research efforts, which often generate entirely new lines of medical advancement.
3
Demographic pressure
—As the number of people over the age of 60 in the advanced world rises from 326 million today to an expected 405 million in 2040,
4
the market for longevity and wellness innovation of all sorts is sure to grow, luring more capital into the industry and speeding innovations. Meanwhile, the market for more efficient treatments is likely to balloon, due to pressure on government budgets.
5
Also reshaping the market are patients’ increasing expectations of customization and at-home delivery of services.
Key trends in healthcare now
Already we are seeing great responses to these drivers, and the coming years could bring new treatments and diagnostics that may change not only how we defeat various diseases, but also our perceptions of some medical prognoses.
Particularly exciting are such recent advancements as:
Messenger RNA (mRNA) technology
—The world quickly became familiar with mRNA vaccines as companies such as Moderna, BioNTech and Pfizer used this technology to create lifesaving COVID-19 vaccines.
It’s expected that mRNA vaccines will be used to fight many other diseases as well.
Researchers at Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) are working on an mRNA vaccine to treat cancer.
6
Companies such as Sanofi, GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer are researching using mRNA vaccines to combat the seasonal flu more quickly and efficiently than traditional vaccines.
7
Other companies, GreenLight Biosciences among them, are using mRNA technology to both create disease fighters and sustainable alternatives to common pesticides and herbicides.
8
Advanced diagnostics and analytics
—Recent developments in medical diagnostics have shown the promise of changing how diseases are detected, allowing them to be identified in early stages before developing into serious health threats.
New testing and diagnostic methods, such as liquid biopsies, show particular potential to improve cancer detection. Current methods include expensive and time-consuming tests such as computerized tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs). Liquid biopsies may be an alternative that is non-invasive, quick, precise and relatively inexpensive.
9
A liquid biopsy takes a blood sample from the patient and searches for cancer cells or pieces of DNA from tumor cells in the blood—potentially before tumors are seen on CT scans or MRIs. Multiple blood samples over time may help identify changes in a tumor during treatment. Perhaps the biggest benefit: Such tests are expected to be conducted at home by a home-care nurse, and could soon be at an accessible price point for mass adoption.
10
In addition, there are promising advances in the analysis of clinical trial data. Companies, such as IQVIA, use software to integrate data and technology around clinical trials to expedite the development process for pharmaceutical researchers. The future of healthcare innovation is likely to rely on a surge of new data from clinical trials and testing,
11
so platforms that allow researchers to analyze the data more efficiently will be crucial to the discovery of new drugs.
The ability to analyze vast datasets will become paramount to discovering treatments designed specifically for individual patients based on their medical histories.
Medical devices—
Health monitoring is being reshaped. Fitness trackers have already brought low-cost general health recording to the masses.
12
Now, devices focused on specific health concerns (such as glucose monitoring) are becoming more available. We expect to see the trend of wearable medical devices to increase and help build the global health data sphere available to researchers, further accelerating innovation and discovery of new treatments.Precision medicine
—Precision medicine is revolutionizing the treatment and potential curing of diseases. It uses a patient’s full medical profile (from genetic data, medical history, environmental factors and even lifestyle) to create a customized, unique treatment and prevention protocol for that individual. As the cost of mapping the genome plummets, a detailed understanding of each person can move to the center of healthcare.

Whenever there are high expectations of a powerful and investable trend, there are always risks to be considered.
As powerful as a trend might be, if a starting valuation is incredibly high, the company’s future earnings growth may not be strong enough to deliver a positive return to investors. This tendency is magnified when businesses are generating losses at the time you are investing. And currently, many innovative healthcare companies are generating losses.
So as exciting as some of these early-stage innovators can be, they can reduce a portfolio’s risk and volatility to balance exposure to those front-line firms with others that are larger, more stable and established, but which are still involved in these innovative trends.
Also note that there is significant clinical trial risk in parts of healthcare, such as therapeutic innovation (and to a lesser extent medical devices). To reduce risk in this area, it may be advisable to invest in companies that have strategic partnerships with large, established firms.
Indeed, “platform” companies that help manufacture (rather than create) new drugs may provide a more predictable set of cash flows for investors, while still delivering exposure to the innovative drug market.
In addition, and speaking more broadly, worth noting are two persistent, potential risks in healthcare investments:
Increased regulation,
which may slow drug and device development, or reduce the profitability of existing patents
—However, the industry has escaped significant regulatory impact in recent quarters, even when risks appeared to be manifesting. For example, although the Biden administration proposed a COVID-19 vaccine patent waiver, there has not been much action or significant progress toward actually enacting a vaccine waiver.
Price controls
of new drugs in the United States that are often well above the level charged in other countries
—This concern came to the forefront last year when some lawmakers pointed at the $56,000 price tag for the newly approved Alzheimer’s treatment Aduhelm. Still, even that criticism has not been as sharp as many expected. Getting wide support for new drug pricing regulation may be more difficult than many may have anticipated.

For example, in the United States, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which has been the source of many medical breakthroughs, received almost $42 billion in the 2020 budget. Also, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) was instrumental in developing mRNA vaccines. In October 2013, DARPA awarded Moderna up to approximately $25 million to research and develop potential mRNA medicines as a part of DARPA’s Autonomous Diagnostics to Enable Prevention and Therapeutics (ADEPT) program, which assists in the development of technologies that rapidly identify and respond to threats posed by natural and engineered diseases and toxins. That $25 million award followed an initial award from DARPA given in March 2013. The DARPA awards have been deployed primarily in support of vaccine and antibody programs to protect against the mosquito-spread Chikungunya viral infection.

The annual data encompasses historical data for 2016 through 2020, and forecasts for 2021 through 2030. Total wearables shipments in 2016 reached just below 100 million. Shipments gradually rise consistently through 2030 to reach about 600 million shipments. The breakdown of smartwatches and fitness trackers in 2016 is roughly evenly split. But smartwatch shipments grow at a consistently faster rate that fitness trackers during the years shown. By 2022, smartwatches account for about 2/3 of all wearables shipped. By 2030, of the total 600 million wearables shipped, smartwatches account for roughly 425 million compared to the 175 million fitness trackers.This charts shows the cost of sequencing a genome in U.S. dollars from 2001 through 2019, as well as a separate data point for 2022. The dollar amount is shown in log scale in the Y axis. The price of sequencing a genome stood at approximately $100 million in 2001. The cost steadily declined through the time series. By 2007, the cost had fallen to close to $10 million. In 2013, the cost fell to around $10,000. In 2019, the cost was around $1,000. The most recent data point shows a cost of $200. Illumina, a gene sequencing company, hopes to further lower the cost of sequencing the human genome in the coming years and hopes to achieve a cost as low as $100.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Latin American investors should anticipate shifting demands from high- to low-emission industriesClimate change is reshaping the global economy, affecting production in industries that are highly dependent on natural resources and changing consumer demands. As countries aim to curb greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and consumers seek more sustainable products and services, demand is shifting away from high-emission industries toward more sustainable alternatives. Global investors are recognising this opportunity: Sustainable funds attracted a record US$69.2bn in net flows in 2021, a 35% increase over 2020, when the previous record was set.
1
However, investors have yet to fully recognise the opportunity presented by the net-zero transition in Latin America. Currently, the region only contributes to 2% of global green bond issuance.
2
With immense natural capital and a growing urban population, Latin America stands to become a crucial player in the green economy. From sustainable agriculture to clean energy and transport, investment in low-emission industries and ecosystem services can become an avenue of long-term growth for Latin American investors. This article explores how the demand for low-carbon alternatives is creating investment opportunities in some of Latin America’s key economic sectors, which also capitalise on the region’s unique natural assets. Our research found that:
The net-zero transition could reduce the estimated oil and gas production by 2050, as reduced dependency on fossil fuels accelerates the adoption of renewable energies.
Issuance of green bonds in Latin America more than doubled in the last two years and is helping finance renewable energy, transportation and land-use projects.
Investment in agricultural technologies and sustainable practices could help the sector adapt to shifting demands by enhancing crop yields, address food waste and improve livestock farming.
The Amazon Basin, one of the few carbon sinks in the world, contributes to the region’s vast carbon sequestration potential, positioning it as a leader in the voluntary carbon credit markets.
Shifts in Demand and Geopolitical Risks in Energy Markets Create Opportunities for Renewables Energy
To limit climate change’s impacts, countries must pursue net-zero emissions, balancing the amount of GHGs produced and removed. Achieving net-zero will require countries to shift demand from carbon-intensive operations to lower-emission alternatives. In the energy sector, which is currently the source of 46% of Latin American emissions, this would require relying less on fossil fuels and increasing demand for renewable electricity generation, hydrogen and biofuels.
3
,
4
This shift would challenge the oil and gas industry, which historically has contributed a significant percentage of the region’s GDP. Estimates suggest that by 2050, oil and gas production volumes could be 55% and 70% lower than today.
5
The region has already seen a steady decline in revenue from oil over the past decade. On average, oil rent
6
in Latin America represents 1.7% of GDP compared with 3% in 2010. For countries such as Mexico, revenue from oil has more than halved in the past 10 years (see Figure 1).The sharp increase of oil and gas prices and the mounting geopolitical risks associated with dependency on fossil fuels could accelerate renewable energy adoption. Amid stock losses because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, renewables are outperforming, as power prices jump and investors seek energy alternatives.
8
As industries phase out fossil fuels, Latin America will have to undergo an energy transformation. This shift will require sizable investments in renewable and clean energy sources, representing a long-term opportunity for investors.
Issuance of Green Bonds in Latin America has More than Doubled in Two Years, Enabling the Region’s Net-Zero Transition
Putting a number to this transformation, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) estimates that the cumulative investment opportunity for renewable energy infrastructure in the region amounts to US$555bn by 2030, more than 12% of the region’s current GDP.
9
Major asset funds with ESG mandates, insurers and pension funds are contributing to the growth of burgeoning green bond market in the region. Green bonds, which are debt instruments created to fund projects that have positive environmental and/or climate benefits, have become a cornerstone of environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment. Issuance of green bonds in Latin America more than doubled in less than two years—from US$13.6bn in September 2019 to US$30.2bn at the end of June 2021.
10
Half of these funds are dedicated to renewable energy projects (mainly solar and wind).
Brazil is the region’s largest green bond market, with US$10.3bn in cumulative issuance, followed by Chile (US$9.5bn) and Mexico (US$4bn). Several new countries have entered the green bond market over the past two years—Barbados, Bermuda, Ecuador and Panama—bringing the total number of green issuer countries in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) to 14.
11
However, the market is still nascent. LAC only contributes to 2% of global green bond issuance, compared with 40% from Europe.
12
While energy is the most funded sector in the green bond market, there are several other industries that present opportunities in the net-zero economy, including transport and land use (see Figure 2). In Chile, for example, most of the recently issued government bonds are for green transport, including Santiago’s Metropolitan Public Transport System’s new Metro subway lines.
13
Land use, a significantly underfunded sector globally, represents over 10% of LAC issuance. The majority of these bonds fund certified agriculture, forestry and paper-related projects, especially from Brazil. However, there are other important sectors that remain unexplored. Buildings and water, two of the most funded sectors globally, are among the most lacking categories in Latin America.
14The Rise of Low-Emission Industries Creates New Opportunities for Investment in the Region
Shifts in energy demand could also impact the agricultural sector, as biofuels are quickly becoming a high-growth sector. A report on the region’s demand for biofuels illustrates this trajectory. While exports of basic agricultural products from Latin America, such as vegetable oil, sugar and cereals, grew at annual rates below 4.5% in the last decade, the bio-based sectors with the highest added-value—biofuels, bioplastics and biofertilisers, grew on average  25%, 20% and 14% annually in the past five years, respectively.
16Increasing demand for biofuels might lead farmers to reduce cropland for food production and pasture land to give space to these profitable crops (see Figure 3).
18
In order to maintain food production, the region would have to invest in sustainable agriculture to enhance crop yields, address food waste and food traceability, and adapt technology to livestock farming.
19
New agricultural technologies (AgTech) could address a variety of problems across the sector, including new production systems, crop and animal protection and genetics, and food processing, logistics and distribution. AgTech also represents one of the most promising sectors for investors. In the United States, farm tech investing soared to US$7.9bn in 2020, topping 2019 investments by US$2.3bn, or 41%.
20
Within this, agricultural biotech companies attracted particular interest from investors, with 173 deals closed, up by 58%.
This sector has remained under the radar for Latin American investors, but the region would greatly benefit as one of the world’s largest agricultural producers.
21
Data from the Association for Private Capital Investment in Latin America show that there was US$35.4m in venture capital invested in AgTech across 15 disclosed rounds last year. The largest of these went to Colombia-based Frubana, a US$25m Series A round in early 2020.
22
However, there are over 450 startups in the region’s AgTech sector. Most of these are concentrated in Brazil (51%), Argentina (23%) and the Andean Region (18%), which are also some of the food baskets of the region. These startups are concentrated in the development of local solutions in areas such as big data and precision agriculture, management software, and platforms for buying and selling services and funding.
Latin America’s Sequestration Potential Positions it as a Leader in the Carbon Credit Market
In addition to clean energy, demand for carbon offsets could impact land-use distribution in the region, as the value of forests increases due to their carbon sequestration potential. Carbon sinks are areas that store more CO
2
than they release, and Latin America is home to one of the few remaining net carbon sinks in the world: the Amazon Basin, which stretches across eight countries
23
and removes 1.2 Gt of CO
2
a year.
24
This is only part of the region’s potential. By simply allowing established forests to grow for another 40 years, Latin America would be able to potentially absorb up to 31 billion tons of CO
2
out of the atmosphere—equivalent to the total carbon emissions from fossil fuel use and industrial processes in all of LAC from 1993 to 2014.
25
26
The region’s large carbon sequestration potential has led it to becoming the world’s second-largest provider of voluntary carbon credits, with just fewer than 20% of the total global credit supply coming from the region in 2020–21 (see Figure 4).The demand for carbon credits will continue to grow as countries tighten regulations to curb carbon emissions. In just the first half of 2021, the global voluntary carbon market saw a 60% increase compared with 2020, and by the end of 2021, the all-time market value for voluntary carbon is likely to reach US$6.7 bn. At this pace, recent analyses predict the voluntary carbon market demand will grow fivefold to tenfold over the next decade. This demand will be met in part through carbon credit issuances from Latin America–based projects. Europeans purchased 40% of their carbon offsets in 2019 from projects based in LAC.

Latin American countries are sitting on some of the most valuable carbon deposits in the world. The total carbon stock of the region amounts to over 3.9 trillion tonnes, with a value of over US$14.5trn based on the 40$/tCO
2
e set in the Paris Agreement. At this price level, the value of Brazil’s carbon stock amounts to tenfold its current GDP, while Bolivia’s carbon value is twofold and Colombia’s 80% (see Figure 5).Conclusion: A Network Effect Toward Net-Zero
Climate change represents an existential threat and, if left unaddressed, will have devastating environmental and economic impacts in Latin America. However, the transition to a net-zero economy also represents an opportunity for investors looking for long-term returns. The changes in demand from high-emitting goods and services to low-carbon alternatives could have a network effect that shifts resources from one industry to the other. Demand for low-carbon energy sources will affect not only the energy sector, but might also cascade into agriculture and land-use considerations. Other sustainable alternatives might have similar effects on a variety of industries, from waste management to water conservation. Investors who are able to anticipate these effects and make strategic investments will be able to reap the rewards.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.China is emerging from lockdowns and growth is beginning to bounce back. As a result, Chinese assets have been outperforming developed markets (DM) and emerging market (EM) peers. The A-shares benchmark CSI 300 has rebounded over 10% from its April lows, led by cyclical sectors. Global sentiment on China is also turning more positive with MSCI China outperforming the onshore market over the same period. The consensus outlook for stronger policy easing and relatively benign inflation puts China in a comparatively more positive light, especially when the rest of the world is struggling with stubbornly high inflation and rapidly tightening financial conditions. Global investors are now looking at China and see markets that have already sold off significantly, an economy with low-to-no inflation, along with policy loosening – and as a result are wondering if China is finally looking attractive.
However, the recovery from here may not be easy.
Compared with the rapid rebound from the initial Covid lockdowns two years ago, China is now faced with a much more challenging environment. Back in 2020, very strong exports and a vibrant housing market quickly drove the “V-shaped” recovery. These tailwinds no longer exist. As we pointed out in an
earlier note
, external demand may start to slow down as global growth decelerates and DM consumers shift spending from goods to services – and the sharp housing downturn induced by a regulatory crackdown in 2021 has not yet bottomed. In addition, domestic demand is still impaired. Growth in both goods and services consumption never recovered to pre-pandemic levels, even before the lockdowns in Q2 this year. May activity data suggested that frail consumers would be increasingly a key concern; in contrast to the quick rebound in industrial output as restrictions were lifted, consumption stayed very weak. Unless a fundamental shift in Covid strategy occurs, a significant gap in service consumption will likely remain and risks could emerge in the labor market, in turn further pushing back a full consumption recovery.
Under this backdrop, how China rebounds from the Covid shock in the second half will largely depend on two factors — 1) the scale of policy support that authorities deliver, and 2) whether China can avoid future lockdowns from successive Covid waves. The second factor is unpredictable and our base assumption is that Covid will likely cause future lockdowns and/or restrictions. That level of uncertainty will likely continue to weigh on growth, but for the purpose of this note we aim to cut through the noise and quantify stimulus measures that have been announced, explain what the constraints are (i.e. why China can’t stimulate the way it has in the past), and provide our outlook on China’s growth trajectory.
Quantifying stimulus – lots of announcements but how much actual spending? And will it be enough?
Authorities have been dialing up policy support with multiple announcements over the past few months. On the monetary side, the PBOC delivered several rate cuts across LPR, RRR[1], deposit rates and mortgage rates. Apart from lowering financing costs, the central bank also provided guidance on increasing the quantity of credit for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and highly impacted sectors. A number of fiscal measures have also been announced.
However, despite all the announcements, stimulus still appears piecemeal in the data. We generally advise investors to look through the announcements and follow the data when trying to understand the macro cycle in China. Looking at the monetary side, the credit impulse only picked up modestly from historical lows, highlighting both the lack of credit demand (businesses don’t want to borrow and invest with the uncertainty of lockdowns so high), and the targeted nature of policy easing thus far. Even with the tone from policymakers turning substantially more supportive since April, credit growth remained sluggish. As shown in the chart,
credit expansion reached well above 30% of GDP during both the 2015-16 and 2020 easing cycles, while the expansion has been substantially smaller this time
. This is important because economic activity tends to closely trail credit growth with a 2-3 quarter lag.Why is large monetary stimulus still absent?
A few reasons. First, the size of the easing is limited due to multiple constraints. Though measures have turned more supportive, the overall scale of the liquidity injection is not comparable to previous rounds of easing. The PBOC is in a difficult situation to balance growth and its other policy objectives. Tightening moves from major global central banks have squeezed its policy space – as historically the PBOC rarely eased during Fed hiking cycles due to concerns around currency stability and capital outflows. In addition, the Chinese central bank’s ability to ease is also restrained by other policy priorities around debt levels and the housing market. The overall leverage of the economy remains high and housing prices are still at unaffordable levels, and significant easing will inevitably exacerbate these issues.
Secondly, genuine demand for credit has been weak. While both social financing (TSF) and bank loans rebounded in May, detailed data suggests that business confidence among private sector and households remained exceptionally weak. Most of the increase in TSF came from stronger government financing as the Ministry of Finance vowed to complete the RMB 3.65 trillion local government special bond issuance by the end of June. In terms of corporate loans, while short-term lending rebounded, medium and long-term corporate loans continued to decline. Notably, the share of medium to long-term lending out of total corporate loans declined to 35% from over 70% a year ago. This likely signals a lack willingness among business owners to carry out longer-term expansion plans. Household loans (most of which are mortgages) also continued to plummet due to weak sentiment in the housing market.On the fiscal policy side, markets have high expectations of a fiscal bazooka to drive growth this year. So far, policies have been focused on two areas – 1) relief measures for corporates, including a record-size tax cut/rebate program, a deferral payment in social security contributions, and more; 2) infrastructure investments, financed by special purpose local government bond issuance (which saw a substantial pick up lately).
On the first point, the size of the tax cuts is equivalent to around 2% of GDP if the program is fully executed. Historically, the actual scale of tax/fee cuts carried out deviated from plans, and enforcement of local government spending can be lax.
On the second point, fiscal resources can potentially support a sizable infrastructure boost this year, but constraints remain. Infrastructure investment has stagnated since 2018 as authorities focused on containing the leverage levels of local governments. This year, policy guidance is pointing to high single-digit/low-teens percentage growth – a significant upgrade from past years. Fiscal resources for the infrastructure push could amount to approximately 5% of GDP, taking into account carry-over funds from last year (RMB 1.2 trillion), special bond issuance this year (RMB 3.65 trillion), policy bank credit lines (RMB 800 billion) and capital market financing (RMB 500 billion for railway construction and air transportation projects), which is a very sizable push. One of the biggest constraints would be finding the right projects to deploy that capital. After the massive infrastructure campaign that drove China’s double-digit growth over the past two decades, profitable projects with high clarity of future cash flows have become rare. Despite the central government providing guidance on relaxing approval criteria for new projects, local government officials are held accountable if project-related debts go into default, which raises questions about how encouraged they are to carry forward riskier projects. Five new projects have been approved so far this year – and while this is a significant improvement from last year, the acceleration is not fast enough for all fiscal resources to be deployed.Over the two most recent easing cycles in China, expansion of the “augmented” government deficit has been around 7% of GDP
.  If the above-mentioned measures are fully deployed, the scale of fiscal support this year could be comparable. That said, uncertainties around enforcement remain
. Last year, only two-thirds of funds raised were utilized, mostly due to on-and-off lockdowns. In terms of infrastructure, it is obviously not an easy job to implement large construction projects when there is a pandemic. In addition, while fiscal resources appear to be abundant, constraints may emerge given the sharp decline in local government land sales proceeds, drag from mass testing programs, and weak revenues. China can hardly just print money as they have in the past, for fear of outflows and sharper currency depreciation. This isn’t the China of 2008 or 2012 or even 2015. There is less room, and supply-side policies will be less effective. As we mentioned above, weak consumption will likely remain a drag. The most effective form of stimulus would be direct money to households, but so far that is completely absent from policy discussions.Looking ahead, we could still see some additional easing measures, i.e. additional special government bond quotas, a further step-up of PBOC lending facilities, further housing market relaxations, etc.
However, due to the constraints we discussed, the size of the overall policy stimulus is unlikely to match previous easing cycles. We are also concerned that in the absence of a clear Covid exit roadmap, overall sentiment will likely remain weak and further easing could be rendered less effective.
How could this stimulus impact the rest of the world?
Contrary to popular belief, infrastructure investment is traditionally not a clear positive for commodities, in contrast to housing investment, which boosts steel and iron ore consumption. Given the varying types of planned projects – such as water, sewage, data centers – differ from traditional infrastructure, their flow-on effects to commodities will likely be minimal. As such, we could see a near-term boost to oil from a pick-up in China demand as domestic travel improves, but other commodities are unlikely to be significantly affected. Housing is a different story. Property investment has historically been a strong driver of commodity demand, but we are not expecting a rebound there.
As growth across the world slows, can China’s stimulus prevent a global recession? Not likely. China’s easing plans are mostly geared towards additional supply, to the extent that it curbs inflationary pressures and allows central banks to take their foot off the brakes. That could help, but the pressures that exist globally center on wages, rents, and services spending – none of which is helped by extra Chinese manufacturing capacity.Conclusion: difficult to be complacent over the growth outlook
As long as Covid exists and as long as China is pursuing Zero Covid and the consequential rolling lockdowns – weak consumer sentiment and weak business investment are our base case. Moving away from the Zero Covid strategy entails some economic pain and potential social instability, but should we see positive signs of durable opening, markets could see any move positively and rally on the back of reduced uncertainty.
Longer-term, we also see Covid as accelerating China’s structural slowdown. China’s growth was always set for a structural slowdown due to declining demographic trends and over-investment and debt. The question was how quickly that process would happen. Just as the pandemic is accelerating other ongoing trends in digitization, work from home, or de-carbonization, the pandemic appears to be accelerating China’s shift to a slower growth trend. We’re seeing higher debt levels, a lower propensity to consume, weaker returns on investment, and declining productivity. Many of the statist economic policies of the past couple of years have accelerated the productivity slowdown. If not reversed, these could set China on a chronically weaker growth path. Avoiding “inflated” growth, as described by policymakers and applauded by global financial analysts, is undoubtedly positive, but however it’s described, it means China is facing a meaningful structural slowdown.
Investment implications
In terms of equities, macro uncertainties and lockdowns in the second quarter have led us to reduce our earnings estimates by 10-11% for both 2022 and 2023. As a consequence, we reduced our MSCI China base case target to 69-73, assuming a forward P/E multiple of 11x (vs a 5-year average of 12x). Our preference over the last 12 months has been for the China onshore market where there are significantly lower regulatory risks (both domestic and internationally), and more companies that benefit from longer term government initiatives such as de-carbonization.
Increasingly, there are reasons to become more positive on the offshore equity market.
While our earnings estimates are 6/9% below consensus for 2022/2023, we are increasingly of the opinion that our revised earnings estimates are achievable for 2022 and could mark the earnings trough. In addition, earnings growth post 2Q22 may see an accelerating trend given very easy comparable earnings in 2021. More importantly, there also seems to be some tangible thawing of the regulatory uncertainties facing Chinese internet companies over the past 18 months. While there is no full resolution regarding the U.S. ADR delisting issue, there is dialogue on both sides and some progress seems to have been made. In addition, local authorities approved a further 60 mobile games in June, a step-up compared to the 45 approved in April, which increases the chances of a more normalized level of gaming approvals in the future. Finally, while unsubstantiated, there have been press reports that DiDi may have the ban on new users in China lifted, and their app available for download again soon. We could potentially see Ant Group re-starting their IPO process. Sentiment towards Chinese equities have also started to become less negative due to the change in regulatory tone of late. If the recent regulatory news flow turns out to be true, our MSCI China target would skew towards our bull case of 85-89 and we suspect that mid-high single digit pullbacks in the MSCI China index would likely be bought.
For bonds, we continue to remain cautious.
Due to the clear policy divergence between the PBOC and the Fed, investors are moving away from China credits to DM in order to capture higher yields. For offshore credits, the property fallout is still ongoing as housing sales continued to decline, and we could see more distress in the sector as we approach maturity walls in July and August. Property weakness is also a source of downside risks to financials and SOE credits with revenue exposure to the sector, potentially leading to wider spreads. For investors looking for opportunities in this space, credits issued by large-cap tech firms are becoming more attractive given the recent improvement in the regulatory environment and attractive carry.
For RMB, we could still see some further weakness against the dollar.
The drivers for RMB strength over the past two years further faded as the current account surplus showed signs of peaking, interest rate differentials versus DM yields reversed and growth concerns increased. In addition, the PBOC may be incentivized to tolerate a weaker RMB to further ease conditions, which could be the reason why we saw limited interventions from the central bank as the currency weakened over the past months. Our outlook for USD-CNH by the end of this year is 6.80 (midpoint of the range 6.70-6.90).[1]

U.S. equities rallied on the week to a one-month high on the back of solid earnings. Both the real and digital economy saw bright spots from the earnings reports released so far, which stood in contrast to the dim expectations of the market. The tech-heavy NASDAQ outperformed the broad market. Bonds and commodities were relatively muted, with the 10-year Treasury yield stabilizing at around the 3% level. We think volatility may stay elevated as recession concerns linger, and see 3,500 – 3,600 as a more reasonable entry level for the S&P 500 (see detailed analysis in the previous Asia Strategy Weekly).
Nonetheless, Europe seems to be the focus of the week. The ECB held its policy meeting on Thursday, hiking the interest rate by 50 bps. It was the first hike delivered by the central bank since 2011 – in the midst of the European sovereign debt crisis. Since then, the ECB cut its policy rate all the way to zero, subsequently bringing the region into an era of negative interest rates in 2014. The ECB was increasingly an island before this meeting, being one of the only central banks that had put monetary policy on hold. Because of widening interest rate differentials and the precarious growth outlook due to the war in Ukraine, the Euro had briefly touched parity with the dollar before rebounding to 1.02 on Thursday. Energy shortages and fragmentation risk remain major challenges. That said, we see EURUSD at 1.05 by year-end as the movement of EUR rates back into positive territory may encourage flows.
Strategy question: Is mortgage non-payment China’s Lehman Moment?
It’s déjà vu all over again in China’s property sector. If last summer was marked by the (yet unresolved) Evergrande saga, this summer mortgage non-repayments are sparking a new source of unease. Over the past two weeks, homebuyers of unfinished residential properties indicated their intention to boycott their mortgage payments. The number of projects involved has since been rising every day, reaching 300 across 50 cities at the time of writing.
Reminiscent of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis that originated from a wave of mortgage defaults, many are asking whether this is China’s Lehman moment? First, it’s important to note there are a number structural differences between the two. The most important being the level of household leverage. The U.S. subprime crisis was built up on highly leveraged buyers paying very low down-payments (low single digit or even zero). In China, however, effective loan-to-value ratio is much lower at around 40% (see chart) meaning down payments and other sources of financing make up a much larger portion of the purchase. Banks also benefit from a larger buffer against potential credit losses.
Additionally, financial derivatives in the mortgage space is not as advanced, thus contagion risks due to mortgage defaults could be relatively limited. Though a key difference lies in the structure of balance sheets – when a homebuyer in the US defaulted there was at least an asset (the home) for banks to seize and auction; whereas in China if homebuyers default on an unfinished property the banks don’t have an asset to seize in many cases other than a barely finished property, making the risks slightly skewed to the banks.At this moment, the direct impact from the mortgage non-payment saga still looks manageable. We do not see systemic risks as an imminent concern just yet. So far, 17 major banks have responded with statements that their exposure to the affected mortgages remain minimal on their balance sheets. According to estimates by J.P. Morgan Investment Bank, about 20% of mortgage loans are collateralized by work-in-progress projects; assuming 20% of pre-sold projects see delayed delivery and 50% of affected homebuyers suspend their mortgage payments, the mortgage non-performing loan (NPL) ratio could rise by around 200 bps on average, leading to a material, but manageable drag on the banking system.
That said, the potential risks could go beyond the missing mortgage payments. While it is still too early to call, some worry that it could be just the tip of the iceberg. We will likely see stricter control on access to funds in the escrow accounts, which could further deteriorate the liquidity of the developers, among which many are already in distress. More importantly, if mismanaged, the wave of boycotts may further dampen homebuyer confidence, leading to further downside in housing sales and investment, and potentially a negative feedback loop affecting even healthier property developers. As shown in the below chart, key housing market indicators have been in a 40-50% decline year-on-year during Q2, and a further collapse could increasingly threaten the overall property-related asset quality on banks’ balance sheets (i.e. loans to developers and their suppliers). Furthermore, if concerns reach beyond construction suspension and more people join the boycott on various grounds (i.e. we’ve seen some suppliers/contractors halt debt payments due to payment delays by developers), the situation could get worse.The impact of further contagion on the macro environment could be material, as property-related industries account for roughly 30% of the country’s GDP. China’s Q2 GDP slowed to 0.4% year-on-year from 4.8% in Q1, largely due to the severe disruptions from the Omicron-induced lockdowns in April and May. As we wrote in
a previous note
, while the worst of the lockdown impact is behind us, recovery in 2H may not be easy. Constraints on policy easing and lingering Covid impact would weigh on growth, and weakness in the property sector seems to be a persistent drag on the recovery. Furthermore, if land sales further collapse due to property weakness, cash flows to local governments and their financing vehicles could suffer. This could disrupt Beijing’s stimulus plans, which rely on local governments to deliver infrastructure investment.
The key to watch from here is whether we see effective government interventions. Over the weekend, China’s banking regulator came out to reassure the market and encourage banks to provide credit to eligible developers to help them deliver the homes. In addition, the authorities are reportedly considering payment holiday for mortgages of delayed projects. A comprehensive plan to help resolve suspended constructions and deliver the pre-sale properties would be needed to restore confidence. There are recent reports that Henan province is considering a bailout fund and gathering SOE developers to help complete unfinished projects.  In the longer term, a thorough review of pre-sale property regulations might be needed to mitigate systemic risks.
What does it mean for investors?
With the fluid situation on the ground, volatility in the property and banking sectors will likely remain elevated. For equities, negative earnings impact and media coverage will likely continue to drag on trading sentiment for both sectors in the near term. For the property sector, with contract sales underperforming and the overall slow progress of asset disposals, the number of unfinished projects are expected to go up. Homebuyers will likely be more cautious about buying unfinished projects from financially fragile and non-SOE developers. SOEs and private developers with solid credit metrics will likely enjoy market share gains, although this has largely been priced in given the resilience in their share prices. Before more effective government interventions kick in, we believe it is still too early to ‘bottom fish’ China property stocks. For the banking sector, a rise in project suspensions would lead to higher NPL formation in developer loans, thus dragging banks’ earnings, especially those with fast mortgage loan growth and large mortgage loan sizes. Investors could also become more cautious on SOE banks that may need to provide uneconomic assistance to developers for the “greater good”.From a fixed income perspective, we maintain our bearish view towards China property credits, as we may see more distress in the sector with another maturity wall coming in August and September. As for bank credits, asset quality headwinds may lead to a further widening of spreads. Despite the fact that large state-owned banks generally enjoy robust solvency ratios, risks are skewed to the downside with rising credit impairment from mortgage exposures. In addition, valuations still look unattractive as spreads remain tight, while global peers have seen spreads widen significantly over the past months.All market and economic data as of July 21, 2022 and sourced from Bloomberg Finance L.P. and FactSet unless otherwise stated.

The rally in U.S. equities took a breather over the past week. The preliminary PMI prints – both manufacturing and services – missed expectations, and notably, the services print fell to 44.1 (versus 47.3 in July), which is the weakest reading since the lockdowns in the early stage of the pandemic. Sluggish new orders were the main driver. While PMIs (i.e. surveys of purchasing managers) capture sentiment rather than actual activity (which is still robust as indicated by hard data), it is another sign that the economy is losing steam and growth will likely continue to slow down from here. The strategy question today will explore equity hedging – a topic that fits well with what the macro data is telling us.
High energy prices continue to be a focus. Brent crude oil spiked over $100/bbl following talks of a possible reduction in OPEC+ supply and persistent Russian supply worries. The Euro dipped below par against the dollar at the start of the week, and growth concerns in Europe are emanating from the ever-rising natural gas prices, as well as widened yield differentials that have led to a double-digit loss in the currency this year. The weakness in the Euro may last longer (and are at risk of moving even lower) as the market awaits more clarity on how the energy crisis may evolve from here. While we’ve been saying that the dollar is nearing its most overvalued level in decades – with growth revisions still moving lower among the major trade counterparts of the U.S. (i.e. Europe and China) – it’s hard to see much downside in the short term.
Strategy Question: Is it time to hedge your equity exposure?
The S&P 500 is 13% higher than its low in June, at the time of writing. Other than the better than expected Q2 earnings results, equities were also boosted by expectations that peak Fed hawkishness may be behind us. The 10-year treasury yield went down to a low of 2.58% earlier this month from the close to 3.5% high in mid June, which was a key support for long-duration assets such as growth stocks.
While the midsummer market rally has been a welcome reprieve, we caution investors not to let their guards down. Bear market rallies (brief respites over the course of longer-term selloffs) aren’t exactly rare, and are usually seen during late cycle. The definition of a “bear market rally” is nebulous. It is usually used to refer to instances that meet the following criteria:
Follow a drawdown of at least 20% from the market’s previous all-time high.
A gain of 10% or more from the bear market’s prior low.
Be followed by another decline that represents a new low for the selloff (i.e., not be the first leg in the market’s recovery back to all-time highs).
According to those parameters, we found that five of the six major selloffs since the 1970s had at least one relief rally of more than 10% before dropping again to make fresh lows (2020’s lightning-quick selloff was the exception). The Global Financial Crisis and Tech Bubble each had three; the late ‘80s bear market – which was not accompanied by a recession – had one.While a “bear market rally” can only be defined in hindsight, we think that the next few months could remain choppy for equities. The recent rally was driven by a dovish shift of expectations on the Fed’s policy path from here, which could be immature given inflation is still too high relative to the central bank’s target and may remain elevated for longer due to
sticky wage inflation
. Markets are pricing in a best-case scenario: inflation coming down smoothly and quickly to the 2% target, growth weakening but only moderately, and expected earnings growth in equities that is still quite positive. We wrote in
a previous note
that negative revisions to earnings will likely pick up in the future months, and the magnitude of the cuts will be determined by the amount of demand curtailed by higher rates and inflation – which still seem to be highly uncertain at the moment. We’d note that estimate revisions are a necessary part of creating a durable bottom in equity markets. Recognition of these risks could be a key reason behind the rebound in the long-end yields over the past two weeks. This could continuously weigh on long-duration equities.As the S&P 500 is getting close to our year-end outlook range of 4,150 to 4,250, the risk/reward of equities may look less attractive. Given all the uncertainties mentioned above, we think it might be a good time to consider hedging your equity exposure to add protection to your portfolio while we await opportunities.
How to hedge?
For pure cash equity investors, making a switch from a high beta play (usually growth/tech stocks) into low beta play (usually value/high dividend stocks) is one of the simplest and easiest ways of minimizing losses in a market correction, as low beta plays tend to be more resilient. However, traditionally it is not considered a direct “hedge” against downside.
On the other hand, equity derivatives offer a 1-to-1, or even leveraged, hedging protection. Current timing is particularly interesting, as the 2-month rebound in the S&P 500 created hedging opportunities with the most attractive pricing in 14 years, according to a recent study by a Bank of America derivatives strategist. In general, a put option is usually more expensive than a call that is equally away from the current level. This reflects a higher demand for protection when the situation turns south. But factors ranging from rate hike expectation to investor sentiment and positioning have created an exceptional window from this historical pattern. We believe now is a good time to take advantage of this short window.
In terms of the horizon, structures with six month’s maturity seem to be the most interesting part of the S&P 500 volatility curve - to be long puts or put spreads, as those are the maturities that have been under the most pressure over the last month with volatility. From a catalyst perspective, there is not much on the calendar until September, so we think the Fall/Autumn period gets more interesting from a growth vs inflation trade off. Positioning remains supportive to the upside, but it does seem like the bulk of short covering has happened.
Given the market optimism (and hence more attractive hedging cost), structures with minimum redemption stand out (i.e. downside protection), and even downside participation makes a lot of sense.All market and economic data as of August 25, 2022 and sourced from Bloomberg Finance L.P. and FactSet unless otherwise stated.

After the 2018 midterms, I published the chart below since I thought it was notable that the GOP lost so many House seats at a time of robust economic and market conditions. Of course, House losses by the President’s Party do not always track these four quadrants that neatly. In 1922, many voters reacted negatively to Harding’s prohibition policies despite better than average market conditions. In 1942, voters reacted negatively to the early stages of FDR’s war effort, emerging scarcity of goods and frustrations around wage restrictions and price controls at a time of the largest House majority on record by either party (334 pre-midterm seats), despite improving economic conditions after the Depression. And in 1966, the Vietnam War and negative reactions to New Deal policies led to Democrats losing 47 seats despite better than average economic conditions at the time.
That said, here’s a preliminary read on the 2022 midterm elections based on the New York Times “needle” forecast of a net loss of 11 Democratic seats in the House, a figure which of course could change. If it holds, the President’s party will have done better than expected given below-average economic and market conditions. I will refrain from speculating on the reasons for this, but you all know what they might be. And to be clear, the NYT projection of seat changes would result in the GOP regaining control over the House by roughly the same small margin that Democrats had, which was the smallest governing margin in almost 100 years (see second chart, below). I consider the market consequences of the midterms to be negligible given the business cycle issues in play. The NYT needle forecast still shows the Senate as a toss-up, and any broader conclusions will have to wait until 5 races are resolved.Bubble chart plots midterm election losses for the President’s party since 1910. Bubble color indicates the President’s party (Democrat = blue; GOP = red) and bubble size indicates the number of House seats lost by that party in midterm elections. The bubbles are plotted into four-quadrants based on their trailing 2-year market conditions (x-axis: based on equities, home prices and government bonds) and economic conditions (y-axis: based on employment, wages and inflation), with the top right quadrant indicating above average market and economic conditions and the bottom left quadrant indicating below average market and economic conditions. The 2022 midterm election forecast appears in the bottom left quadrant; given such conditions, the forecasted loss of 11 Democratic seats in the House is better than expected.Bar chart displays the percent advantage of the House majority party (given by the % of majority party seats - % of minority party seats) since 1901 in descending order. Recent years tend to exhibit a narrower margin for House leadership. House Democrats during the FDR era (1937) had a 58% advantage over Republicans. In 2015, the margin of Republican control was 14%, while in 2021, the margin of Democratic control was just 2%.Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.

In the October Eye on the Market I wrote about how in 6 of 7 post-war recessions, equity markets preceded the decline in profits, employment and GDP by several months at least. I also mentioned that the best indicator to follow was the ISM survey, which tends to coincide with the equity market bottom +/- 2 months. So, in the interest of thinking about when equities could bottom, the first chart below projects the ISM survey by looking at new orders and inventories. Using this crude approach, the ISM would bottom in the mid-40’s in December. If so, 3570 on the S&P 500 Index reached in mid-October could actually mark the low for the cycle; such a scenario should not be discounted entirely, and would be consistent with market history.
Even so, I still think that there will be more corrections ahead, and that 3200-3300 would offer very good value for long term investors if we got there. The big question now is not how high inflation is going; it’s how long it will remain there. As shown in the second chart, the markets are pricing in a rapid descent in inflation, possibly due to expectations on China reopening or an end to the Russia-Ukraine war. But in the history of inflation spikes in developed countries, once inflation rises, it tends to stick around for a while. This would limit the opportunity for the Fed to rapidly reverse course and cut rates. More on all of this in our 2023 Outlook.

) supplies
As of September 2022, this is what was happening in Europe due to soaring energy costs and reliance on Russia:
70% of fertilizer capacity shuttered (BASF shuttered or slowed production at 180 of its plants worldwide)
30% decline in aluminum smelting capacity
ArcelorMittal to close two German electric arc furnace steel plants and others in Spain, Poland and France; Acerinox (Spain) furloughed 85% of its steel production workforce; other steel closures in Italy
Largest German cement company (Heidelberg) warned of plant closures if energy prices remain high
Since September 2021, 30 UK energy suppliers filed for bankruptcy; nationalization of French EDF
Lowest level of business expectations for energy intensive German industry since reunification in 1990
Germany sees highest inflation rate in 32 years (and in Italy, in 40 years)
European gas and electricity prices have declined sharply since the summer peak, and there are also a wide range of initiatives underway to cap energy prices, reduce energy taxes and provide support to businesses. As a result, some of this industrial production may come back online. However, European gas and electricity prices are still 2x-3x times higher than at the beginning of 2021, European gas prices are still 6x US levels, and few European countries will be able to immunize industry from the entire shock. While Europe is set for this winter with gas storage at 90%+ of capacity, one factor offsetting the loss of Russian pipeline gas (in addition to increased LNG imports) is lower European consumption due to higher energy prices. In other words, self-imposed austerity with all of its negative economic repercussions.
If I’ve learned anything from the 12 years working on our annual energy paper with Vaclav, it’s that the renewable transition will take time for all the technological, political, judicial, behavioral and economic reasons we discuss each year
. In the meantime, I’m thankful the US has ample supplies of its own natural gas. In the latest World Energy Outlook from the International Energy Agency, global natural gas demand
rises
by 2030 and 2050 in the Stated Policies scenario, and only declines by ~15% by 2050 assuming much more aggressive decarbonization policies.The US will need plenty of natural gas capacity even as more wind and solar power is built in response to energy bill incentives
. Wind and solar intermittency creates periods during the year when there’s not enough renewable generation to meet electricity demand. As a result, you typically cannot disconnect 1 MW of natural gas every time you add 1 MW of wind and solar power. The amount of natural gas that can be disconnected is referred to as a “capacity credit”; these credits are a function of specific hourly generation patterns in each region, and range from just 10% to 30% of added wind and solar power. More details in next year’s energy paper in a section on the irrelevance of “levelized costs”, which do not include backup power requirements.What about methane emissions and natural gas flaring?
If you accept EPA data at face value, methane “leakage” rates from natural gas have fallen to ~1%, down from 2.3% in 1990. These rates include leakage from exploration, production, gathering, processing, transmission, storage and distribution. However, EPA emissions data is usually provided by the oil & gas industry and may not reflect variations in utilization or operating performance. As a result, climate scientists conduct their own measurements. Based on aerial, satellite and other surveillance methods, some believe that the EPA data underestimates methane leakage rates by 60%.
In a December 2021 Dallas Fed survey, while 68% and 58% of large firms had plans to reduce methane emissions and flaring, only 24% and 26% of smaller firms had similar plans. The IEA believes that emission reductions of another 75% are feasible with proven technology. I asked my colleague Ben Ratner in J.P. Morgan’s Sustainability group for his thoughts on this issue, since he has done a lot of work on it. Ben’s comments:
Industry leaders have begun the important shift from desktop estimation to more accurate emission measurement (including the use of sensors on planes), committed to eliminate gas flaring by 2025 and engaged constructively with regulators
The federal government has directly regulated methane as a pollutant under the Clean Air Act for newer facilities, while also legislating a methane fee that is designed to give way to expanded regulations
States like Colorado, New Mexico, and Pennsylvania have instituted tight requirements for leak detection and repair, flaring minimization and other best practices
The Oil and Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) is a collaboration of US and European industry leaders working with civil representatives. Under OGMP’s recently defined “2.0” protocols, companies agree to set a methane target, increase methane measurement and report progress annually
Eliminating natural gas flaring is a common-sense move for companies that want to support energy security and sensibly reduce their carbon footprint. Note: in a 2019 Dallas Fed survey, 70% of respondents cited lack of pipeline capacity as the reason for Permian Basin flaring. Industry leaders do not put wells into production until pipeline capacity is available.
#2: The bipartisan realism of the semiconductor “CHIPs” bill, H.R. 4346
Let’s continue the energy thread from the prior section. For the renewable transition to accelerate, EV adoption will have to move into overdrive. Transportation accounted for one third of US fossil fuel consumption in 2021, around half of which was passenger cars and light trucks. There are critical mineral issues to be resolved regarding EVs; we will discuss those another time and talk about semiconductors today.
As shown below, EVs have more semiconductors than internal combustion engine cars
. The US will need a reliable supply of semiconductors if EVs come anywhere close to the forecasts released by the Senate in the aftermath of the energy bill. One of the sources the Senate cited estimates that 100% of US passenger car and light truck sales in 2030 will be EVs, and that 92% of Class 8 semi truck sales will be EVs as well in 2030.
Where would all the semiconductors come from?
Starting in 1990, semiconductor capacity started migrating out of the US. While the US still has 47% market share of global semiconductor
revenues
, only ~40% of US semiconductor
capacity
is located in the US; the rest is in Singapore, Taiwan, China, Japan and Europe. Taiwan has the largest share of global semiconductor capacity (20%), a 50% share of higher value added logic chip capacity and 60% of the semiconductor foundry market, which refers to outsourced semiconductor production for companies like AMD, Apple, Qualcomm and Nvidia. Do I need to spell out why this might be a geopolitical and economic risk for the US? Probably not.
So, that’s why I’m thankful for H.R. 4346, otherwise known as the semiconductor “CHIPs” bill.
It creates meaningful support for US semiconductor production at a time when many US semiconductor companies are negatively affected by White House policies limiting high-end US semiconductor exports to China (Nvidia, which sell 95% of high end AI chips in China, is one example). Some critics view the CHIPs bill as “corporate welfare”; perhaps, but if your goal is improved US semiconductor supply chains, some government support will be needed to offset the impact of US national security priorities limiting their profitable exports to China.To be clear, the semiconductor bill is just a start.
See
the next chart below; BCG estimates that the $52 billion in the CHIPs bill dedicated to semiconductor production capacity is only 10% of what would be needed for complete US semiconductor self-sufficiency. But something is better than nothing, and at least it will begin to move the needle in the other direction and reverse some of the outsourcing trends.Is the CHIPs bill really bipartisan? Yes.
We track the partisanship of major bills since 1913 when legislation was passed creating the Federal Reserve and the first Federal income tax. The partisanship of major bills began to soar in the late 1990’s, and since the year 2000 many bills have essentially been single-party legislation passed by the party controlling the White House and both chambers. The Trump Tax Cut Act was the most partisan bill in US history, surpassing the prior partisanship peak (2009 Recovery and Reinvestment Act) until it was surpassed by the partisanship of the 2021 American Rescue Plan and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, both of which were passed without a single GOP “yes” vote in the House or Senate.
So with that context, the CHIPs bill’s support from 17 GOP Senators, 24 GOP House members and Trump’s former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo can be seen as an outpouring of giddy bipartisanship
.
What about Chinese reliance on Taiwan
? China accounts for 60% of global semiconductor demand, but only 10% of that demand is met via Chinese production. The other 90% is met through imports and foreign firms producing chips in China. As of 2021, Taiwan accounted for a 70% share of Chinese chip consumption: TSMC produces 10% of China’s chips in its factories in Nanjing and Shanghai, and exports the remaining 60% from Taiwan.
There may be no example anywhere in the world of one country so reliant on another for a specific high-value import
. That 70% reliance figure dwarfs Europe’s prewar reliance on Russian energy (around 25% of total European energy consumption in 2021). Most Chinese foundries are working on 14-28 nanometer chips while the global leaders like TSMC are already producing at 5-7 nanometers.
More background
2
: the most advanced and most profitable chips of 10, 7, 5, and 3 nm are difficult and costly to fabricate and can only be made by machines designed and built by ASML (Netherlands) using a process called extreme ultraviolet photolithography (EUV). Because of their complexity, ASML only produces 45-55 such machines per year. Advanced chip foundries require a clean room that is 10,000x cleaner than a hospital surgical room. The chip etching process, parts of which are done in a pure nitrogen environment, can take weeks operating 24 hours a day and involve 700 separate steps, many of them repeated. Completing all necessary steps in the value chain may involve multiple air flights back and forth over thousands of miles to sites with specialized capabilities. These foundries require exotic chemicals, gasses, rare metals, materials and components from thousands of companies and dozens of countries.#3: The remarkable success of mRNA vaccines in reducing mortality risk for people interested in taking them
The latest COVID variants are showing signs of increased resistance to existing treatments
3
, the bivalent booster derived from the original variant and BA.5 only has 12%-15% uptake (the US ranks 73
rd
in the world on boosters per 100 residents), and vaccine-induced and infection-induced immunity is waning. And as we all know by now, current mRNA vaccines are not highly effective at preventing infection and transmission, only at preventing hospitalization and mortality. What the world needs: nasal vaccine delivery which might do a better job preventing transmission and infection, and pan-coronavirus vaccines that are not variant-specific.
That said, I’m still very thankful for US mRNA vaccines, including the mRNA-1273 versions I have been receiving.
They have saved a lot of lives in the US and elsewhere, and according to the Brown School of Public Health, they could have saved more lives if vaccination uptake were higher

. That is all. Happy Thanksgiving.1

the only sensible approach would be to use “all-cause mortality” statistics instead

MR. MICHAEL CEMBALEST: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Thanksgiving Eye on the Market. In the October note last month, I wrote about how, in almost every post-war recession except for one of them, equity markets preceded the decline in profits and employment and GDP and things like that by several months and said, let’s focus on the ISM survey instead, because when that bottoms, it tends of coincide much more closely to the bottom of the equity markets.
So, in terms of thinking about when that can happen, we have some approaches to try to figure out when the ISM survey is going, and they’re crude, but the fit’s actually not bad, and using this approach, the ISM would bottom in the mid- to low-40s sometime in January, February of next year.
If that were the case, it’s not impossible that the lows we hit in mid-October would be the lows for the cycle, and almost everybody I talk to discounts that scenario entirely, although, you know, it would be consistent with market history. I think that there are more corrections ahead, and that something closer to 3300 would be pretty good value for long-term investors if we got there.
The big question to me, now, obviously is not how high inflation goes. It’s probably cresting. The question is how long will it stick around, and we’ve got a chart in this month’s piece that looks at all the episodes of rising inflation in developed countries, and once inflation spikes, it tends to stick around for a while, which is in stark contrast to the much more rapid decline in inflation that markets are pricing in, in both the U.S. and Europe.
Now, I know we’ve got some exogenous issues now with COVID and China and the Russia-Ukraine War. Even so, what’s priced in about the inflation decline is much more rapid than what we’ve seen historically. Anyway, more on all of this in our outlook for next year.
The purpose of this year’s note is an eye on the market on the three things that I’m thankful for, and my list this year is CH4, HR4346, and mRNA1273. I will of course explain.
So, number one, why am I thankful for CH4? Well, I’m referring, of course, to natural gas. Natural gas composition is mostly CH4 with little bits of ethane and propane and butane mixed in. Let’s look at what was going on in Europe about a month ago. 70 percent of the fertilizer capacity was shut down. 30 percent of its aluminum was shut down. Steel plants were closing in Germany, Spain, Poland and France. One of the biggest companies in Spain furloughed 85 percent of its workforce and steel producers. The cement companies were shutting down. 30 UK energy suppliers filed for bankruptcy. The French utility EDF was nationalized. We saw the lowest level of business expectations for energy intensive German companies since re-unification in 1990, and Germany and Italy were seeing the highest inflation rates in 32 and 40 years, respectively. Now, gas and electricity prices have declined a bunch in, in Europe since the summer peak, and there’s a bunch of initiatives underway to cap energy prices, reduce energy taxes and provide support to businesses. Eventually, obviously, those are all borne my taxpayers. So, some of this industrial production might come back online, but European gas and electricity prices are still two to three times higher than at the beginning of 2021. Gas prices are still six times U.S. levels, et cetera, so while Europe is set for this winter with plenty of gas storage, most countries are either at or above 90 percent of capacity, a lot of what Europe has done to prepare for the winter is also lowering its consumption due to higher energy prices, and that obviously has a lot of negative repercussions.
So, stepping back for a moment, if I’ve learned anything from the 12 years I worked on our energy paper with Vaclav [phonetic], it’s that these renewable transitions are going to take time, for technological reasons, political reasons, judicial reasons, behavioral, economic. We go into detail every year in the energy paper. In the meantime, I’m very thankful the U.S. has ample supplies of its own natural gas, and the latest world energy outlook from the IEA, they show global natural gas demand rising by 2030 and 2050, in the scenario that is attached to policies that countries are currently pursuing, rather than declining. And we’ll go into more detail next year.
But, there’s something that all of your probably understand now about wind and solar power. We’re going to need plenty of natural gas power, gas capacity, even as we build more wind and solar power. Wind and solar are very intermittent and there’s times during the year where there’s not enough renewable generation to meet the load demand. This is all pretty simple. As a result, you can’t disconnect a megawatt of natural gas every time you add a megawatt of wind and solar power. The actual amount you can disconnect is referred to as a capacity credit, and they’re computed, and they’re pretty intensive calculations. We do them. You have to take the hourly generation by type and demand loads in each ISO, which is the independent system operator. Bottom line, every time you add one megawatt of wind and solar power, in the major ISOs in the United States, you can only disconnect around 10 to 30 percent of that in terms of the natural gas that you can unplug because you need that back-up thermal capacity. And the cost of that back-up power is not included in anybody’s estimates, or in most estimates I see of levelized cost of wind and solar, which is why I think that levelized cost concept is kind of irrelevant.
What’s more relevant to me on this natural gas question is methane emissions and flaring, and we have a little bit of a discussion in here, progress is being made slowly. Most largely firms have plans to reduce methane emissions and flaring, but only about a quarter of the smaller firms do, and this is from a Dallas Fed survey from last December and so the, look, the industry leaders have begun a very important shift from quarterly desktop estimations of methane leakage to more accurate measurements using sensors on planes and things like that. Most of them have committed to eliminate flaring by 2025. There are some new Clean Air Act regulations. A lot of the states have adopted new regulations. There’s a European and U.S. partnership called the Oil and Gas Methane partnership, so the industry leaders are generally moving in the right direction here and, and hopefully through, through both the combination of self-preservation and legislation, the smaller companies will follow.
Okay, what’s the second thing that I’m thankful for. I mentioned HR4346. That is the semi-conductor bill. The U.S. is going to need a lot of semi-conductors in the future, particularly if the renewable transition is going to pick up speed through adoption of electric vehicles. The semi-conductor intensity of electric vehicles is roughly double that of traditional, internal combustion engine cars.
So, unfortunately, as we all know, semi-conductor capacity started migrating out of the United States rapidly in 1990, fell in half by 2000, and then fall in half again by 2020, so only around something like 12 percent of U.S., the United States accounts for only around 12 percent of global semi-conductor capacity. The U.S. has a large market share of global semi-conductor revenues, but that’s because it relies heavily on Taiwan for production because Taiwan’s got 50 percent share of high value added chip capacity and 60 percent of the foundry market. I don’t think I need to spell out why this might be a geopolitical risk for the United States.
So, I’m thankful for this semi-conductor bill that was passed. It gives support for U.S. semi-conductor companies. I think it helps offset some of the negative consequences of the latest policies restricting their ability to sell chips and equipment to China. Nvidia, for example, stock has been in freefall. They, 95, they sell 95 percent of the high end chips in China. And this bill has gotten some criticism as corporate welfare, and I understand that, but if your goal is to improve U.S. semi-conductor supply chains, some kind of government support is going to be needed to offset some of the negative impact of some of these new national security rules.
Now, this semi-conductor bill is just a start. It’s probably only 10 to 20 percent of what the U.S. would need to become substantially semi-conductor self-sufficient, so it’s just a drop in the bucket, 50, 60 billion, but it gets the ball rolling, and believe it or not, it was a bipartisan effort. In the last few years, we’ve had a lot of bills that passed with zero support. This is the first time in American history bills passed Congress without a single vote from the opposing party in the House or the Senate. The 2021 American Rescue Plan, the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act are examples of that, and when the Trump Tax Cut Act was passed, it was the most partisan bill in U.S. history at the time.
So, the CHIPS Bill got 17 GOP Senator, 24 GOP House members, and Mike Pompeo also supported it, so in the context of the world we lived in, we currently live in, it is definitely a bipartisan bill.
Just a couple of quick comments, too, the United States relies on Taiwan, and China relies on Taiwan to an entirely different level. 70 percent, China only produced 10 percent of its own chips. The other 90 percent comes from imports or foreign firms producing chips in China. Of that 90 percent, 70 percent share is Taiwan. So, Taiwan produces 10 percent of China’s chips in Nanjing and Shanghai, and then exports the remaining 60 percent from Taiwan. I can’t find anywhere in the world an example of one country that’s so reliant on another one for a high value import. For context, Europe was, before the Ukraine war, 20 percent, or 25 percent reliant on Russian energy. So, think about that, 70 percent reliance on Taiwan for semi-conductors by China. That’s a huge number, and most of the Chinese foundries are working on 14 to 30 nanometer chips. The global leaders like TSMA in Taiwan are already producing at five to seven nanometers, so if the U.S. is reliant on Taiwan from a semi-conductor perspective, China’s reliance on them is much, much, much greater.
The last thing I am thankful for this year are mRNA vaccines. Now, the news is not all good. The latest COVID variants are showing increased signs of resistance to treatments. The new booster, which is derived from both the original variant and BA5 only has a 12 to 15 percent uptake in the U.S. The U.S. ranks somewhere around 73
rd
in the world on booster shots, and vaccines no longer do a great job against infection and transmission. However, they do a great job at preventing hospitalization and mortality, particularly for people like me, who are, you know, 60 years old. I just turned 60, which I’m still getting used to.
Now, what the world really needs is nasal vaccine delivery mechanisms, which might do a better job at preventing transmission and infection because instead of, I mean, I think the vaccines now do a good job at preventing the infection from getting into your lungs, but it doesn’t prevent you from getting into your respiratory system, and that’s what a nasal delivery might be able to do. We also need pan-coronavirus vaccines that are not so variant specific, right? In other words, not just tuned into the, into the three-dimensional topological shape of one variant or another.
That said, I’m very thankful for these mRNA vaccines, including the Moderna versions that I received. They have saved a lot of lives in the U.S. and elsewhere, and we have a chart in here showing how much more lives they could have saved if the vaccination uptake were higher. There’s some charts in here that support all of that, but I consider all of this to be pretty straightforward stuff.
Now, as you might imagine, my thanksgiving list of natural gas, the CHIPS Bill and vaccines is a Venn diagram that doesn’t overlap with a lot of Americans in the United States, which is why I’m still working alone from my hidden, unnamed bunker. Anyway, Happy Thanksgiving to all of you, and thank you for listening to the podcast. Bye.

The market welcomed the softer than expected inflation print out of the U.S. with a broad-based relief rally. The S&P 500 climbed two percent on Wednesday, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 rose 2.9% led by megacaps. Gold and the dollar weakened across the board on the positive risk sentiment, and USD-JPY went down from 135 and stabilized around the 133 level. The moves are in line with our view that the dollar may be close to peaking. Nonetheless, it will likely stay strong as the current cycle matures.
In contrast to the clearly risk-on moves in equities and FX, reaction in bond markets has been somewhat inconsistent. The two-year yield dropped sharply right after the CPI announcement but climbed back above 3.2% in Wednesday trading, while the 10-year barely moved. Forward market pricing of Fed hiking expectations is now showing a toss-up between a 50 and 75bps hike in September. This suggests a wide range of expectations among traders over how the Fed will react to the softer but still elevated CPI print. Today’s Strategy Question will break down the print and discuss our thoughts on how inflation might go from here.Strategy Question: Is Inflation Finally Peaking?
We are fond of saying that you have to get inflation right to invest successfully. It impacts monetary policy, bond yields, and asset price valuations – meaning it’s hard to get either equities or bond yields right if you get inflation wrong. Over the last year nearly everyone (including us) got it wrong, as inflation persistently surprised on the upside. However, yesterday’s U.S. inflation print might finally give some hope that inflation has peaked as pandemic and war distortions begin to fade. July core inflation (not including food or fuel) numbers surprised on the downside, rising 0.3% (month-on-month), below the consensus expectations of 0.5%, and its slowest pace since September 2021. Re-opening categories – which have been driving inflation in recent months – surprised on the downside with larger-than-expected declines in airfares, used cars, and hotel lodging. Bond and equity markets both rallied and expectations for September Fed rate hikes eased a bit (but are still higher than a couple of weeks ago).In the background a number of factors are moving in a disinflationary direction, with commodity prices lower and supply chains showing some meaningful signs of healing. These have all contributed to falling headline consumer prices and will likely continue to allow them to fall in coming months. Nonetheless, while pandemic and re-opening-related categories are finally easing, services and rents (which tend to be stickier) continued to rise at a very strong pace, reflecting tight labor markets. Capacity constraints in the service sector, driven in large part by the lack of labor, are also still very real.Our bottom line is: while we are happy to take all the good news we can get, the coast isn’t clear yet.
While moving in the right direction, inflation is still too high to be consistent with the Fed’s mandate, and it will take much more than one month of data to verify that inflation is sustainably falling. We expect the hiking cycle to continue through at least the rest of the year, even if the hikes are at a slower pace than the 75 basis point moves we saw in June and July. Meanwhile, economic output is weak, especially in the durable goods and housing sectors, and it will take time for the tightening that the Fed has already done to flow through to the economy.
In a services-led economy like the U.S., wages and the broad service sector are a key determinant to overall price pressures. Here, despite the softer U.S. economic data that we have seen over the last month, recent data shows an overheated labor market. The non-farm payrolls report released last Friday showed that the economy added 528 thousand jobs in July, which is more than double the expected 250 thousand that economists had anticipated. At the same time, the unemployment rate slipped to 3.5%, from 3.6%. This marked a milestone – as the U.S. economy has now recouped the 22 million jobs lost in the initial months of the pandemic, and the unemployment rate returned to its February 2020 low. While tighter financial conditions will likely cool the labor market and some indicators are already showing a slowdown (i.e. rising initial jobless claims, falling job openings in the JOLTS report, etc.), as former New York Fed chair Bill Dudley said, the U.S. labor market is still “unprecedentedly tight’. In addition, the pandemic distortions across different sectors explain why we could still see significant tightness in services sectors for some time.As a result, wage inflation proves itself to be one of the stickiest components in the inflation conversation. Complicating the conversation, there are different measures giving differing views of the problem. The below chart shows the wage growth overshoot from three different measures: Total Employment Average Hourly Earnings (AHE), Production & Nonsupervisory AHE, and the Employment Cost Index (ECI). Year-over-year growth is a bit misleading right now since it hides the near-term dynamics. Thus, we look at six month annualized percentage changes for the AHE measures and QoQ annualized percentage changes for the ECI measure. Ignoring the noise in the early stages of the pandemic, the overshoot was apparent and has been the primary reason for the Fed to keep hiking rates and go beyond neutral. However, you can also see the deceleration in wage growth, year to date, in the chart. Underlying wage growth is probably somewhere between the two AHE measures, which means it is in the vicinity of 4.55% and 5.25%. This would be consistent with underlying price inflation in the economy somewhere between 3-4%. This is still uncomfortably high and clearly higher than the 3.75% rate that is consistent with the Fed's 2% inflation target over the medium term.
Today, the bigger macro question and uncertainty is whether inflation will remain static in the 3-4% range, or will wages decelerate enough to bring underlying inflation back to 2% without significantly higher rates (more than what’s in the price)? The question is important – if inflation remains sticky, policy rates might need to go to 4-5% to tame inflation. On the other hand, if wages continue to decelerate, the Fed only hiking to the 3-4% policy rate (which is what the market currently prices) could be enough to bring core inflation back to target. Given the uncertainty around inflation, we don't know for sure if the current market pricing on the Fed will be enough to bring inflation back to trend, but this is where the main debate is currently situated.What are the investment implications?
With more signs that inflation is peaking it’s important to lay out the potential paths from here. On one hand, inflation could continue to decelerate as wage pressure moderate and other pandemic or war distorted markets gradually normalize. This will likely allow inflation to fall smoothly back to the Fed’s 2% target without any more hikes than what’s already in the price. On the other hand, inflation could remain relatively sticky at higher levels. Although peaked, underlying labor tightness and services inflation could force inflation to settle at a run rate of 3-4% forcing the Fed to have to hike further than what’s already discounted. In some respects we see equity markets already priced for the former having rallied on the narrative that peak inflation and peak Fed hawkishness is behind us. We’re more cautious and think the risk reward is still attractive in fixed income, particularly shorter-dated investment grade bonds. If the second scenario plays out, which is a very real risk given the underlying core services inflation, rate expectations will likely have to adjust upwards and growth downwards. With inflation and recession risks still elevated and yields attractive we continue to focus on credit over equities.All market and economic data as of August 11, 2022 and sourced from Bloomberg Finance L.P. and FactSet unless otherwise stated.

Patricia Behling, Equity Strategist
Global leaders’ message at the 26th U.N. Climate Change Conference of the Parties in Glasgow last November was clear: We need to act now—and quickly—to avoid future climate-change disasters.
Will we? That’s the question U.S. President Joe Biden put to fellow leaders at the conference, asking: “Will we seize the enormous opportunity before us? Or will we condemn future generations to suffer?”
In the run up to the conference, some serious pledges were made. The U.S., EU and Japan are now committed to reach net zero by 2050. China is aiming to get there by 2060.
The conference did make significant progress.  The final agreement set out a vision for a world that radically cuts back coal usage, eliminates fossil-fuel subsidies and commits governments to the most ambitious targets of the Paris Agreement. In short, it creates an even stronger tailwind behind the clean energy transition.
Meanwhile, companies around the world are responding with their own emission targets. More than 65% of companies in the S&P 500
i
, making up more than 80% of market capitalization, have announced an emissions target.
1
But to actually meet promised targets, the world must fundamentally change how humanity consumes energy. Here, we take a quick look at where the world is now in its transition to clean energy. We also focus on two key areas that are likely to provide investors with real opportunities: semiconductors and green buildings.
2
Update: Where we are now in the transition to clean energy
The scientific consensus is that—to keep global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels—the world should reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. To do that, almost 90% of global electricity generation in 2050 must come from renewable sources. Staying on track for this goal means that, in the next eight years alone, wind and solar capacity will have to increase fourfold, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).
3Economics now support a rapid transition. The cost of wind and solar technologies has fallen rapidly, making them now the cheapest sources of incremental additions to electricity generation (even without subsidies).
4
Meanwhile, many governments are pushing for faster adoption of renewable energy generation and are committing significant amounts of investments to finance this transition. It seems to be working. In 2021, renewables accounted for 70% of the total $530 billion spent on global new power generation capacity.
5Still, more will be needed soon. If we want to keep 1.5°C within reach, the IEA estimates, global annual investments in clean energy projects and infrastructure must reach nearly $4 trillion by 2030.
6
Clearly, such a financial commitment should increase market opportunities for the companies involved in this transition. Indeed by most estimates the global investible market in renewable energy is likely to grow at an annual pace of at least 8% throughout this decade.
7
Two key areas in the clean energy ecosystem we find particularly interesting are semiconductors and green buildings.
8
Semiconductors—look at the big picture
Semiconductors have been in the news a lot, as shortages have been causing production delays and countries around the world have been vowing to on-shore. These issues are significant.
But the role that semiconductors will play in any successful energy transition is under appreciated by investors. Three examples show how intertwined semiconductors are with our technological future and the energy requirement that future will demand:
Perhaps the biggest area, and interdependence, is in the field of artificial intelligence (A.I.). Semiconductors are essential for interpreting data to train A.I. systems, and then guide A.I. decisions by generating inferences about the future. Training a single A.I. model can cause carbon emissions equivalent to the lifetime emissions of five cars.
9
Without significant innovation, A.I. will require a dramatic rise in energy requirements. Indeed, some estimates see the 2025 power requirements for A.I. training and inference as exceeding more than 10% of global electricity supply (which is roughly Europe’s entire, current electricity usage).
Only 30.4% of primary energy is truly usable after losses from both transformation and conversion.
10
Semiconductor’s power efficiency will matter greatly, given they are set to be the key element for the majority of electronic systems, serving communications, signal processing, computing and control applications in both the consumer and industrial markets for the foreseeable future.
Without innovations to semi-conductors, the primary energy requirements for the world’s growing population will spiral beyond the planet’s capacity.
The need for semiconductors will rise exponentially as smart and electric vehicles (EVs) gain an ever-greater share of the global vehicle fleet.  Already today, electronics account for 40% of the total cost of a car, up from 18% in 2000. This is just the beginning.
As autonomous driving features become more prevalent, the demand for semiconductors will need to increase to power all the necessary cameras, radar sensors, light detection and ranging (LIDAR) units and computer systems. Observers expect a three-fold increase in semiconductor sales revenues for the automotive industry between 2020 and 2025 alone.
11
Even if the transition to EVs from ICE vehicles is slower (as our firm has suggested may be the case
12
), the demand for semiconductors from automobiles is likely to continue increasing in the coming years.
Despite the dependency on semiconductors to scale up sustainability infrastructure, the semiconductor sector does face some risks as geopolitical tensions and new legislations affect different companies to varying degrees. For investors, active management in this sector is crucial.
Green buildings
Buildings account for a staggering 38% of global carbon dioxide gas emissions (counting building construction and operation). Indeed, in most major metropolises today, buildings are the largest single source of emissions.
13
Clearly, it will be difficult to meet the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement without almost all major buildings on earth being net zero by 2050.
14
Shifting to green buildings is already top of mind for the real estate sector, thanks to growing environmental pressures from the public and policymakers. And there are many ways commercial and residential buildings can achieve greater energy efficiency; for example:
Using more sustainable construction materials that are designed to be more energy-, water- and resource-efficient
Installing efficient HVAC systems, higher-grade insulation, and energy-efficient lighting
Incorporating smart devices and digital infrastructure to gain access to vast sums of data that could improve building efficiency (particularly for commercial buildings)
A major shift to green buildings could take place over the coming years, creating opportunities for investors. Real estate companies already are finding that the increased upfront costs of more sustainable construction methods and materials can lead to significant reductions in operational costs.
15
It is estimated that by 2028, there could be more than four billion smart devices in commercial buildings worldwide.
16
Real estate companies are expected to leverage data from smart devices to help improve the efficiency of existing buildings and improve construction for future buildings.
Policymakers also are paying close attention. The G7 countries have allocated over $267 billion in post-COVID stimulus towards a greener and more equitable recovery , which includes more than $51 billion in stimulus specifically targeted towards “greening” buildings.
17
For investors, these trends mean…
Remaking and saving the world is an exciting, even noble venture. Investing wisely in energy’s “Great Transition” requires a careful look at renewables, e-mobility, greener buildings and other enabling technologies. It also means finding those companies and funds that have exposure to these trends and are best placed to benefit from the tailwind of technological change, growing policy support and shifting social attitudes.

Nextera (2019); EIA (2019). However, it is important to remember that the real world cost of adding renewables will rise as they represent a larger share of energy generation. Renewables also have built-in added costs as their intermittent generation of energy needs to offset by either: massive battery storage capacity, excess renewable capacity to ensure batteries are keep charged, or redundant base load capacity (as back up when renewable generation slows).

Should they be in your portfolio?published Date:- Nov 15, 2022Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.
Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.With tax-equivalent yields around 7% and strong fundamentals, municipal bonds are one of our highest-conviction ideas.Paul Jacobson, Municipal Credit Analyst
Chris Seter, Fixed Income Strategist
This material is intended for U.S. investors only.
If you own municipal bonds, you’re likely well aware that they’ve had a tough year, as the Federal Reserve has hiked interest rates sharply. Rising interest rates negatively impact the price of bonds, including muni bonds; this prompts many investors to sell, which puts further pressure on bond prices.
But now it gets interesting. As prices declined, yields on muni bonds rose to their highest levels in more than a decade. They’re currently higher than most other bond yields and close to annualized long-term equity returns.
What’s more, while bonds with higher yields typically require investors to accept a higher risk of default, most municipalities currently have extremely strong financial positions, which should translate to a relatively lower risk.
That adds up to a compelling risk/return opportunity in municipal bonds. Let’s take a closer look.
High yields for a high-quality asset class
The Bloomberg Municipal Bond Index declined 12.5% this year through November 7—one of the worst-performing years in history. But its yield has risen from 1% to almost 4%.
More importantly, the tax-equivalent yield (the higher yield that a taxable bond would need to equal that of a tax-exempt muni bond) has risen to 7%—the highest level in over a decade.
This means muni bonds are outperforming the 4% yield for Treasuries and 6% yield for the JULI Investment Grade Corporate Index. They are even topping the close to 6.5% annualized return for the S&P 500 Index since 2000.
Muni bonds also look attractive compared to Treasuries when expressed as a yield ratio using same-maturity Treasuries.Muni fundamentals are the strongest in decades
To get high yields, you typically have to take more risk. For example, the only major U.S. fixed income asset class yielding more than muni bonds is high yield, where issuers are rated below investment grade because they have a higher risk of default.
But here’s the good news: Muni bonds not only offer high yields now, they also are a higher-quality asset class. Roughly 85% of the market is rated A or higher.
And current fundamentals are in particularly good shape. Boosted from federal fiscal and monetary policy support during the pandemic, municipal revenues have surprised to the upside in the past two years.
One result is that many state and local jurisdictions have been able to bolster their “rainy day” funds, provide tax relief, pay down debt or make supplemental pension payments.
In 2022, the public finance system continues to be awash in liquidity, benefiting from federal government–funded relief, including the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act and the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), among others.
At the same time, home prices and wages have continued to rise, lifting municipalities’ revenues from property taxes and wages. Tax receipts are up 18.2% this year, on average, in the 40 states that provided tax data through July.
This exceptionally strong financial position means that most muni bond issuers are unlikely to default on their payments, even if the economy goes into a recession and causes municipal revenues to decline.How might municipal bonds fit in your portfolio?
While rate volatility could remain elevated in the short term, muni bond’s higher yield now provides an enhanced buffer against further price declines should interest rates continue to rise.
Muni bonds also might be helpful in a portfolio in the opposite scenario: If the economy goes into recession and interest rates decline, muni bond prices would appreciate (essentially the opposite of what has been happening)—which could boost total muni bond returns at a time when equity returns may be lower.
We believe muni bonds now offer outstanding value for investors seeking to extend duration in fixed income portfolios and to lock in elevated yields for a multi-year period. Investors have options for implementation.
In a bond ladder, a Separately Managed Account is used to purchase a portfolio of bonds with different maturities. Ladders typically include high grade issues with credit ratings of A or AA and exposure to core sectors (such as General Obligation bonds and/or large revenue bond issuers).
Investors looking to get into fixed income more broadly could also benefit from active solutions that have a meaningful allocation to muni bonds, along with the flexibility to invest in other areas of fixed income during times of market dislocation.
Lastly, those who want to focus on adding duration to their portfolios could consider longer-dated muni bonds with eight-to-10-year calls to gain duration exposure and lock in yields over the long term.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.We are on a highway to climate hell with our foot on the accelerator.A mission 30 years in the making has been accomplished.“The choice is between adapting or starving.”At COP27, from 6 - 18 November 2022, more than 35,000 delegates came together in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, to take collective action against climate change. Set against the challenging geopolitical background, delegates had to balance the demands of the energy transition, energy independence and cost of living. Overall the sentiment was that the progress to “phase down” fossil fuels has been insufficient to limit global temperature rise to 1.5⁰C. Nonetheless, having been dubbed the “implementation COP”, the focus was on how to finance, implement and achieve countries commitments.
Our three main takeaways are:
Commitments remain well-off track to achieving 1.5°C but key emitting countries updated their pledges.
Real progress on funding a “just energy transition” was made, including a breakthrough agreement on a new “Loss and Damage” fund for vulnerable countries.
Progress on climate adaptation was made, with governments agreeing to advance the Global Goal of Adaptation.
See what this means for you as a potential investor.
1. Commitments remain well-off track to achieving 1.5
°
C but key emitting countries updated their pledges.Last year at COP26 in Glasgow, countries agreed to focus on limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Their commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions were too weak to achieve this but they agreed to return this year to strengthen them. While 24 countries did, 170 did not
1
. Policies currently in place point to a 2.8°C temperature rise by the end of the century, with implementation of current pledges only reducing this to a 2.4°C – 2.6°C temperature rise.
2
On the bright side, in the run up and during COP27 we saw key emitting countries update their commitments:
Indonesia (1.5% of global carbon emissions
3
), top coal exporter in the world, brought forward its net zero emissions target to 2060.
Brazil’s (1.3% of global carbon emissions
3
) President-elect Lula da Silva pledged to reverse Bolsonaro’s plans to increase its greenhouse gas emissions.
Australia (1.2% of global carbon emissions
3
) passed a Climate Change Bill to deliver a 43% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 levels by 2030, and net zero by 2050.
Whilst the United States (14.02% of global carbon emissions
3
) did not increase its commitment, it signed the Inflation Reduction Act to reduce carbon emissions by 40% compared to 2005 levels by 2030.
Investment thought:
Despite the challenged macro environment, countries maintained their ambitions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The disappointing decision not to broadly raise targets highlights the fact that the world continues to rely on fossil fuels for 83% of energy consumption and even the most ambitious transition plans will still require hydrocarbon use over the short term.
4
We therefore expect to see a simultaneous boom in both traditional and clean energy over the coming years.
2. Real progress on funding a “just energy transition” was made, including a breakthrough agreement on a new “Loss and Damage” fund for vulnerable countries.The US, Europe, and China are responsible for just over 50% of all historical greenhouse gas emissions since 1850.
5
Yet, the most severe impacts of climate change are disproportionately felt by poorer nations. Pakistan contributes less than 1% of the global greenhouse gas emissions but faces estimated costs greater than US $30 billion in damages from to repair this year’s flooding.
6COP27 seized the opportunity to advance environmental justice and change the rhetoric of the debate to
“who must pay, for what”
.
Sunday morning, after two weeks of negotiations and previous decades of debates, governments agreed to establish a new dedicated fund to assist developing countries in responding to loss and damage. To put simply, compensation or reparations for climate related damages caused by extreme weather events. The materiality of the fund remains in progress, no sums of money were committed, and decisions on how the fund will work have been left to next year’s COP28.
A new Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) funding deal was also announced, where the US and other developed countries will work with Indonesia to mobilise USD $20 billion over the next 3 to 5 years to accelerate the transition from coal toward a cleaner energy future. The partnership model was based on South Africa’s USD $8.5 billion JETP which was first announced at COP26 and further developed into a five-year investment plan this year.
7
Investment thought:
Agreement for a ""Loss and Damage"" Fund and new JETP partnerships mark significant positive developments for environmental justice. While the terms of ""Loss and Damage"" are yet to be decided, the JETP partnerships will be mobilised through public and private partnership and the IEA has stated that it will act as a positive tailwind to scale up renewable power, such as solar, wind, hydro, geothermal and bioenergy.
8
3. Progress on climate adaptation was made, with governments agreeing to advance the Global Goal of Adaptation.2022 has been another year on record for extreme weather events: deadly heatwaves occurred in India and Pakistan, temperatures reached 40°C above normal in parts of Antarctica

, and severe flooding impacted South Africa, Brazil, Bangladesh and Pakistan.
As the number of people impacted by climate change increases, countries are being forced to prioritise investing in adaptation. The Standing Committee on Finance (SCF) report highlights that while mitigation constitutes the largest share of climate specific financial support, the share of adaptation finance continues to increase and grew at the fastest rate.
10The Global Goal of Adaptation was established under the Paris Agreement with the aim to build adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability. COP27 saw positive progress towards the goal - new pledges totalling more than USD $230 million were made to the Adaptation Fund, the Sharm el-Sheikh Adaptation Agenda to enhance resilience of vulnerable populations was launched, and the SCF was requested to report on doubling adaptation finance for consideration at COP28 next year.
11
One area of particular focus was Food Security. While food systems account for a third of greenhouse gas emissions, they only account for 3% of climate finance.
12
Recognising the importance of this, a whole day was dedicated to “Adaptation and Agriculture”. 13 countries have now endorsed the Agriculture Breakthrough which aims to make climate-resilient, sustainable agriculture the most widely adopted option by 2030. Additionally, a USD $8 billion R&D fund, led by the US and the UAE, was announced to reduce the environmental impact of farming.
13
Investment thought:
Earlier this year when launching the IPCC 2022 report, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said “as climate impacts worsen – and they will – scaling up investments will be essential for survival. Adaptation and mitigation must be pursued with equal force and urgency.” COP27 showed the increased attention countries are now paying to adaptation. Going forward we anticipate seeing increased investments in enhancing water efficiencies, adapting the built environment, and reinventing food and agriculture. In particular, we expect innovations in alternative food supplies, vertical farming and micro irrigation to create robust opportunities for investors.
Piecing it all together
While progress to limit global temperature rise to 1.5⁰C was weaker than anticipated, there is hope that COP27 provided the first of many. The first COP to be hosted in Africa, agree on a new ""Loss and Damage"" fund and dedicate a day to “Adaptation and Agriculture”. We believe that this urgency for action and momentum to transition provides investors with secular growing opportunities to mitigate and adapt to climate change, as well as the need to account for climate-related risks.
Private sector investments are vital to achieving countries’ transition ambitions and the financial services sector plays an important role in firstly managing the sector’s current impact on emissions and secondly exploring how the sector can fund the transition to Net Zero. The commitment to these objectives will support financial flows into Sustainable Investment Assets, as evidenced by a Morningstar report released during COP27, the number of climate-themed funds continues to grow as investors seek more options to leverage opportunities.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.As market volatility pushes down valuations, now may be the time to think about investingFew investors will look back on 2022 with affection. Russia invaded Ukraine, stock markets turned volatile, global supply chains broke and inflation soared. In an attempt to restore price stability, the U.S. Federal Reserve (the Fed) raised rates faster than it has since the 1980s.
In 2023, inflation may be starting to cool, but interest rates remain elevated, sparking liquidity problems in the banking industry. The risk of a recession still hangs in the air. These challenges are real, but we see fresh opportunities arising in private markets this year as volatility continues and valuations get more attractive. And for funds launching right now, we see the potential to realize strong relative returns over time.
History supports our view. Managers capable of providing capital when it is more costly and difficult for companies to obtain it have an opportunity to acquire assets at attractive prices and secure better deal terms. This dynamic has played out over several market cycles—managers that launch funds in periods of economic stress and market volatility tend to outperform.
1
Even if the Fed does manage to engineer a soft landing for the U.S. economy in 2023, this year may prove a good year for many private markets. So if you want to access emerging opportunities in alternatives, now may be an ideal moment to do so.
Adding private markets to a portfolio
In the words of American polymath and founding father Benjamin Franklin, “out of adversity comes opportunity.” While it may be tempting to de-risk this year by holding more cash, opportunities will likely still emerge from ongoing market volatility. But where are they going to come from? And how can you think about adding them to your investment portfolio?
If you’re just starting to invest in private markets, it’s important to take a balanced and diversified approach—which includes diversifying by investment year, as well as strategy and asset class. Like fine wine, private investments are often referred to by their vintage years, which indicates the first year a fund starts investing in its three- to five-year lifecycle. Diversifying by vintage years can help achieve smoother, less volatile returns over time.
It’s equally important to diversify by manager, investment strategy, geography and asset type—just as you would in a portfolio of listed stocks and bonds.
If you already have an existing portfolio of alternative investments, you may want to consider adding targeted investment exposures based on your current holdings and long-term investment objectives.
Entry points emerge across strategies and assets
Whether you’re new to private markets or an experienced investor, we believe market conditions in 2023 will likely provide compelling entry points as the year progresses. Here are the key areas where we see the greatest potential for future outperformance:
Core private equity
:
Public market volatility creates opportunity
We believe this is an opportune time to allocate to core private equity based on signs of a gradual slowdown in the U.S. economy. Asset valuations typically lag public markets, which means that prices for large, industry-leading private companies are becoming more reasonable for managers aiming to put money to work.
Managers also stand to benefit from the recent collapse in the total volume of initial public offerings (IPOs) globally.
2
Companies that are unable to access the IPO market for financing may be forced to stay private for longer—and for private equity managers with ample funding to offer, this is good news. As a result, many expect to see increased deal flow this year.
Looking ahead, managers with good track records in periods of slow-to-no growth may be well positioned to prosper in a challenging economy. Private equity managers that engage with their portfolio companies as owner-operators, optimizing costs and applying capital market knowledge, are much more likely to outperform their peers by a wide margin.
3
Secondaries: High-quality institutional funds come to market
We see opportunities in the private equity secondaries market as many institutional investors—forced to rebalance their portfolios to meet target allocations—look to sell off a portion of their current private equity holdings. This dynamic, which arises when lower public equity prices leave institutions overweight private equity, often means discounted offerings for slices of high-quality existing funds.
Investing in secondaries can offer some distinct advantages: Investors can benefit by gaining access to a portfolio of mature funds that offers broad diversification and is closer to returning capital. Secondaries also can provide good visibility into a fund’s underlying portfolio of assets. As with all private market opportunities, but specifically with secondaries, selecting an experienced manager with a strong network of institutional contacts and a proven track record of identifying high-quality assets with significant upside potential is essential.
Growth equity and venture capital: Young companies seek more support
Growth equity—which primarily invests in mid- to late-stage tech companies—offers access to industry sectors that can be hard to reach via public markets, such as artificial intelligence (AI), climate technology and cybersecurity. Like all tech investments, however, growth equity is subject to market volatility—and 2022 was no exception.
Last year, growth equity suffered the steepest decline in asset prices of any industry sector. We anticipate valuations will erode as capital remains scarce—and many companies will likely need it this year.
Growth equity and venture capital managers are ready to provide that needed capital. If you are interested in accessing innovation and growth, remember this: There’s a wide gulf between top- and bottom-performing managers in the growth equity and venture space. We believe managers with deep industry knowledge and networks, and experience investing through challenging periods for growth investing will be more likely to outperform.
Infrastructure: Global shifts create entry points
Across global infrastructure markets, structural changes are redrawing the competitive landscape as the world seeks to accelerate digital enablement, reduce dependence on fossil fuels and deglobalize supply chains. As these transitions progress, the need for new, non-traditional digital, environmental or industrial infrastructure will likely increase. At the same time, many traditional infrastructure assets—such as utility or power companies—still need to source additional financing, too.
We see a massive gap between infrastructure investment and the demand for fresh capital, estimated to be nearly US$3.6 trillion.
4
This shortfall creates an opportunity for seasoned managers with specialized operating knowledge. For investors new to this asset class, it’s essential to work with experienced managers that can navigate the complexities of infrastructure types and ensure adequate diversification.
Private credit
:
Providers gain
more
pricing power
As the two traditional sources of credit financing are less available—public markets and banks—more companies are turning to private credit. Greater uncertainty and lower bond issuance in public markets have already begun to increase demand for private capital alternatives. High yield bond issuance, for example, dropped by 78% year-over-year between 2021 and 2022; leveraged loan issuance fell by 70% during the same period.
5
Meanwhile, banks are experiencing liquidity issues not seen since the 2008 Financial Crisis.
In periods of economic and market stress, private credit managers with capital to deploy can demand more favorable terms (including higher premiums) on the loans they provide. Those with underwriting and public market knowledge are poised to take action, especially in the event of a sell-off in high yield bonds and leveraged loans.
Even if rates remain unchanged, we expect more distressed credit or “special situation” opportunities to emerge. These shifts may help differentiate performance for credit funds launching in 2023.
We can help
As always—but especially in alternatives—due diligence and selectivity are essential, as performance can vary widely.

https://privatebank.jpmorgan.com/gl/en/insights/investing/key-investment-themes,"Investment StrategyInvestment themes and megatrends driving future growthpublished Date:- Oct 1, 2022Recession risks are elevated. And if the Fed continues on its current trajectory, we think it’s more likely than not that we will see one in the second half of next year. For investors, elevated recession risks should not result in a binary choice between “getting in” and “getting out.” Instead, we are focused on options that provide protection against a potential recession.Investing through the cycle also means investing for the next cycle. As asset valuations fall, they become more attractive to long-term investors. Further, long-term trends like energy transitions, digital transformation, and healthcare innovation are areas for consideration. The next cycle will likely feature reconceived and restructured global supply chains, alongside meaningful developments in the energy transition and real estate sector. Meanwhile, opportunities are emerging in US mid cap equities.Central bank tightening cycles are causing reduced capital market activity and elevated volatility. Investors can use both dynamics to their advantage.Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.
Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Our outlook for the remainder of the year is still constructive, but there are many potential challenges ahead, especially the most aggressive Fed tightening cycle in decades. To help investors navigate this ever-changing landscape, we share our latest updates of the three key investment themes that are guiding investment decisions.Add portfolio buffers
Core fixed income and macro hedge funds can help provide protection while recession risks are elevated.Focus on quality
When economic and earnings growth slows, and margins come under pressure, quality and defensive equities have historically performed better than other equities. Systematic hedging strategies can also provide additional protection.Please reach out to discuss these topics in further detail. We stand with you, ready to help, offer advice and share our best thinking.Find value in equities
Valuations for both mid and small cap equities could provide an attractive long-term entry point. The illiquidity premium in private equity investments could be particularly attractive in an environment where capital is scarce.Position for structural change in real assets & energy transitions
Structural underinvestment in real estate, infrastructure, and traditional energy could create a long-term opportunity for investors who are seeking current income and inflation protection while clean energy transitions can offer structural growth potential.Capitalize on digital transformation & healthcare innovation
After a turbulent bear market, many secular growth companies in the technology and healthcare sectors are trading at more reasonable valuations.Please reach out to discuss these topics in further detail. We stand with you, ready to help, offer advice and share our best thinking.Take advantage of capital scarcity
Reduced capital market activity creates a financing gap that investors can take advantage of. Private credit, structured equity, and preferred equities can offer equity-like returns with the additional protection that comes with a more senior position on the capital structure.Monetize volatility
Investors can use structured notes, options, and managed strategies to design more certain return profiles, to hedge existing exposures, or to generate excess income across asset classes.Please reach out to discuss these topics in further detail.

Non-Fungible Trainwreck
. First, I’m pleased to offer readers of the Eye on the Market a holiday gift that I commissioned for you: a one-of-a-kind “APE Innovation ETF” non-fungible token. Just copy and paste the image below and your digital journey will begin. Maybe hang it in the digital living space that you bought this year

.Like 2002, 2022 was also a year when unprofitable companies got repriced. The 2019-2022 cycle was arguably “dumber” since there was a historical precedent for this kind of thing. The second and third charts you will have seen before in this piece (I started writing about the YUCs in our 2020 Outlook), and are part of how we monitor the price for equity risk. Around 60%-70% of the YUC/MUC surge has now been reversed.During the stimulus bonanza, digital assets were priced at an unrealistic premium relative to physical ones. Monetary and fiscal policy are normalizing now after the longest period of negative real interest rates since 1820 and the largest fiscal deficits since 1800 (other than during WWI and WWII), so I’m not surprised to see a basket of farm equipment, office cleaning supplies and industrial REITs finally outperforming “innovation” stocks. I’m also not surprised to see oil, gas and pipeline companies outperforming renewable energy companies again this year given all the issues we discuss in our energy paper. The real world is a tough and unforgiving place, and my job is to help investors navigate that.On energy, many investors and politicians underestimated the importance of Russia; after all how much damage could a country do if their share of world GDP was just 3%, its lowest in 200 years? This miscalculation was part of a broader underappreciation for thermal energy and ammonia/fertilizer at a time when the world was more focused on wind and solar power instead. That’s changing now; Germany just completed the first of five floating LNG regasification units, France plans for a substantial nuclear renaissance and China is importing record amounts of Russian gas and coal as part of a broader geopolitical realignment, one example of which is illustrated below. And while Russia is ruthlessly laying waste to Ukraine’s power grid, don’t be surprised if there is a ceasefire at some point, partially driven by the need for Europe to regain access to some Russian energy (oil and natural gas via land-based pipelines given damage to Nord Stream).To wrap up 2022, I have created three rules for investors to follow.
#1: The Gensler Rule: Don’t be a complete hypocrite
Existing rules give the SEC jurisdiction over onshore and offshore crypto intermediary platforms (exchanges and broker-dealers) to prevent fraud, manipulation, front-running, wash sales and other misconduct. However, this also usually requires an SEC determination that the intermediary is trafficking in “securities”, a loaded phrase in crypto. In doing so, the SEC is acting pursuant to a decades-old Howey test definition of a security (which has been upheld by Federal Courts so far, most recently in SEC vs LBRY), and almost always over the objections of the crypto industry, politicians in both parties, influential venture capital firms and people within the SEC itself (including SEC Commissioner Peirce, known as “Crypto-Mom” based on her support for the industry).
As a result, the Gensler Rule works as follows:
you may only criticize Commissioner Gensler and the rest of the SEC for the FTX failure if you meet all of the following criteria. No exceptions.
(a) you have stated that many cryptocurrencies (although not Bitcoin) qualify as securities and not commodities, and that the SEC should make this judgment based on the existing test unless Congress legislates a new one
(b) you have stated that the SEC should have responsibility for regulating onshore and offshore crypto exchanges dealing with US customers when “securities” are involved. SEC and CFTC jurisdiction over offshore platforms requires a nexus with US individuals. This is often not difficult to establish: it’s an open secret that US crypto investors frequently evade jurisdictional requirements; roughly 60% of all US crypto derivative trades were reportedly executed at the offshore unit of FTX.com
2
(c) you support the many speeches by Gensler and SEC predecessor Clayton on crypto risks, and support the SEC’s 100+ crypto enforcement actions to-date (Grayscale, Telegram, Kik, BlockFi, BitTorrent, Coinbase, LBRY etc), and support Clayton’s 2018 stinging rebuke to a group of attorneys who worked on initial coin offerings
(d) you are not one of the Senators or Representatives that receive campaign contributions from Coinbase, Digital Currency Group, Ripple, Andreesen Horowitz, Blockchain Capital and other firms that generally argue against SEC jurisdiction,
and
you are not one of the eight House members that
wrote directly to Gensler at the SEC
in March of 2022 stating that SEC information gathering from FTX and other crypto exchanges was “burdensome”, “stifling innovation” and that it might violate Federal Law
(e) you acknowledge that Binance, Bitfinex, Huobi, Deribit etc domicile outside the US because of more stringent US rules
3
. US investors don’t transact in crypto offshore because there isn’t enough “regulatory clarity” onshore; they transact offshore since that’s where the crypto industry offers the highest margin lending, the widest selection of tokens and the widest array of derivative products (i.e., crypto free-for-all)
(f) you do not own any books, articles or pamphlets by Ayn Rand
In other words, “lack of regulatory clarity” criticism of the SEC after the FTX failure is often hypocritical nonsense
. Securities laws are rarely prescriptive and are instead part of a principles-based regulatory framework designed to be flexible enough to apply to new instruments as they’re created. The crypto industry litigated against retailer and exchange reporting requirements in the 2021 Infrastructure Act that are designed to prevent fraud, and both the Blockchain Association and the Association for Digital Asset Markets complained about SEC efforts to put crypto exchanges under its purview in January 2022
4
. Just ignore them.
For two very different views of the crypto world, compare our “
Maltese Falcoin
” piece from February 2022 to the hilarious profile of FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried from Sequoia Capital’s website, which you can still find archived online.#2: The Sirens Rule: Watch out for shifting priorities in developing countries
In Greek mythology, the Sirens lured sailors to their deaths by drawing them in with song. The same thing sometimes happens in emerging markets: countries enact policies to draw in foreign capital just before either defaulting on it, or enacting policies which then destroy its value. The Sirens Rule: beware of false promises and of shifting priorities.
The classic example of course is
Argentina
, whose external debt borrowing ballooned right before its bond defaults in 1989, 2001 and 2020
Russia
nationalized foreign assets as far back as 1917, a practice Putin then revived; by 2008, half of Russian industrial output was produced by corporations under state control
5
. Despite that history, foreign direct investment into Russia rose sharply from 2005 to 2013, right before Russia’s invasion of Crimea and the initial imposition of sanctions (which were tightened again in 2022 after its invasion of all of Ukraine). Firms whose investments are at risk: BP, Shell, Equinor, Exxon, ENI, Wintershall, German automakers and 4,000 other German companies doing business in Russia. In 2022, Russia banned foreign investors from selling Russian assets
The latest example is
China
, which enacted “market-friendly” policies that lured MSCI into increasing China’s weight in the Emerging Markets Equity Index to 40% by January 2021. Then, Xi’s campaign of progressive authoritarianism
6
began which led to the largest underperformance of China vs world equities on record (-50%)
See Three Sirens charts in the Appendix
#3: The Summers Rule: Pay attention to Larry
Larry Summers is willing to take unpopular positions when he thinks his economic views are right, even if they conflict with the economic orthodoxy of the day. The Summers Rule: when Larry talks you should listen.
In Larry’s February 2021 Op-Ed in the Washington Post, he argued that rapid labor market healing, deployment of pent-up savings and stimulus tacked on to the largest deficits in the post-war era would reignite wage/price inflation
7
. He was earlier than anyone else (only one month into the vaccination process), and he was right.
Here’s what I wrote at the time: “I think Larry is onto something here; I expect Powell to face difficult decisions well before the mid-term elections in 2022, particularly as it relates to how the Fed will message a policy exit for a stock market used to zero rates and lots of Fed asset purchases.
Markets are pricing in a Fed largely on hold for several
years
. Even if the Fed goes slow on the policy rate, the bigger question for markets is what happens to longer term rates; 2.5%+ inflation and 3.5% on 10-year US Treasuries could be a journey that involves substantial equity and credit market corrections, depending on how quickly we get there
.” Larry’s inflation road map ended up being a useful roadmap for us on financial markets.
Our 2023 Eye on the Market Outlook will be released as usual on January 1
st
. Have a safe and happy holiday season.Appendix charts: the Three Sirens1

MR. MICHAEL CEMBALEST: Good morning, everybody and welcome to the 2022 holiday Eye on the Market. First, I'm pleased to offer everyone this week's piece, a holiday gift I had commissioned for you. It's a one-of-a-kind non fungible token drawing in here of a Bored Ape. And if you follow the NFT market at all, you will know what that's all about. And it's a cute little ape and he's holding a dollar bill that he's burnt to a crisp, and his T shirt says Ape Innovation ETF. So there you go. My present to you.
Like 20 years ago, in 2002, 2022 was also a year when lots of unprofitable companies, not just NFTs, got repriced. The first chart here shows the remarkable similarity between the NASDAQ 100 spike and collapse 20 years ago to what happened this time around with all sorts of profitless innovation companies, online shopping, cryptos, backs, fintech, hydrogen metaverse, et cetera. The title of the chart is Dumb and Dumber. I think this time around was dumber, because we've all seen this movie before, and people should have been more in tune with it.
I've also got a couple of charts in here that update where we are on the YUKs and the MUCs. This is something I started writing about in our 2020 outlook, and it's how we monitor the price for equity risk. The YUCs are young, unprofitable companies. And the MUCs are the mega-valued companies with a PE of over 50. And roughly two-thirds of the YUC/MUC surge has now been reversed, which leaves a little bit left to go. But I think we're closer to the end of this YUC/MUC repricing than the beginning of it, for obvious reasons.
During the whole stimulus bonanza from the fed and from the treasury on fiscal policy, digital assets got priced at a hugely unrealistic premium, relative to physical assets. And now that monetary policy and fiscal policy are normalizing, I'm not surprised to see, for instance, a basket of farm equipment, office cleaning supplies and industrial REIT stocks outperforming one of the well-known innovation ETFs. And I'm also not surprised to see oil, gas and pipelines outperforming renewable energy again this year, for all the reasons that we discussed in our annual energy paper. You know, the world is a pretty tough and unforgiving place, and our job is to try and help you navigate that.
And on the energy issue, what was kind of remarkable this year is how many investors and politicians underestimated the importance of Russia. I mean, this is a country, how much damage could they do? Their share of world GDP is just 3%, which is the lowest in 200 years. And while that calculation was part of a broader underappreciation for thermal energy, ammonia, fertilizer and things like that, when the world was more captivated by what was going on in the wind and solar power industries. That's changing now.
Germany just finished building the first of five floating LNG regasification units. France is planning for a substantial nuclear renaissance. And China is importing as much Russian gas and coal as they possibly can as part of a broader geopolitical realignment. And so--and while Russia is laying waste to Ukraine's power grid, I wouldn't be surprised if there's a ceasefire at some point in the new year, partially driven by the need for Europe to regain access to some amount of Russian energy, probably oil, and whatever land-based pipelines can be reopened.
To finish up 2022, I've created three rules for investors to follow. And I'm going to briefly talk about them now. The first rule is the Gensler rule. Okay? So Gary Gensler is the SEC Commissioner. And obviously, this has to do with all of the stuff going on with FTX and people saying, well, why didn't the SEC do more? Existing rules give the SEC jurisdiction over crypto intermediary platforms, you know, exchanges and broker dealers, to prevent fraud, manipulation, front running wash sales and the usual suspects.
But in order for the SEC to get involved, they typically have to make a determination that this interim--crypto intermediary is trafficking in securities. And that's a very loaded phrase. And when it does so, the SEC is acting pursuant to a Howey test, H-O-W-E-Y, that's many decades old, although it's been upheld recently by the federal courts. And when they do act according to this Howey test, they're almost always acting over the objections of the entire crypto industry, a lot of politicians in both parties, very influential venture capital firms and even people within the SEC itself.
So you can criticize Gensler and the SEC here if you want, but the Gensler rule that I am proclaiming is that you can only criticize them for what happened at FTX if you meet all of the following six criteria. Okay? Number one, you have stated that cryptocurrencies, although not Bitcoin, many of them qualify as securities and not commodities. And at the SEC, we should be the one making that determination based on the existing Howey test, unless Congress makes a new one. Two, you believe that the SEC should have responsibility for regulating onshore and offshore crypto exchanges when they're dealing with US customers on securities.
It's not that hard for the SEC and the CFTC to establish jurisdiction on offshore entities, because whenever they have a nexus with UN individuals, that's all they need. That's not very difficult to do. It's an open secret that US crypto investors are--can easily evade jurisdictional firewalls. And one estimate from the Wall Street Journal was about 60% of all crypto derivative trades were actually executed by US entities on the offshore unit of FTX.
Litmus test number three, you support the many speeches that Gensler and his predecessor at the SEC, Jay Clayton, made on crypto risks. You support the SEC's 100-plus crypto enforcement actions to date against things like Grayscale, Telegram, BlockFi, Coinbase, LBRY, et cetera. Number four, you're not one of the senators or congressional representatives that received campaign contributions from Coinbase, Digital Currency Group, Ripple, Blockchain Capital and places like that, that typically argue against SEC jurisdiction.
And you're also not one of the eight House members that wrote to Gensler in the SEC in March of this year complaining about SEC information gathering from FTX and other crypto exchanges. These eight House members, for each and in each party, wrote that these information requests were burdensome and stifling innovation. So there you go.
Fourth litmus test, you acknowledge that Binance and Deribit and Bitfinex and a lot of these other entities domicile outside of the United States because of more stringent US rules. US investors don't transact in crypto offshore because there's not enough regulatory clarity onshore, it's that they don't like the regulatory clarity that exists. US investors, crypto investors transact offshore since that's what the crypto industry offers the highest margin lending and the widest selection of token and derivative products.
And then the sixth one, litmus test, is you can't own any books or articles or pamphlets by Ayn Rand. If you do, you can't complain about the lack of SEC jurisdiction. The bottom line is, all of these comments from the crypto industry about the FTX failure being a consequence of lack of regulatory clarity is, in my opinion, a lot of self-interested nonsense. Securities regulations are rarely prescriptive and they're part of a broader framework that's designed to be flexible enough to apply to new instruments as they get creative.
The crypto industry litigated against requirements in the Infrastructure Act to prevent retailer fraud. They complained bitterly about SEC efforts to put crypto exchanges under their purview. I would advise you to simply ignore everything that they complained about as it relates to FTX and the SEC and everything else.
So for two very different views on the crypto world, I'll end this section by saying, just read our Maltese Falcoin piece from February of this year on crypto and compare that to the absolutely hilarious profile of deposed FTX CEO Fried that had--that was posted, at one point, on Sequoia Capital's website. But they took it down, but you can still find it archived online.
Two more rules for 2022, and then we'll wrap it up. One of them is the Siren's Rule. In Greek mythology, the Sirens lured sailors to their deaths. They would sing beautiful songs, and then the sailors would come in and they would drown them. The same thing happens sometimes in emerging markets. And the Siren's Rule is beware of false promises and shifting priorities.
The classic example, of course, is Argentina, that borrowed tons of money right before it defaulted in 1989, 2001 and 2020. And most of that money they borrowed was external debt. So the blueprint is, borrow lots of foreign capital and then default on it.
Another example is Russia. Russia has a long history of nationalizing foreign assets. They did so as far back as 1917. And then Putin revived that when he came into power. And by 2008, half of all of Russian industrial output was produced by companies that were under state control.
Despite that history, there was a lot of foreign direct investment in Russia from 2005 to 2013, right before Russia's invasion of Crimea. And then that prompted some sanctions. And then the sanctions were tightened again this year after it invaded the rest of Ukraine. There's lots of foreign direct investment at risk here from the big oil companies, German automakers, and 4,000 German companies that are doing business in Russia. So that's another example of watch out for shifting priorities.
And the last one is China. China enacted a lot of market friendly policies and--that lured MSCI into increasing China's weight in the Emerging Market Index to 40% by January of 2021. I mean, it was only 15% a decade before that. So right when China hits 40% of the whole EM equity index, drawing in lots of foreign capital, Xi's campaign, of what we can call progressive authoritarianism began, which obviously changed the business dynamics and valuations for a lot of Chinese companies that fell afoul of what the Chinese government was trying to do.
And then led to the largest underperformance of Chinese equities on record. Over the last three years, they've underperformed the rest of the world by 50%. So another example of that Siren's Rule, Chinese policies were very market friendly, lured in lots of capital, then the rules changed and foreign investors lost a lot of money.
The last--the last rule for this year for investors is the Summers' Rule, which I'm naming after Larry Summers. I know Larry a little bit, and what I know of Larry is that he's willing to take very unpopular positions when he thinks he's right, even if they conflict with some of the economic orthodoxy of the day. And so the Summers' Rule is that when Larry talks, you should probably listen to him.
In February of 2021, Larry was the one, before anybody else was doing it, arguing that the labor market was going to heal really rapidly, there was going to be a lot of pent-up savings deployed, and that stimulus tacked onto already massive deficits was going to--was going to reignite wage and price inflation. Very few people were saying it, very few people believed him. He was totally spot on. And I was one of the people that listened to him.
At the time, in our February Eye on the Market, right after his op-ed, I wrote that I think that Larry is onto something here and that Powell was going to face some difficult decisions well before the midterms. Markets were pricing in a Fed that was on hold for years. And I wrote that even if the Fed went slow on the policy rate, there was a big question for markets as to what happened when it would rise. And that that journey would involve substantial equity and credit market corrections, depending on the speed, which is exactly what happened. So Larry's inflation roadmap ended up being a useful roadmap for us, as well, on markets.
So let's see, good news and bad news. First, the bad news. The NFT that I've made for you has declined in value by 25% since you started listening to this podcast. The good news is our 2023 Eye on the Market will be released, as usual, on January 1
st
of next year. And I'd like to wish everybody a safe and happy holiday season. So long.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Investors have a role in helping to slow, stabilize, potentially reverse—or adapt to some inevitable—climate change.Dr. Sarah Kapnick, Sustainability Strategist, Senior Climate Scientist
*
The effects of climate change—extreme storms, heat, drought, rising seas—are being felt in every region of the world. They increase water and food scarcity, physical risks and damage to lives and property. To date, most climate investing has gone to building out renewable energy generation and storage. Adaptation, by contrast, has been underfunded. Looking at the sources of carbon (
EXHIBIT 1)
makes it clear that reducing energy emissions, important as it is, won’t be enough. Along with emissions
reduction
across all sectors, carbon
removal
and the
retrofitting
of physical assets for some inevitable climate change will be needed, too. Each of these three Rs offers investors a range of potential opportunities.How can investors participate in stabilizing climate change—achieving a “net-zero” world in which emissions from a range of sources are brought to zero or balanced out by carbon removal? Along with investments to reduce emissions in (decarbonize) the energy supply, here is a set of approaches that employ all three Rs—greenhouse gas reduction, removal and retrofitting—to adapt to climate change.
The three Rs of climate investing: Reduce, remove and retrofit
Investors can participate in these three approaches through associated investment opportunities in traditional and emerging technologies (
EXHIBIT 2
).Reduce:
Emissions
reduction, which includes the decarbonization of the energy supply, has been a major focus of climate investments. There are also less well-known opportunities to reduce energy demand and to transform other (nonenergy) carbon-intensive processes.
Decarbonization of the energy supply
can be accomplished by accelerating renewable energy generation and storage. The deployment of these technologies can be further incentivized through regulation such as market-based Renewable Portfolio Standards for utilities, which increase the amount of clean energy.
Reductions in energy
demand
can also decrease emissions (especially in the near term, before the power grid comes to rely on renewable sources) while reducing operating costs, making reductions economically desirable even absent climate considerations.
The transformation of carbon-intensive processes
is also needed—for example, introducing lower carbon versions of cement formulation; finding raw materials that can substitute for those presently derived from oil and gas (e.g., plastics, fertilizer); and improving resource efficiency more broadly to reduce demand for virgin raw materials, catalyze more recycling and develop a circular economy.
Remove:
Carbon removal is necessary to reach net zero in situations where in carbon-neutral substitutes are not available. Excess greenhouse gases can be removed (sequestered) from the atmosphere two ways—naturally and mechanically. Greenhouse gases can even be removed from the ocean, which absorbs CO
2
.
1
Nature-based carbon removal
: Carbon is naturally sequestered in trees, plants, soils and plankton. The mature forestry industry currently provides investible timber products.
2
Nonprofits, governments and private funders have supported the development of other nature-based removal projects (e.g., soils, kelp, mangroves), but standards for verifying carbon removal are still evolving.
Mechanical carbon removal
: The technology to lock carbon underground or within new materials is still nascent. The U.S. Department of Energy recently announced the Carbon Negative Shot, with the goal of reducing the cost of mechanical removal below USD 100 per ton of carbon or its equivalent (tCO
2
e).
3
For perspective, a similar program was developed for solar more than a decade ago. The success of today’s solar industry suggests such actions can bear fruit over time.
Retrofit:
The World Bank estimates that up to USD 500 billion will be needed each year until 2050 to globally adapt to climate change. Yet even as adaptation requires upfront costs, it can lead to multiples of benefits from avoided damages
4
We highlight three broad adaptation categories, each with potential investment opportunities.
Water efficiency:
Solutions are needed to increase water supply in the face of regional droughts, changes in precipitation patterns and overpumping of wells. In the U.S. in 2020, droughts alone caused USD 259 billion in damages.
5
Reinventing food and agriculture:
Global population growth and changing consumer habits will raise food demand by 2050, requiring greater agricultural productivity. At the same time, resource scarcity, from water to arable land, is placing stress on regional productivity. Agriculture will need to adapt to changing climate conditions and if it is to feed a greater number of people.
The built environment:
Investments are needed to protect against damage from climate extremes and to allow for continuous operations. Due to their multi-decade lifetimes, buildings and infrastructure need to be built or retrofit to withstand the climate of the future, in addition to climate change that has already happened.
Where do we go from here?
Some of these opportunities are spearheaded by start-ups seeking venture funding for innovations involving a higher risk of technological failure but potentially higher returns. More mature options, like energy production, have longer track records with lower return profiles. These differing return profiles create an opportunity for diversification across climate investing. All of these areas are important to addressing the effects of climate change, and investing across them can create robust return opportunities for investors.
Several nonprofits have developed grant programs, technology scaling and fundamental research on climate solutions. For more information, please look into Elemental Excelerator, Prime Coalition, Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, and Carbon180.

The wide spectrum of climate-related investments presents a unique opportunity. Contact your J.P. Morgan team to learn about potential investment opportunities that align to your goals.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.The sector is enjoying a resurgence that’s expected to stay strong. It’s time for you to think about travel and leisure like an investor.Jasmine Green
, Alternative Investments Specialist
Jason Cho, Private Investments Due Diligence, Real Estate
The U.S. travel and leisure sector—especially the portion catering to the affluent—has come roaring back to life as Americans, liberated from lockdowns, take pleasure trips in record numbers, visit restaurants, enjoy spas and play golf (seemingly unaffected by inflation).
Pre-pandemic, the overall travel and leisure industry enjoyed healthy annual growth for decades: U.S. consumer spending on travel and leisure grew by an annualized 7% from 1960 to 2019.
1
Of course, when COVID-19 spread across the world, travel and leisure was among the hardest-hit sectors. But fast-forward to vaccines, boosters and the lifting of travel restrictions—the U.S. consumer’s desire for leisure travel and recreation skyrocketed to 115% of the historical average.
2
Moreover, this growth is not expected to slow, especially in high-end consumer travel and leisure, as consumers increasingly prefer experiences over material goods and more people have the means to pay for them.
The opportunities for your portfolio are considerable—particularly in private equity, which offers access to hard-to-reach investments in resorts and clubs serving the affluent. If you’ve yet to consider private investments in luxury travel and leisure real estate, now may be the time.
The affluent are re-embracing travel
The broad travel and leisure sector currently accounts for approximately 10% of global GDP. But look ahead and global consumer spending in the sector is projected to increase by more than 2x in the next 10 years.
3
The desire to travel is even more pronounced among the mass affluent, a group that includes approximately 77 million people in the U.S. with household incomes in excess of $125,000 a year and $1 million in net worth.
Over the past year, visitor volumes at niche properties—notably boutique hotels, ski resorts and golf clubs (both U.S. and international)—neared, and in some segments even surpassed, pre-COVID levels.
4
Strong tailwinds also have arisen for the development of ecologically friendly resorts (“eco-resorts”) as well as Under-Canvas high-end “glamping” facilities in unusual locations, such as the Moab Desert in Utah.
5
Luxury travel and leisure assets act as a hedge against inflation
Travel and leisure has long been a strong sector.
While business travel has yet to fully recover from the pandemic, consumer-led travel has historically been far more resilient. Its post-pandemic growth outpaced that of many other sectors. Even over the most recent full economic cycle (2007–2019), U.S. consumer spending on travel and leisure rose by an aggregated 70%—more than any other industry.
6
Indeed, in an inflationary environment, investing in consumer-led travel and leisure offers both an implicit and explicit hedge to rising interest rates. This protective effect is visible across the hotel industry, but even more pronounced in luxury lodging.
Similarly, resorts’ annualized growth in net operating income has historically outperformed hotels generally and handily outpaced the inflation index.
To invest in travel industry trends: Think ‘private markets’
One of the most exciting and potentially profitable ways to invest in luxury travel and leisure is to find specialized private equity managers offering long-term access to unlisted investments and leveraging their knowledge as seasoned owner-operators.
Think of your favorite travel and leisure destinations: Most of these luxury properties—whether resorts, marinas, golf clubs or ski lodges—are not owned by publicly traded companies. (In the United States alone, there are about 10 times more private than public companies).
7
Private equity allows for an owner-operator model in an industry that is fragmented by geography and asset type—and that creates interesting investment opportunities.
For private equity managers with strong capital reserves and an owner-operator mindset, market disruption can be an opportunity to add to their holdings, upgrade existing assets and invest in new leisure trends, such as high-end “glamping.”
Owner-operators are also able to directly drive performance by selecting the private company’s leaders. They can use leverage to enhance returns. And longer-term investment horizons allow private funds to maximize equity value.
Investors might want to be in it for the long term, as growth may take years to fully play out, given the projected increase in the number of mass affluent. Private equity is one way to access these companies; it can also provide you with specialists who can tailor your exposure by, for example, excluding corporate travel and focusing on more resilient, illiquid assets found in the luxury consumer travel and leisure sector.
In addition, as capital becomes more expensive due to rising rates, private equity firms may serve as key sources of financing for the acquisition and development of new luxury assets.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Keep your family safe by helping them understand what’s at stake.Statistics confirm what we all can readily observe: Children and young adults today live their lives with mobile devices in their hands. Notably, people aged 16 to 29 spend three hours a day on social networking platforms—the most of any age group, and roughly twice the amount of time spent by adults between the ages of 45 and 54.

Given this almost constant access to the internet and social media, it can be hard for teens to resist sharing family news with friends. Unfortunately, in the wrong hands, information about an upcoming vacation or family gathering, a new home or other major purchase, etc., can put your family’s financial resources, privacy and/or physical security at risk.
Yet, trying to impose guidelines or limits on a young adult’s online activities more often leads to frustration—for parents and their children alike!—rather than to improved security.
Instead of lecturing, try providing your teenagers with a meaningful context for your concerns. Clients who take the time to fully explain the potential risks of posting personal information online report their children are more ready and willing to limit what they reveal online.
These two real life examples can help you illustrate your concerns:
Vacation plans go awry
Planning a vacation for themselves and their three teenage children, Miranda and Dan decided to charter a jet and fly the family directly to a long overdue beach vacation rather than struggle through multiple connecting flights during a pandemic.
So when the charter jet company emailed a bill for the membership and the details for the upcoming trip, Miranda and Dan readily sent the $100,000 payment.
What the family didn’t know was that the private jet company’s email system had already been hacked, giving cybercriminals direct access to the firm’s client list, which included many wealthy individuals and families. The criminals then researched the names on the client list—focusing on the social media accounts of those clients’ children—for information about upcoming trips.
Sure enough, this family’s teenagers had shared the upcoming vacation details on social media, including their destination and planned activities. This provided enough details for the cybercriminals to craft a personalized email to the parents that appeared credible.
What they should have done
Before paying that bill, Miranda or Dan should have contacted the jet company by phone (i.e., not by replying to the email they received) to verify that both the payment request and the account number were legitimate. Further, the parents should have reminded their teenagers not to post information about the family’s upcoming plans. In this case, a single post became a cyber-safety lapse that left the family vulnerable to the cybercriminals’ scam. Indeed, children of all ages should be reminded not to post on social media their/the family’s intended travel plans or provide location updates during the trip.
A business is made vulnerable
Seeing himself as a social media influencer in training, 14-year-old Ben posted—and boasted—online about an upcoming trip with his grandfather. “Off to Paris for two weeks! See ya!,” he told his social media friends, sharing pictures of the plane, his grandfather and key details of their itinerary.
What Ben didn’t know was that cybercriminals had been monitoring his social media accounts as well as those of various other family members. With the information Ben unwittingly provided, fraudsters were able to launch a successful social engineering campaign aimed at the grandfather’s business, using phishing or vishing to facilitate a false wire transfer—eventually costing the firm thousands of dollars during the two weeks Ben and his grandfather were on vacation.
What they should have done
First and foremost, Ben should have been made to understand that sharing personal information online poses potential risks for his entire family. Additionally, the grandfather should have trained his office staff to recognize the warning signs of phishing attempts, including: poor grammar and spelling, urgent language, hyperlinks or attachments, fake logos, a vague email address and missing/vague contact information. Further, the office team should have been instructed not to assume that all incoming requests are genuine, even if the requester has plenty of information about the business or owner. Before making payments, the accounting team should have confirmed the legitimacy of the request via an alternate, verified method.
Involve teens in your family’s cyber defenses
Given the amount of time children spend each day on social media, online games and other internet sites, it’s critical for them to understand how their words and actions can have inadvertent, and serious, consequences. In addition to those noted above, here are some protective steps to take:
Cultivate your teens’ cybersecurity awareness
Start talking to your children at an early age about online safety precautions, computer security and the family’s need for privacy—the same way you talk to them about other dangers they might encounter in their daily lives:
Deepen the conversation about the risks and potential consequences as your children mature.
Explain how cybercriminals cast a wide net to gather information about an individual or family, steadily adding to the overall picture and enhancing the odds of a cyberattack (or home break-in) being successful.
Point out that cybercriminals/hackers often pose as representatives of legitimate organizations (schools, banks, charities) or businesses (retailers, vendors, contractors). Moreover, these scammers use email, phone calls, texts and social media to persuade their targets to provide sensitive data/information, such as passwords and account numbers. To defend themselves, your children should use strong passwords and system controls. However, their best protection is exercising an abundance of caution.
Emphasize the importance of the family’s privacy and security
Talk about the danger inherent in your children revealing upcoming vacation plans/family gatherings, checking into locations online, or posting real-time photos of themselves/others regardless of where they are.
Encourage all family members to:
Create strong and complex passwords, change them frequently and never share them.
Update operating systems and anti-virus software on computers and mobile devices to the latest versions, as soon as they become available.
Advise caution when clicking on links or attachments sent to them in emails: Mobile device users are more likely to click on phishing emails and embedded links.
Encrypt sensitive information, such as account numbers, tax information and other personal information, before emailing it.
Confirm the identity of a requester via an alternate, verified method, and check the email address: Scammers often use spoofed email addresses to send what seem to be legitimate requests.
Helping your children fully understand the need for being cautious on social media—and on the internet more broadly—will help them become active members of your family’s cyber and security defense team.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Growth will likely weaken, but we see a path to a better economic outcome and stronger-than-expected equity returns.Our 2023 outlook anticipates weaker economic growth and stronger markets. Although we believe a historic global central bank tightening cycle will rein in inflation, recessions are likely in the United States and Europe. Growth will continue to be challenged in China and Latin America.
Given that macroeconomic backdrop, we’re focusing on core fixed income as a valuable portfolio ballast. Within equities, we broadly prefer quality and cash flow generation.
At the same time, we do see a path to a better economic outcome that could lead to stronger-than-expected performance for risk assets such as equities and high yield bonds. A mix of three factors could get us to this better place:
A benign inflation outcome
Resilient consumers and businesses
Global white swans (i.e., positive geopolitical developments that would improve investor sentiment)
We focus here on the U.S. outlook.
A benign inflation outcome
Many data points signal that inflation is past its peak. Durable goods prices are decelerating rapidly, as are import prices and producer input prices. U.S. crude oil and gasoline prices are at their lowest levels of the year.
The most recent U.S. Consumer Price Index data showed a 20-basis-point month-on-month gain in core inflation—the slowest pace of the year. Shelter inflation, which accounted for much of that move, lags the real-time private data that is signaling a significant deceleration in market rent increases.Critically, this deceleration in inflation has coincided with only a slight rebalancing in the labor market. The quits rate and the job openings rate (which are good measures for the intensity of labor demand) have fallen from peak levels. But non-farm payrolls data suggest that hiring is continuing at a relatively brisk pace of about 250,000–300,000 jobs per month. The widely followed unemployment rate hovers near historical lows.
In short, an economic “soft landing” looks possible if inflation can continue falling faster than the labor market deteriorates.
Resilient consumers and businesses
So far, cracks in the economy have been limited to interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as real estate and financial activity, and to businesses that expanded to meet pandemic-era demands that proved to be transitory.
Overall though, the U.S. economy looks to be in decent shape. Consumer spending could accelerate modestly as a slowing pace of inflation leads to a recovery in real income. Higher U.S. mortgage rates have crushed marginal activity. However, more than 90% of new mortgages are fixed, so the actual cost of borrowing for many households has not changed even as rates have risen. The quits rate may be past its peak, but it’s still a signal that workers are feeling confident about their ability to find new jobs.
Corporate debt levels seem manageable, as companies are largely locked into lower rates. Profit margins have proved more resilient than expected, given elevated inflation and wages. Throughout 2022, businesses have had to contend with shifts in consumer spending. Demand for goods and apparel weakened relative to the demand for in-person services that were largely shuttered at the height of the COVID-19 era. In general, businesses have adjusted fairly well. And in the coming months and quarters, inventory and pricing swings could become less drastic.Finally, a slower pace of monetary policy tightening (and perhaps even a pause in rate hikes) could give CEOs the confidence they need to borrow money to invest in new plants or make acquisitions. Consumers and businesses may acclimate to a higher interest rate environment more successfully than many expect.
Global white swans in Ukraine and China
The war in Ukraine and China’s property downturn and COVID lockdowns have cast a pall on economic and market outlooks. They have also led to a much stronger U.S. dollar, which is itself a headwind to global growth.
A positive shift on any of these fronts would likely ease friction for the global economy, resulting in a weaker dollar. And the change would almost certainly lead to better investor sentiment.Still, even if Russia and Ukraine were to negotiate a settlement, Europe will still need to make significant changes to its energy infrastructure, which could take many years.
In China, a policy pivot toward reopening the economy, embracing Western mRNA vaccines, boosting the property sector or issuing more market-friendly rhetoric could jumpstart markets, given current, depressed sentiment and investors’ limited exposure to Chinese markets.
Investment implications
Some combination of these factors—a benign inflation outcome, continued resilience of consumers and businesses, and global white swans—could have profound implications for markets. It could potentially lead to outperformance of risk assets (such as stocks and high yield bonds) over “safe havens” such as core fixed income or gold.
The U.S. dollar would likely weaken further. European and Chinese stocks could lead a global equity rally. U.S. small- and mid-cap companies might well outperform large caps, given their lower valuations and higher sensitivity to economic growth.
Even though core bonds would probably underperform risk assets, lower inflation and a less aggressive stance from central banks would likely lead to lower yields and solid performance from investment grade fixed income.
So, while our base case scenario for 2023 sees weakening growth across the global economy, if we have learned anything from the last three years, it’s to expect the unexpected. A positive economic outcome certainly fits that bill for 2023.

https://privatebank.jpmorgan.com/gl/en/insights/giving/why-not-explore-philanthropy-with-the-whole-family-this-year,"PhilanthropyWhy not explore philanthropy with the whole family this year?authors:- Jamie Hacklemanpublished Date:- Dec 12, 2022Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.
Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.During holiday gatherings, consider making philanthropy and your family’s legacy a special focus.’Tis the season to celebrate. And for many families, coming together at the end of the year is also an opportunity to cheer family milestones and discuss topics of shared interest, such as reviewing assets and investments, as well as identifying future goals.
In keeping with the spirit of the holiday season, many families notably focus their meetings on philanthropic intentions.
Giving-oriented discussions can help a family find ways to enhance their legacy and demonstrate shared values. These conversations can also foster communication across generations, and help children and grandchildren prepare for carrying on important family traditions.
Here are three ways to focus on giving back in your family meeting.
Explore
charitable
interests and issues
Family meetings are an opportunity for members to share their interests and values.
In this setting, family members can discuss such topics as individual and shared passions; guiding beliefs and motivations; and the time and ability they have to engage in giving.
Use exploratory questions to help draw family members into the conversation. For example:
What motivates you to give?
What values influence your philanthropic decision making?
Are there issues, populations or geographies you are eager to explore further?
What do you want to accomplish with your giving?
How do you want to partner with family members on giving?
How much personal time are you able to commit to philanthropy?
Some families find it helpful to send out a questionnaire or survey before they meet to help participants prepare.
Coming out of these discussions, family members should have a better sense of shared themes and interests; ways the family might give together; and those willing to participate.
One family’s approach:
Set the stage for collaboration
Following a large business transaction, a married couple established a family foundation to support their longstanding interests in medical research and education.
As a next step, they scheduled a family meeting to explore how their three adult children might become actively involved in creating the family’s legacy. To prepare for this conversation, the couple sent each of their children a questionnaire asking them to describe their passions and interests, and the role they might play in the new foundation.
Over the course of the family meeting, it became clear that only one child wanted to take an active part in the foundation’s work. The other two preferred to focus their philanthropy on climate change and the environment.
Comfortable knowing that one child would lead the foundation, the family agreed to create a small pool of money to support the philanthropic efforts of the other two siblings.
Educate each other
Family meetings can be a forum for learning from each other as well as from specialists in a given field.
Consider inviting industry experts or nonprofit leaders to your meeting to help family members learn more about particular issues. Similarly, inviting other funders or outside advisors to talk about philanthropic trends, practices and considerations can help your family focus its giving efforts.
Seeing a nonprofit in action can also be a meaningful experience for a family; for example, by going together to visit an organization or volunteering at one of its events.
One family’s approach:
Tap a granddaughter’s expertise
In planning an upcoming gathering, grandparents asked a granddaughter to share her experience working at a local children’s hospital. Her talk brought to life the key issues and trends she witnessed day-to-day—and the important roles donors and volunteers play in improving the lives of the children served.
After her presentation, family members were eager to learn more about the hospital and its mission, so they arranged for a site visit. This firsthand experience, which included touring the facility and meeting with key hospital staff, helped family members see how their active involvement could make an important difference.
Align intentions and efforts
Family meetings can pave the way for the creation of a framework for collaborative giving.
Once families have explored their interests and motivations, they can use family meetings to:
Identify organizations to collectively support
Select ways to give together
Define individual roles and responsibilities
Create a deliberative process for how funding opportunities will be proposed, reviewed and selected
Decide on specific donations
One family’s approach:
Replace individual giving with collective support
For years, family members had given separately to various charities. Now they wanted to use their family meeting to decide on a joint gift.
After discussing their collective interests and the legacy they wanted to create, the family decided to give to land conservation efforts in the state in which their great-grandparents built their business.
Each family member had an opportunity to propose an organization to donate to during the meeting. A group vote decided on one organization the family would support.
Finding alignment and clarifying expectations help set the stage for successful family giving practices.
We can help
Effective family meetings can help achieve many critical goals, including deepening individual members’ engagement in collective philanthropic efforts. Your J.P. Morgan team can assist you in using your family meetings for giving conversations.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Despite ongoing economic turmoil, London’s luxury property sector remains shielded from wider market falls.We are seeing a strong interest from our international clients in acquiring Prime Central London properties.Our preferred fair value model for GBP/USD, which anchors our medium-term outlook, points to an eventual recovery in the exchange rate to 1.15-1.20. However, as of now, we don’t see that valuation gap closing before Q3 2023. We see risks in the exchange rate skewed lower over the winter as the UK continues to deal with high inflation, a tepid central bank and large current account deficit.The near-term weakness in the pound definitely presents opportunity for professional real estate investors (funds) who are dollar based to look into London and the UK more broadly for interesting buying opportunities and entry points based on the currency. These funds also provide the potential to diversify across different sub-sectors of the real estate market as well. With inflation also a key risk, multi-family homes and industrial assets have historically protected well in inflationary environments.Liam Bailey, Global Head of Research, Knight Frank
Kate Everett-Allen, Head of Global Residential Research, Knight Frank
While the rest of the country saw property prices rebound to new highs during the pandemic, the London market registered muted price growth. A combination of Brexit uncertainties, Covid-19 lockdowns and travel restrictions have all conspired to keep prices down in London’s luxury property market in recent years.
According to Knight Frank, prime prices in central London grew by a modest 2.7% in the year to September as prime property continued a gradual recovery after years of political uncertainty and tax hikes.
On the other hand, London's super-prime market has seen activity levels reach a six-year high in May, with prices for properties above £10 million rising by 3.6%.
However, with a deteriorating economy, inflation surging and interest rates climbing, it is likely there will be a correction in wider UK house prices.So what does all this economic uncertainty mean for investors?
While average property prices are expected to fall by 10% over the next two years, the impact on the high-end property market should be a lot less, as Knight Frank observes. Predominantly due to higher levels of affluence, fewer highly-leveraged homeowners, more cash buyers and a broader base of returning international buyers.
In the next year, Knight Frank expects prices to fall by 3% in prime central London before rising in subsequent years. Similar declines are forecast for prime properties in outer London and the wider UK house markets as the cost of living rises.
Liam Bailey, Global Head of Research at Knight Frank, says that even with prices cooling, the high-end property market in the UK remains extremely robust.
“At the moment, we've got strong pipelines of buyers registering to purchase property and good offer volumes in the market. If you've got good-quality, well-presented property in good locations there is healthy demand.”
There is real opportunity for investors in the West London prime market where values haven’t shifted since 2015. In terms of areas in high demand, Chelsea remains very popular while Mayfair is also strong due to restricted stock. Little Venice and Maida Vale remain attractive for people who prefer smaller properties in locations that are an easy commute into central London, while Notting Hill continues to go from strength to strength.
Q4 2022 3 month change in rents and sales on Prime property shown here on page 2.
Overseas buyers look to snap up luxury property
The declining value of the British pound has made investment in the UK luxury property market extremely attractive to foreign investors. After briefly rallying in 2021, the value of the pound has been gradually falling throughout this year. However, after former Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng announced his controversial mini-budget in September, it plummeted to an all-time low against the dollar.For overseas buyers, especially those whose currency is USD or AED, the slump in the pound equates to a huge significant discount when looking to acquire property in London’s elite neighbourhoods. Research from Knight Frank illustrates that some of London’s most desirable properties are nearly 40% cheaper in dollar terms than they were at their peak in 2014.
Knight Frank has observed a steady increase in American investors who are using this as an opportunity for their longer-term investment plans to diversify abroad. London properties are not just attractive to our American friends, but the decline in the pound has also increased interest from buyers in the Middle East, who are also looking to benefit from the boost in property affordability.
Bailey says: “The weak pound against the dollar obviously has created a buying opportunity for overseas purchases. We've definitely seen an uptick in demand from the US and Middle Eastern buyers. Buyers from countries with currencies that are pegged to the dollar also see it as a big opportunity and we expect the Asian Covid restrictions ease.”
Market fundamentals remain strong
Despite the looming economic headwinds, the fundamentals of the UK luxury property market remain sturdy. London is still one of the most desirable locations in the world to live, and its luxury property market continues to attract the global elite and fund investors likewise.The capital’s property market is insulated from the trends that affect the rest of the market, making it attractive for investors . The recent volatility in the pound is helping to drive foreign investment. Earlier this year, one of the wealthiest families in the Middle East, sold their five-bedroom, 6,500 sq ft Knightsbridge home close to Harrods to a Lebanese tycoon for just under £20 million.
There were 155 transactions above £10 million in London in the year to April 2022, according to Knight Frank data. This was an increase of 19% on the previous 12-month period and the highest total in seven years. And it’s not just international buyers. With London’s social and cultural life resuming and offices reopening after the pandemic, domestic demand for luxury homes has been revived.
This is not a short term reawakening - with recent volatility in the pound helping to drive foreign investment, the prices in prime central London are expected to outperform other UK markets over the next five years. And though rising interest rates may be an issue for buyers, Bailey does not believe the looming recession will have a big effect on property investment in London.
He says: “The fundamental driver of the housing market in the capital is the strength of the London economy. With the UK likely to move into recession towards the end of the year, the question is, will this make London less attractive for inward investment? I don’t believe it will.
“Some of the recent developments in investments in central London are really beginning to pay dividends in terms of the kind of lifestyle on offer for wealthy individuals globally. London is still the largest financial business cluster in Europe and the logical place for Middle East and Asian investors to come to.”
Hedge your bets
Even when other regional markets falter, London has a unique ability to keep delivering good rates of capital growth and stable rental returns in the long term.Consequently in today’s inflationary environment, nobody wants to be sitting on cash. With prices soaring and growing economic uncertainty, investors are seeking a safe haven – and property can offer this.
Real estate can offer attractive returns and it serves as an effective hedge against inflation because market values are closely aligned with consumer prices and tend to rise over time.
During times of uncertainty, property values also generally remain resilient. The global financial crisis in 2008 led to UK house prices plummeting by 15%, but the market recovered to pre-crash levels within four years.
Investing in rental property can also be seen as a very attractive prospect against the effects of inflation. Since rental contracts are typically short in duration – usually around 12 months – landlords can renegotiate rents regularly, meaning that they can be adjusted for inflation. Tenants are more likely to pay the increase as it can be difficult to find a similar property elsewhere, especially in London where demand is high and supply is dwindling. Commercial real estate is also a good option for investors, generally providing a higher yield than residential property.
Stock levels remain low by historical standards, even though the number of new prospective tenants looking for property across London in September was 68% above the five-year average. As a result of this imbalance, Knight Frank expects rental values to end this year 15% higher in prime central London and 12% in prime outer London.
Bailey observes that “Demand for accommodation is incredibly high in the rental market, but there’s a dearth of property. We have got so many tenants looking to take space in London, rents have moved up about 20% over the past 12 months. Part of that is a result of the COVID bounce, but the rental market is incredibly strong at the moment. It’s very difficult for tenants right now to actually get the accommodation they want.
“For anyone thinking of investing and taking a longer-term view in terms of where they think rates will settle and then move to over the next few years, the rental market is a very strong proposition at the moment.”If we consider the Prime Central London capital value discount (2014 vs 2022) and the pound depreciation, overseas buyers are receiving a healthy discount. Discounts range from 29% with the Singapore dollar, to 32.7% with the US dollar. A 32% discount on a £2.5 million property is £800,000.This table and bar chart show the projected growth in the Prime Central London and Prime outer London rental income being above 30% cumulative from 2022 – 2026.Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.

The End of the Affair
The affair with the market catalysts of the last decade is over now, and a new era of investing beginsThe tattered posters on the kiosk show the remnants of some of the equity market’s recent catalysts. The largest combined monetary and fiscal experiment in recorded history is ending now, and a major growth slowdown is coming to the US and Europe. But be prepared to take advantage of equity market declines when they occur since a slowdown is already reflected in a lot of asset prices. US inflation will cool enough for the Fed to pause rate hikes at 5% in the spring. While globalization is in partial retreat, there are opportunities for investors in China after a brutal repricing in equity and property markets, and in global fixed income given waning Central Bank repression.LISTEN TO THE PODCAST

The 2023 Outlook - The End of the Affair[START RECORDING]
FEMALE VOICE:  This podcast has been prepared exclusively for institutional, wholesale, professional clients and qualified investors, only as defined by local laws and regulations.  Please read other important information, which can be found on the link at the end of the podcast episode.
MR. MICHAEL CEMBALEST:  Good morning and welcome to the 2023 Eye on the Market Outlook podcast.  The Eye on the Market this year is called The End of the Affair, and it’s about all of the things that have been driving financial markets over the last few years, and particular in 2020 and 2021 that are ending now.  The cover itself is inspired by the kiosk scene from the movie The Third Man with Joseph Cotten and Orson Welles.  If you haven’t seen it, it’s a great movie.  My mother grew up a couple of blocks from where it was filmed.
And the posters on a kiosk refer to some of those catalysts which are ending, whether it’s profitless innovation, quantitative easing, the notion of geopolitical change through trade, modern monetary theory, a rapid transition to renewables, some of the nonsense, Metaverse and Fintech narratives, which are falling apart, et cetera.
The big picture is that the largest combined monetary and fiscal experiment in the history of the United States is ending now.  And in large part, because of that, there’s a major growth slowdown coming ahead to the US and Europe.  My advice is avoid the trap of becoming more bearish when we get corrections, because those are the kind of corrections that I think it would make sense to take advantage of when they occur.  In the history of recessions, equities tend to bottom well before GDP, payrolls, earnings, housing, peak delinquencies in corporate debt and household credit, things like that.   And of all the things to follow, the ISM survey tends to be the best indicator, coincident indicator when there’s a bottom in equity.  So we spend a lot of time looking at that.
There are several sections in the Eye on the Market this year.  We’re going to take a look at the leading indicators and what equity markets are pricing in, inflation, which we think will cool enough in the US so the Fed can pause 5% or so in the spring, what’s going on with globalization, stock picking, and Fed policy, the regulatory wave coming right for the Fintech and crypto world, where we see value in global fixed income now that financial oppression’s finally ending after a decade, couldn’t come soon enough for me, and then some closing thoughts on mRNA vaccines and the moon landing in 1969.
So there’s lots of charts in here.  I’m not going to discuss everything on this podcast.  I’m just going to highlight some of the things that I think are the most important to look at.  In the introduction, we have a couple of charts that show the models that we use to predict where the manufacturing surveys are going.  So in other words, manufacturing surveys are a leading indicator.  We’re going to try to predict where the leading indicators themselves are going. And when we look at orders, inventories, and some of the other things that drive the manufacturing surveys, we think they’re headed for mild recessionary territory sometime in the spring.
Now whether there is a recession or not, from a technical perspective, is almost beside the point.  Remember in 2001, the NBER wasn’t even sure if there was a recession and the equity markets went down 40% anyway.  Corporate profits is what we care more about ‘cause of their impact on equity markets.  Our models on corporate profits point to something like a 10 to 12, maybe 13% decline next year compared to this year.  And so the first section gets into the question of the repricing that has taken, that has taken place so far.
And one of my favorite charts called Dumb and Dumber superimposes this cycle with Metaverse, hydrogen, Fintech, SPACs, crypto, and other profitless nonsense against the NASDAQ 100 from 1998 and 2003, and it fits pretty well so ar.  And I think that the vast majority of the repricing on some of these stocks has already taken place.  Now to be clear, the equity market is no bargain.  The price-to-earnings ratio is almost exactly on the long-term average of about 16 to 17 times next year’s earnings.  And most of the valuation indicators we look at are back to pre-COVID levels, but certainly not at the distressed levels of 2009 or even 2012.  And for that reason, I do think we’re going to have a correction of some kind in the spring as the reality of the growth slowdown and the earnings slowdown gets closer.
That said, we’re much closer to the end than the beginning of some of these repricings.  Peloton’s now priced at one-time sales.  A couple of years ago it was priced at 19 times sales.  And once you’ve got a bunch of these stocks trading at these distressed levels, I think the right question to ask is what will it take for some of them to become profitable?   And so we look back at the dot-com cycle, and there are some charts in here that show that a good number of these unprofitable companies last time became profitable by 2004 and their stocks performed pretty well.  So the opportunities for stock pickers to kind of sift through the wreckage of all these profitless companies and identify the ones that have a chance to make some money is worth doing.
I first started writing about the yucks and the mucks, which refer to these young unprofitable companies, early in 2020, when their valuations went bananas.  The charts in the outlook here show the extent to which these things have repriced.  And again, we’re not back to 2000, 2010 levels; we’re somewhere around two-thirds of the way, or maybe even 75% of the way repriced on some of this profitless innovation stuff.
In any case, take a look at this first section.  We’ve got some other charts in here that show some other trends we expect to continue, physical, the equity markets of physical assets outperforming digital assets, traditional energy outpacing renewable energy, traditional banks outpacing Fintech and things like that.
The second chapter, the second topic in the outlook gets into this question of the Fed and what it’s going to be able to do.  We expect inflation pressures to subside and allow the Fed to pause at 5% and see where things go from there, and we also expect the ten-year Treasury to remain below 4% next year.  Inflation expectations have already declined to something around 2.25% percent, so that’s moving in the Fed’s direction.  And so we think that the Fed’s going to be able to take their foot off the pedal sometime in the spring, once they get to 5%.
Now the challenge is clearly on the wage front.  What makes this cycle different than all the other cycles we’ve had in the past is in the past, you’ve had changes in supply and demand of goods and services, but you never had some kind of strained secular reduction in the labor supply.  This time around we had COVID, excess retirement, part of which was driven by COVID, and a collapse in immigration, which is now only starting to change.  So the tightness of the labor markets is really remarkable.
And we’ve got some charts in here that look at the tightness of the labor force in terms of job-fill rates, how much, what premium people get to switch jobs rather than remain, job openings relative to the workforce, things like that.  And so far there have been some big layoffs in tech and home building, and that’s about it.  Wage growth, though, is finally rolling over, as you’d expect it would.  We’re in the midst of the fastest Fed hiking cycle on record, not the largest number of basis points, but the fastest.  So wages are starting to roll over.
And here’s where I think the good news comes in for the Fed.  The supply chains are cooling a lot, used car prices are down 20%, and obviously you have a lot more to fall.  Inventories of new cars, my wife and I went someplace and we were shopping for a car, and the lot was practically empty.  People were skateboarding in it.  So used, sorry, new car inventories rose around 80% by December, compared with a year earlier.  They’re still way below the 2019 levels.  But new car inventories are finally going up again.
And the big picture in the short term is housing.  And that’s where we really think that the Fed’s going to get some relief next year.  Housing is the largest component to core inflation.  On a reported basis, housing inflation is extremely high right now.  I think according to the CPI report, rents are rising at something like 8 to 9% a year.  But the official data in the CPI captures a lot of stuff that’s been going on over the last 18 to 24 months.  And the more recent data is showing 3, 4% increases in rents way down from where they were just a few months ago.
So on a more timely basis, real estate is slowing, and of course it is.  We have a chart in here showing mortgage costs as a percentage of household income going back to the late ‘40s.  Other than a few moments in 1979, there haven’t been too many levels like where they are now.  So the increase in mortgage rates is really kind of really hammering the housing markets, and we have a chart in here that shows that housing activity measured by existing home sales has fallen as fast and as much as it did during the double-dip recession in the early 1980s.  So housing is getting crushed and the Fed is going to take notice, and has already indicated, of course, that they’re aware of what’s going on.  And so I think that’s one of the reasons we think that the Fed’s going to be able to pause at 5%.
And one of the things that the Fed does is, in addition to looking at where the funds rate is, they compute something called a proxy funds rate that measures not just where the fund’s rate is, but the impact of all their other policies, like the unwinding of quantitative easing and shrinking their balance sheet and all that kind of stuff.  And at the same time that it looks like the Fed funds rate, let’s say, is 4%, this proxy funds rate is around 6.5%, and that’s the highest gap between the two since the Fed started doing this around 20 years ago.  And so it’s another way of understanding that financial conditions are actually tighter than just what the funds rate on its own would indicate, and which is why we think that the Fed’s going to be able to take a breather.
There’s a few charts in here on the long run related to the replication of supply chains and in particularly the energy transition, all of which we think are clearly inflationary.  And if you really want to understand what’s going on in the energy transition, take a look at this one chart that we have in here that shows that when you add wind and solar power, you really can’t decommission that much natural gas capacity, ‘cause you still need backup thermal capacity.
There are some wild stories all over the country during this cold spell that have made it quite clear, particularly as people start electrifying transportation and home heating, that you definitely need backup thermal power for times when wind and solar generation plummets, and we are nowhere near a world where utility-scale battery storage can fill the gap.  Most of that stuff lasts for four hours, maybe six, not several days or a couple of weeks.
So it’s inflationary, this energy transition, because you essentially have to build out all this wind and solar power.  On top of that, you have to build and maintain backup thermal capacity as well.  So we have some charts in here.  We’ll go into more detail in the energy paper, which should come out sometime in May.  But between the thermal power, the additional grid investment associated with wind and solar, which tend to be located far from where people live, and then replicating these Chinese supply chains for all the raw materials and intermediate goods, it’s going to be inflationary in the long run.
We also discuss in here Europe, if you’re interested, they’ve got a peculiar problem related to the fact that all electricity producers get paid the marginal cost.  And so when natural gas prices go up, everybody gets paid the marginal rate that the gas-powered electricity producers are paid.  And obviously that doesn’t make sense because you’re generating massive windfall profits for electricity producers based on hydro, nuclear, and other renewables.  And so they’re trying to sort that out and may be able to shield the population from half the price shock, but the other half is still pretty big, which is why we think that Europe’s going to have a tough time next year.
We have a section on globalization.  I think people spend too much time arguing on the semantics here.  We try to get into the big picture, which is globalization has three main components, exports trade, foreign/direct investment, and portfolio flows in public companies and in debt.  And all of these have fallen from where they were a few years ago, but are nowhere near kind of a de-globalized world.
So globalization is definitely in retreat, but it’s not collapsing.  What’s collapsing specifically is this European and US conceit that you can change other countries through trade, through a policy of constructive engagement.  That’s really what has collapsed, whether it’s, so now you see the European financial and energy embargo on Russia.
And then you’re seeing a really broadening US trade and capital war against China, which is, if people thought Biden was going to soften up on this based on what Trump had done with the tariffs, they got it backwards because the Biden administration has totally doubled down.  First of all, they’ve increased the number of entities on the restricted list for purposes of exporting certain semiconductor equipment and IP from 50 in 2018 to 500.  That’s the number of entities, including China’s flagship memory producer and other companies.  These entities are subject to something called the US Foreign Direct Product Rule, which means the US will try to enforce its export restrictions on non-US companies from reselling US equipment or IP to China, and China’s share of US imports is declining.  New OECD direct investment into China is falling.  The number of US investigations into Chinese FDI into the United States are picking up.
And then recently the Secretary of Commerce, Raimondo, talked about restrictions on outbound investment, so not just restrictions on Chinese investment in the US, new restrictions on US investment into China.  And as an example, Raimondo mentioned the fact that in the Chips Bill, if you get any money at all from the Chips Bill, you can’t invest any money, whether it’s that money or any other money, in advanced technology facilities in China for ten years.
And we have some quotes in here from Jake Sullivan, who’s the US National Security Advisor on the end of constructive engagement and how they view China and the fence that they’re trying to build.  And these have pretty big implications for investors, one example of which is have you looked at what’s happened recently to the prices of certain semiconductors stocks.  They have plummeted in the wake of some of these export restrictions.  So we have some information on here on that, which you can look at.
The interesting thing about the semiconductors, though, is as desperate as both China and the US are to disconnect themselves from Taiwan, it’s going to be really hard to do.  And we go into some of the details here.  But semiconductors, particularly the advanced ones, are the Fabergé eggs of industrial products.  They are incredibly costly to make.   The facilities that make them are like Fabergé eggs in terms of how fine-tuned they have to be, and they’re very hard to build in other places.
So TSMC has begun the process of building one of its factories in Arizona, right.  Everybody’s made a big deal out of this.  Well, guess what? They’ve now mentioned that they’re having much higher operating costs, they don’t have trained personnel, they’re having construction snags, all of which may result in US chips being produced 50% higher than the same exact chip in Taiwan.  And they’re going to have real-time supply and operational connections required to Taiwan, so this isn’t really a milestone in semiconductor independence if you think about it that way.  A cynic would say that they agreed to produce chips at lower margins in the US simply to boost US support for Taiwan itself, which is a reasonable thing to do given everything else that’s going on.
And then China, people were shocked at European reliance on Russia for around 25% of its energy before the invasion of Ukraine.  China is 70% reliant on Taiwan for semiconductors.  So that dwarfs the European reliance on Russian energy.  And China really hasn’t made a lot of progress on its domestic semiconductor production goals, little baby steps here and there.
We have some information here on some of the specifics of how these semiconductor facilities operate.  They have to be 10,000 times cleaner than a hospital surgical room.  The process of extreme ultraviolet photolithography is incredibly complicated.  There are hundreds of steps involved, some of them repeated.  They need exotic chemicals, gases, rare metals, materials, et cetera.  So try as they might, the US and Russia are going, the US and China are going to be more dependent than they’d like to be for many years to come on Taiwan.
Okay, so I’m going to wrap it up quickly.  We have, the last couple of sections look at active managers that most of whom did, struggled during the period of financial repression because financial repression by central banks collapsed risk premium, and it kind of voids the benefit of being a value-oriented manager in either fixed income or equities.  And as we move to a period of less financial repression and a return to positive real interest rates, I think the stock-picking prospects are going to pick up.
We have a section in here on the regulatory wave coming to Fintech.  There was a really important report from the Treasury in November, it was 128 pages, and it called for new oversight and enforcement of issues on the Fintech front, regulatory arbitrage, data privacy, risk controls, pricing transparency, fraud, predatory pricing, et cetera.  These are some of the things Jamie has been writing about in his annual shareholder letter for years.
And then we of course get into some of the crypto and unraveling which is leading to a regulatory wave as well.  The Maltese Falcoin paper we wrote last February really I did a good job, in my view, of identifying all the risks involved, because all the things that have happened since then were things that we mentioned in that paper at the time.
I do have a page here on J.P. Morgan, ‘cause a client said to me recently hey, you know, what about J.P. Morgan’s involvement within crypto?  Jamie described crypto as Pet Rocks in an interview in December, but you guys have made major crypto investments.  Like what’s the deal; isn’t that contradictory?  And there’s a page in here that explains that he basically has it wrong.  J.P. Morgan has done a bunch of stuff on the blockchain, but very little in terms of crypto.  And blockchain technology, simply put, is designed to improve efficiency and reduce cost in the execution of trading, processing, and custody of existing securities.  That’s all it is.  It doesn’t involve any token speculation or anything like that.  It is simply a cost reduction exercise using digital ledgers.
And by the way, there are a lot of applications where the blockchain doesn’t save any time or any money at all.  Take a look at the write-off the Australian Stock Exchange just had to take after a seven-year failed project to convert their back office to blockchain.  Then there’s crypto, which is owning, trading, and investing and lending in all these speculative tokens.  J.P. Morgan does not do that.  Anyway, there’s a page in here on that.
And then we’ve got a section on the kind of fixed-income options that look interesting at the beginning of 2023 given our economic outlook.  Some of the stuff we like would be munis, sovereign bond yields in Europe, China, and Mexico, mortgage risk, asset-backed papers.  Some floating-rate instruments look very interesting, like investment-grade floating-rate notes, commercial paper, some preferreds.
And we would stay away from anything related to high-yield, leverage loans, which are certainly not pricing in any, much of a slowdown.  And then we have a discussion here on the temptation to load up on Brazil bonds, but there are, given their yields, domestically of around 13%, but there are some things we have to find out about the new Lula administration before doing so.
Okay, the last page is called Just the Vacs and Nothing but the Vacs.  Over the last three years, I did a lot of work on COVID.  I never wrote anything to any of our clients on the costs and benefits associated with some complicated policies, whether it was lockdowns, testing social distancing, schools, masks, mandated government vaccines.
Like I don’t have informed opinions on that stuff, because to have an informed opinion on those, you have to make an assessment of the benefits of those policies and the cost of those policies having to do with employment, small business creation, birth rates, household formation, medical treatment for non-COVID diseases, mental health.  And a lot of those things take the benefit of hindsight to figure out.
I do have a view on the continued efficacy of mRNA vaccines.  We talk about some new data coming from the CDC that looks just in September to November of this year.  The vaccines are still, the new bivalent vaccines are 75 to 85% effective with respect to the risk of hospitalization.  And so they really still, particularly for people over the age of 65, so very important to pay attention to this data.  And while most people in the country, maybe 90, 95% completed the original vaccine series, only 35% or so of those over 65 got the new booster.
So people don’t want to take it, that’s fine, but I think it’s strange that Florida’s governor is now recommending that the vaccine manufacturers get investigated for fraud and conspiracy and held accountable for false statements.  Florida, by the age of its population, is the oldest in the United States, behind Maine.  And so undermining confidence in mRNA vaccines right now seems like a really odd position to take.
All I can say is I remember as a kid that I watched the moon landing in 1969.  I was seven years old, but still around one in ten or two in ten Americans don’t believe the moon landing was real.  People do surveys every year, and somewhere between one and two and ten Americans believe that it was faked.  So I’m not surprised to learn that a large number of people just don’t believe or trust the CDC data, but I do and I have vaccinated myself accordingly.  So that’s the end of the outlook podcast.  We’re having a webcast in a couple of days; feel free to dial in.  I hope to see many of you in person this year, bye.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.It’s a great time to consider putting capital to work. You can adopt the classic 60/40 portfolio by repositioning your holdings.Stewart Edginton, Head of EMEA Managed Solutions
As the new year unfolds, it’s a good time to re-examine how your portfolio is positioned, especially after one of the worst years for investors in recent memory. Fixed income is now poised to provide you with an income stream, a hedge against recession and a potential safe haven when equity holdings are volatile.
Fixed income yields today have moved significantly higher since April 2022. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield is now around 3.5%, reflecting higher interest rates. Compare that with last year’s starting level of 1.5%; the low starting rate contributed to bonds having the worst returns since the 1970s.
In the wake of last year’s steep equity declines, lower valuations make stock prices more attractive.After a year of market turmoil, we think the core principles of multi-asset investing (e.g., diversification) will re-emerge: A 60/40 portfolio can form the bedrock of your investments, while alternatives can continue to offer the opportunity for alpha (manager selection skill) in a variety of market environments, as well as the potential for inflation protection.
So where are we seeing potential opportunities in fixed income today? Let’s take a look at different scenarios that may match different portfolio circumstances, and consider the appropriate fixed income strategy for you.
Which types of fixed income may benefit
?
We like
core
fixed income, represented by the Global Aggregate Bond Index, a broad mix of investment grade (IG) bonds issued by governments and corporations. IG bonds are high quality, with strong credit ratings. They’re also reasonably long-term: close to seven years in maturity, on average.
Slowing growth or recession is likely to hit corporate earnings and equities, but would benefit core fixed income, making the asset class an excellent natural portfolio hedge. We like longer-term core bonds for their potential to rise in value: If future interest rates expectations start to fall because central banks look likely to achieve their inflation-fighting goals, bonds with higher yields locked in for years become more valuable (their prices rise). Their duration magnifies returns, adding a capital return on top of yield income.What about high yield (HY) corporate bonds for yield? Unlike core fixed income, HY is a risk asset, so it doesn’t offer the potential recession protection or a portfolio hedge against equity declines. And at current yields (450 basis points over Treasuries at writing time), we don’t think investors are getting paid enough for that risk.
Two ways to tap into what bonds can offer
So with bonds paying more and with their potential to appreciate—where do we see potential fixed income opportunities? Two types of investors should pay especially close attention to the case for fixed income:
If you’re overweight cash, short-dated bonds can help raise your returns
If you have more cash than you need for your short- and medium-term needs, consider investing that cash by adding shorter-dated bonds to your portfolio mix for their higher yields over deposit rates. We believe the current environment presents an opportunity to tap into these high yields, and by locking in the higher rates, you can reduce the reinvestment risk of rolling deposits.
For example,
European investment grade yields recently yielded around 4.5%. We are not expecting defaults within short-dated investment grade bonds, so there is a high certainty of capital return. Given that we think it is unlikely the European Central Bank (ECB) will hike rates above 4%, these bonds offer yield enhancement versus cash. So by extending maturity to 2–3 years, these shorter-dated bonds provide certainty of return and reduce the risk investors in rolling deposits face: That when it comes time to roll over and reinvest, your rates may fall later in the year. Locking in today’s attractive rates may not last..
If you’re underweight fixed income, rebalancing back to 60/40 can help restore your hedge
If you’re a multi-asset investor whose portfolio has tipped away from the traditional 60/40 allocation (meaning you have any level of fixed income under 40%), or if your bonds are short maturity, we think it makes sense to rebalance back toward that. This can help improve portfolio yield and may offer the “free protection” that fixed income can offer, when compared with other hedging methods.
It is the protection value of bonds that we find attractive because that characteristic makes staying invested over the long term likelier, making it easier to ride out volatility while compounding returns.
What if the Federal Reserve and other central banks keep raising rates this year, and bond prices fall? Would rebalancing now still make sense? We think so. Yields have surged so much the past year that the higher starting yield will act as a “buffer,” offsetting price declines, should rates and/or spreads move higher.
Conclusion: Taking a fresh look at the 60/40
The current market environment makes our outlook for portfolio allocation clear: The 60/40 has endured the test of time and is worth revisiting, given current market conditions. The traditional portfolio and the benefits of fixed income could make sense for your portfolio, particularly as risks to growth from central bank policy have increased—for the income stream, hedge against recession and the potential ballast when equity holdings may be volatile.

Our Top Market Takeaways for December 16, 2022.
Market update
Broke Record
Markets look set to close the year the way they spent most of it: volatile, fixated on central banks, and worried about a recession.
Even though the data released this week more or less confirmed that inflation in the United States is past its peak, Chair Powell and the rest of the Federal Open Market Committee stuck to the inflation-fighting script at their December meeting.
“We will stay the course,” Powell said, “until the job is done.”
At the European Central Bank meeting on Thursday, Christine Lagarde was even more forceful. Her comments strongly suggested that the ECB intends to raise rates aggressively through next spring despite the clear risks to economic growth in the region.
It seems like the central bank script hasn’t changed because there does still seem to be an imbalance in the labor market, and average hourly earnings are rising at a pace that isn’t consistent with 2% price inflation.
But the latest U.S. CPI data show a shrinking number of upside inflation drivers, especially when you consider that the official shelter price data are likely lagging actual conditions by a significant degree.
When inflation is high and sticky, strong talk from central bankers gets taken seriously by markets. But when interest rates are already slowing down growth, and actual inflation is running at a pace that is consistent with targets, markets can start to sniff out the end of the tightening cycle.The bond market, for example, doesn’t seem to believe the Federal Reserve will raise rates to over 5% like it says it will. Two-year bond yields are below the federal funds rate. Historically, this is a sign that investors think hiking cycles are over. The hawkish talk didn’t move longer-term rates either. Ten-year bond yields are at their lowest level since September.
Even though stock markets had a shaky end to the week, they are still well above the lows from October.
In our outlook, we argued that the real economy will have to deal with the consequences of 2022’s rate hiking cycle, but markets are likely to find their footing. Despite the equity market volatility, the broad reaction to this week’s central bank meetings seem to support that view.

Our Top Market Takeaways for January 6, 2022.
Market Update
New year, same vibe
It may be a new year, but U.S. financial markets still have the same vibe. This week, the S&P 500 oscillated within the same range it has been in since the middle of December. It moved up on hints that inflation is receding, and down on data points that suggest a stubbornly strong labor market. Under the surface, sectors that do better when economic growth is strong (e.g., financials, industrials and materials) have done well, while mega-cap technology and energy stocks have lagged.
Outside the United States, the vibes do seem to be shifting. In December, China rapidly removed many COVID restrictions. Markets are excited. Chinese stocks have rallied 50% from the late October lows, with the latest 10% coming in just the first few trading days of 2023. Post-COVID normalization should provide a boost to the Chinese (and global) economy through 2023.
European markets are likewise off to a relatively strong start, gaining over 3% in as many days. This continues a run of impressive performance. Over the last six months, Eurozone equities are up 15%. The S&P 500 is flat over the same period. Despite the cost-of-living crisis driven by the war in Ukraine and the resulting food and energy shortages, economic activity has been better than anticipated, and the warm winter has alleviated the natural gas shortages. In fact, natural gas prices are back down to where they started in 2022.Heading into this year, many feared that the three major economic blocks of the United States, Europe and China would all be dealing with stagnant to recessionary economic growth. While recession risk looms in the United States, reopening in China and a rapid improvement in European energy supplies have seemingly removed the worst-case scenarios for those two regions.
Spotlight
What could surprise us in 2023
In December, we released our
outlook for 2023
. There, you can find why we believe that even as growth weakens throughout 2023, markets will probably have a better year than they did in 2022. We also discuss how we are managing portfolios through continued turbulence, and where we think investors can find opportunity.
But what might surprise? Here are three scenarios we think are realistic, but which aren’t part of our base case.
1. Do you believe in miracles? China and Europe will materially outperform.
China’s surprise reopening after three years of stringent COVID containment policies will not only provide a tailwind to domestic Chinese economic growth, but also to many global companies that are also exposed to spending by Chinese households. Luxury players (such as LVMH) and travel (such as Hilton) are two areas that immediately come to mind. There are also signs that the onerous regulatory environment that deflated public company valuations is starting to shift. In December, U.S. authorities announced they will have full access to audits of Chinese companies that trade on U.S. exchanges. This removes the risk that those companies would have to de-list, which has been a clear overhang.
Europe, meanwhile, now has a surplus of natural gas after a keen focus on building storage in the fall, the rapid construction of LNG import facilities in Germany, and a very mild winter. China is the third-largest source of revenue for European companies, so economic reopening should provide an earnings tailwind. Finally, the end of negative interest rate policy in the region should encourage capital that fled due to paltry yields to return, and could help boost European bank earnings. A weaker dollar provides another tailwind for U.S.-based investors in assets outside the United States. Oh, and one of our least favorite market segments, mega-cap tech, is much less represented in European indices.
In 2023, Chinese and European assets could outperform their U.S. peers to the tune of 15%–20%.
2. Forget a hard landing or soft landing. We won’t have any landing at all in 2023.
Many outlooks
we have seen expect equity markets to have a tough first half of 2023, as they anticipate a U.S. recession (a hard landing) by the second half of the year. Those that are more sanguine believe the Federal Reserve can stop hiking rates because price inflation and the labor market will settle in a much more balanced place without too much economic damage (a soft landing). But there is a case to be made for no landing at all.
Despite headlines that big tech firms are planning to reduce their workforces, the broad labor market has shown no signs of weakness. Initial jobless claims are still remarkably stable at very low levels, and survey data suggests that most of those who have been fired from tech jobs have been finding new work relatively quickly. The quits rate, which is a good indicator of how comfortable workers feel about their prospects for finding a new job, actually rose last month.This strength in the labor market comes at a time when price inflation is falling. This means that real income for workers is rising, which could support more spending, which would encourage companies to continue hiring. Of course, this would keep upward pressure on wages, and would incentivize the Fed to keep hiking rates through the balance of the year.
In 2023, we may not see the end of the tightening cycle for the Fed or a recession in the United States.
3. Wall Street: Don’t call it a comeback.
The industries that felt the impacts of higher rates most acutely last year were finance and real estate. Initial public offerings, high yield debt issuance, mergers and acquisitions, mortgage applications and home sales all collapsed at their fastest rate since the Global Financial Crisis. Of course, the Fed is probably to blame. Higher financing costs are meant to slow down activity, but the rate of change in interest rates also had a material impact. Businesses, bankers and prospective homeowners all paused to see where the ceiling on interest rates was before borrowing and dealmaking.
Even though rates will remain at a higher level in 2023, their stability will help spur more activity in interest-rate-sensitive sectors. Take mortgage rates for example: Over the last five years, they have been about ~180 basis points (bps) above the 10-year Treasury rate. Last year, they were ~270 bps above the 10-year Treasury rate. As rate volatility comes down, so too should mortgage rates, which could breathe some life into the housing market.
As for the rest of Wall Street, there are deals that need to get done. The technology, media and telecom space needs to restructure after a painful year. Could Alphabet spin off YouTube? What is the long-term plan that Disney has for Hulu and ESPN? Could a Hulu/Peacock merger and spinoff make sense? Why does Amazon have a retail and a cloud computing business under the same roof? Warren Buffett always seems to be looking for a deal. Could a company like Textron, which makes Cessna airplanes and E-Z-Go golf carts, make sense? Peloton still has a loyal following and a large user base. Could a large company like Nike or Apple use it as a catalyst to build out a connected fitness platform?
In 2023, lower volatility in markets could lead to a recovery in mortgage activity, M&A, and IPO and debt issuance.

Originally Published December 14, 2022 updated on April 23, 2023
Revisiting Latin America’s Outlook for 2023 - Update after the first quarter of 2023
A full quarter of the year has gone by since we first published our economic outlook for Latin America for 2023. As such, the time seems now right to reassess our initial macro forecasts and adjust them as called for by ever-changing, idiosyncratic, regional, and global factors, including the likely economic consequences of China’s reopening and the financial implications of recent banking crises on both sides of the Atlantic, that may have impacted them for better or for worse. In this note, we do just that, focusing on four key dynamic indicators—growth, inflation, interest rates, and currencies—that best capture the current state and near-term prospects of the Latin America economy amid today’s volatile and uncertain times.
Key takeaways
Latin America’s near-term growth outlook has not changed much, but there are fine country-specific nuances that set them apart
Inflation is already moderating, but it may prove to be stickier than previously expected
While interest rate cuts are in the horizon, they will probably stay high longer than anticipated
Recent appreciation of regional currencies may soon run out of runway, forcing a reversal of fortune
Growth outlook has stayed virtually unchanged, but the regional average masks significant variations across countries.
A confluence of both positive factors, such as the favorable impact of the China reopening, and negative factors, such as the recent financial stress in the US and Europe, have largely offset one another and caused Latin America’s regional growth outlook for 2023 to remain virtually unchanged over the past three months. However, the country mix has experienced some meaningful revisions. Whereas Argentina, which continues to struggle with an epic drought, triple-digit inflation, a collapsing currency, political infighting, and its inability to contain fiscal deficits, is now expected to contract much more than first projected, Chile, where the government has moved toward moderation and political risks have receded, is now poised to shrink less than initially feared. At the other end of the economic growth spectrum, while Brazil, which has proven much more resilient than expected, and Colombia, where early-year activity has surprised to the upside, are set to expand more than anticipated, Peru, where activity was severely hit by social unrest early in the year, is likely to grow a tad less than originally estimated. Apart from Mexico, no other LA6
1
country is likely to reach its medium-term growth potential this year, and only Chile and Peru will probably do so next year, but just barely.
1
LA6 is a grouping of the six largest Latin American economies and includes Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Chile, and Peru, in size order.Inflation will continue to progressively ease, but not as fast as first expected.
As Latin American economic growth decelerates considerably this year, with tight monetary conditions and softer global growth constraining domestic activity, regional inflation has pivoted to a declining trend. However, the speed of the downward shift may not be as intense as first thought, as resilient core inflation prints and relatively elevated inflation expectations will likely lead to a relatively gradual, rather than sharp, decrease in inflation. The outcome of this scenario will probably be higher-than-first-expected inflation readings in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Peru for 2023, with our earlier forecast for Chile holding steady, and consumer prices in Mexico rising a tad slower than we estimated three months ago. Although regional disinflation will progressively gain momentum, annual prints will probably not return to target ranges until the latter part of 2024, in the case of Brazil, Chile, and Mexico, or even beyond next year, in the case of Colombia and Peru. Argentina, where price increases have reached untenable levels, is the only LA6 country without a proper inflation targeting scheme, and there is no sign that one will be adopted anytime soon.Despite some expected cuts, interest rates will probably stay high longer than anticipated.
Thanks to an early and aggressive response to rising consumer prices the world over, the LA6 countries have been relatively successful containing inflationary pressures. As inflation continues to moderate going forward, interest rates will likely be lowered into yearend, but probably not as fast as desired given stickier than expected inflation. While a decline in commodity prices eased pressure on monetary policy in the first two-and-a-half months of the year, commodity prices have steadily climbed since mid-March, and they (particularly oil prices) may continue their recent ascent in the near term. This could, at least in part, keep inflation, and hence interest rates, somewhat elevated this year, in most cases reaching levels higher than those we estimated three months ago.Currencies are poised to depreciate into yearend, though in most cases not as much as once thought.
Despite the fact that all LA6 currencies, with the notable exception of the Argentine peso, have appreciated in nominal terms against the U.S. dollar so far this year, they are likely to change course and depreciate against the greenback in the remainder of the year as domestic monetary policies become more accommodative amid a moderation in inflation and political uncertainty remains elevated in the region. However, the degree of nominal depreciation of Latin American currencies this year may not be as acute as once thought, as, much like Latin American central banks, the Federal Reserve may also lower interest rates in the US late in the year if a recession breaks out as expected, limiting the narrowing of the interest rate differentials between the US and individual LatAm countries.Conclusion
While Latin America’s growth outlook for 2023 may not have changed all that much from three months ago, a close look at the region reveals that there are important differences in the growth prospects of the region’s largest countries. Some of them are expected to contract more than before (Argentina), but others less (Chile). Meanwhile, some countries are poised to grow more than previously expected (Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico), but other less (Peru). The same can be said about inflation, which despite being projected to be somewhat higher than we thought before, some countries, like Mexico, are poised to deliver better results than we previously assumed. Stickier inflation will force central banks to keep interest rates relatively high for longer, but with some rate cuts likely on the way, Latin American currencies will probably have to give some of their recent gains back, though some (Colombia and Chile) more than others (Brazil and Peru). Overall, the Latin American economic outlook remains challenging, but not hopeless, as there are signs of resilience that should safeguard the region from the worst of the global slowdown that seems to be taking form.Latin America Outlook 2023 as of December 14, 2022
We expect 2023 to be a year of consolidation, with the most anticipated recession in history hitting the US by the second half of the year. However, even as the global growth outlook deteriorates, not all regions will fall equally
From a macro perspective, LatAm growth surprised to the upside in 2022, despite high inflation and central banks in tightening mode for most of the year. Pretty much across asset classes, LatAm outperformed other regions, both in EM and DM. While the macro outlook should deteriorate, the region can continue to be a (relative) bright spot for investors, as we noted in
our global 2023 outlook
.
On one end, growth is expected to slow significantly. This would be welcome news from an inflationary standpoint, yet inflation will remain above most Central Banks´ comfort zones, until well into 2024. Furthermore, there is risk of fiscal deterioration driven by political and social pressures as growth fails recover to pre-pandemic levels and social inequality becomes even deeper.
Despite the bleak outlook depicted above, LatAm stands out from across EM as major Central Banks in the region should start to ease monetary policy and thus softening the blow to growth stemming from a global slowdown. Furthermore, supportive commodity prices could also offset some of the impact, as China´s economy reopens post COVID lockdowns. Structural shifts such as nearshoring should also support FDI and hence help keep current accounts in check.
With a focus on the six largest LatAm countries (LA6)—Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Chile, and Peru— in this document we leverage our
Global Outlook 2023: See the potential
and take stock of the region’s economic and political prospects for 2023, as well as of investment opportunities that it may offer in some key asset classes.
Our highest conviction recommendations remain traditional fixed income and capitalizing on dislocations from a valuation angle through gaining exposure to US small & mid caps and defensive sectors such as healthcare, with alternatives adding diversification benefits to portfolios. The US remains our preferred region given its more defensive profile, yet as the cycle progresses, EM will pick up relevance and LatAm should be key part of those conversations.
Given relatively high real rates, FX in the region should be (relatively) better positioned to outperform in an environment of weaker USD. On the credit side, LatAm corporates are better suited to manage a global recession than most US HY issuers, yet we continue to favor DM IG given depressed valuations for the latter. Finally, on the equity side, the advent of the USD peak could drive flows into EM as growth differentials widen. Given current valuation multiples and relative macro fundamentals, we believe Brazil and Mexico could capitalize on the move.
Key takeaways
LatAm economic growth is poised to slow considerably, dragging inflation down in 2023 despite it remaining above official targets until 2024.
Interest rates are apt to peak in early 2023, yet stay in low double digits through the end of the year.
Fiscal deterioration is in the cards for 2023 amid lower economic growth, increased social spending, political pressure, and higher borrowing costs.
Nearshoring and commodity exposure, coupled with attractive valuations across asset classes, should remain supportive of LatAm financial assets.
Macro
After experiencing a deep contraction in 2020 prompted by the pandemic and ensuing economic crisis, Latin America recovered in 2021 and early 2022 underpinned by a more supportive external backdrop. But global winds are now shifting, and they seem to be shifting fast. Amid persistent inflation, tightening global financial conditions, and rising financing costs, the world economy is quickly weakening, commodity prices are softening, and capital flows to emerging markets are slowing. The combination of these factors will make for a challenging 2023 for LatAm, with growth expected to decelerate substantially and print well below potential.
Growth is set to decelerate to a crawl
Although recent developments in LatAm have been greatly impacted by two global shocks, the pandemic and the war in Ukraine, a third development, the tightening of financial conditions, is now increasingly shaping the region’s near-term outlook. Following a sharp 6.6% contraction in 2020 as the world suffered from the worst effects of the pandemic, LatAm’s economy rebounded strongly in 2021, boosted by the global recovery and a surge in commodity prices, and grew 6.6%.By early 2022, expansionary policies, supply-chain bottlenecks, and the war in Ukraine caused inflation to spike, forcing central banks to contain them by aggressively hiking interest rates. As global monetary and financial conditions tighten and global activity cools, LatAm growth is expected to slow to 3.5% in 2022 and to a meager 0.7% in 2023, below the region’s estimated growth potential of 1.7%.Inflation will be halved, but from a high base
The swift response of LatAm central banks, which began to hike domestic interest rates much earlier than other regions, to surging inflation has helped most of them to contain rising price pressures and to keep long-term inflation expectations relatively well anchored. Except for Argentina, where consumer prices continue to rapidly increase, it is estimated that inflation has already peaked in the rest of the LA6 countries and will gradually recede going forward.Our latest forecast calls for LatAm inflation to close 2023 at 4.1%, roughly half the 8.1% projected for 2022, as economic growth decelerates, commodity prices soften, global food and energy prices moderate, and statistical effects turn supportive. While lowering inflation to more manageable levels would undoubtedly be a momentous achievement—after all, falling inflation should boost consumption and hence growth—in no case is an LA6 country expected to meet its official inflation target at least until 2024. Accordingly, the key challenge for regional monetary authorities will be to withstand political pressure to ease monetary conditions—i.e., lower interest rates—much too soon, particularly as a decline in inflation that is substantial, but not sufficient, may encourage central banks to pause their tightening efforts.Interest rates are likely to peak in early 2023, but remain relatively high
Shortly after inflation started to rear its ugly head in 2021, and earlier than in other regions, LatAm central banks began to hike interest rates to contain undue consumer price pressures. Although the agility and intensity with which monetary conditions were tightened has helped to contain inflation, the struggle in the region is by no means over. Only two of the LA6 countries, Mexico and Peru, have managed to maintain inflation in the high single digits at its peak, with three others, Brazil, Colombia, and Chile, keeping it from breaking the 15% mark, and Argentina, the exception on many fronts, likely to see it climb to triple digits by early 2023.Against a backdrop of stubbornly high and more persistent than anticipated inflation, the hiking cycle, which has taken average nominal interest rates to nearly 12% in LatAm, more than 400bp higher than in EMEA EM and more than 800bp higher than in EM Asia, is likely to peak in 1Q23, and decrease only slowly to close next year just north of 10%. Only two LA6 countries, Chile and Peru, are apt to cut rates materially (~400bp each) in 2023, with the other four keeping then in double digits through the end of next year.Key fiscal deficits are poised to widen, as financial costs stay elevated
The LatAm regional fiscal deficit widened significantly to 9.1% of GDP in 2020 as governments sought to shield their economies from the severe impact of the pandemic and the crisis it produced. Although meaningful consolidation took place as growth rebounded sharply in 2021, with the deficit coming in at 4.2% of GDP, further progress at closing the fiscal gap was rather marginal in 2022, and the deficit is estimated to have only declined to 4.1% of GDP.As growth decelerates markedly adversely impacting fiscal revenues and the various leftist governments seek to deliver on their promises to increase social spending, the regional LatAm deficit is projected to widen to 5.9% of GDP in 2023, with Brazil and Colombia, both of which are aiming to implement tax reforms, expected to print the largest shortfalls. Given elevated financing costs from high interest rates, means putting public debt on a firm downward path in the near term will be no easy feat.
Current account deficits should narrow slightly, in part owing to nearshoring
While lower commodity prices and softer global growth will negatively impact LatAm’s exports, weaker demand for imports amid lower domestic growth should help the region print a slight overall improvement in its external balances. LatAm’s current account deficit (CAD) is estimated to have risen from 1.6% of GDP in 2021 to 2.2% in 2022, but a sizable reduction in the shortfalls of both Chile and Peru should compensate for an increase in Mexico’s deficit to keep the regional tally unchanged at 2.2% in 2023. No LA6 country is expected to register a current account surplus next year. Among the LA6, the smallest CAD will be recorded by Argentina, at 0.6% of GDP, and the largest by Colombia, at 5.0% of GDP.One of the global trends that could help LatAm improve its external balances going forward by increasing the region’s exports and integrating it further into U.S. and global supply chains is nearshoring. Defined as the practice of transferring a business operation to a country
that is less expensive and geographically closer, nearshoring
to LatAm has increased significantly over recent years, as geopolitical tensions and growing costs associated with manufacturing in distant countries like China have made the region increasingly attractive not only to U.S. companies, but also to European firms. According to recent estimates by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), nearshoring could increase LatAm’s total exports by $78 billion per year ($64 billion in goods plus $14 billion in services) in the near and medium term. While Mexico would see the biggest gains by far, all LatAm countries are expected to benefit from nearshoring. This, however, is much more of a long-term trend which should develop in the next decade or more.Political pink tide to take center stage
The October 2022 election of Lula as Brazil’s next president put an end to a busy electoral cycle in Latin America that started in early 2021 amid pandemic-induced economic strains. By January 1, 2023, when Lula is set to be sworn in, the six largest and most financially-integrated LatAm economies (LA6)—Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, and Peru, in that order—which together account for nearly 80% of regional GDP, will be led by left-leaning governments. By most accounts, the leftward shift, which has been dubbed the rebirth of a political pink tide in the region, has not been the result of an ideological realignment in favor of statist policies, but rather the product of voter discontent with the handling of the pandemic and ensuing economic crisis by incumbent right-wing governments. Put different, the success of the left in recent elections has been largely the result of a rise in anti-incumbency sentiment in LatAm and not clear support for leftist policies.
Recent elections have made evident that the pandemic has generally deepened, rather than reduced, political tensions and divisions in LatAm, increasing uncertainty and raising concerns about future economic policy direction. Meanwhile, from a market standpoint, the biggest risk associated with the ongoing regional swing to the left of the political spectrum is that it could prompt changes to the laws, regulations, or contracts governing investments in a way that adversely impact their financial returns.
The only LA6 country scheduled to hold a presidential election in 2023 is Argentina, but not until late in the year, with a controversial libertarian economist boasting a strong showing in recent polls and, in some cases, even outpacing his mainstream rivals. The next major general election will be in Mexico, but not until mid-2024.Country risks in focus
Although a worsening external environment will undoubtedly cloud LatAm’s regional outlook in the near-term, each country’s prospects and risks will also be driven by idiosyncratic factors. In Argentina, for example, strengthening macro stability, containing elevated inflation, reducing policy uncertainty, and complying with the country’s IMF program will be key challenges. Meanwhile, in Brazil, tight financial conditions are likely to weigh on already soft growth at a time when a weak fiscal stance is expected to be relaxed even further as the new government prioritizes social spending. In Chile, growth is projected to moderate significantly from a low base as the authorities recalibrate monetary and fiscal policies and the possibility of social discontent remains a concerning risk, leading the economy to contract the most in 2023 among all LA6 countries.
Apart from high levels of political risk and policy uncertainty, Colombia’s twin fiscal and current account deficit remains a key source of concern, with growth projected to cool meaningfully as interest rates are kept high to contain the second highest inflation (after Argentina) in the LA6 space. While Mexico’s fiscal policy, a vital source of concern for many other countries in the region, is widely expected to remain prudent, the economy is poised to slow in tandem with the US, the destination of nearly 80% of its exports. Finally, though Peru’s fiscal and external buffers remain relatively large compared to most others in the region, its balance of risks is skewed to the downside owing to soaring political uncertainty.
Credit
Corporations in LatAm are better suited to manage global recession than most US HY issuers as they have lower leverage, hold strong cash buffers which limits their need for market access and are accustomed to cutting capital expenditures in a haste.
However, having behaved as if they were issuers of reserve currencies during the pandemic, the Sovereigns are now in a tough situation. Fiscal risk remains relatively unanchored at a time when inflation is peaking, and monetary policy must remain tight to offset fiscal policy. In a flashback to the 1980s the region is regressing to unorthodox fiscal policy which runs the risk of turning into fiscal dominance of monetary policy, further exacerbating currency depreciation and inflation dynamics.
Given this setup, we like corporate bonds of exporters with balance sheets and cash flow generators geared to benefit from a weaker currency within LatAm corporates. We do see a sustainable environment where the currencies will depreciate in spits and spats providing inherent operating leverage to exporters as the fixed costs and variable costs in local currency gets diluted and their topline holds with its hard currency basis.
Commodities are essentially back in vogue as years of underinvestment have led to basically matched supply and demand and marginal growth drives real price appreciation. This serves to support the “exporter’s” thesis as well as the local currency depreciation dynamics.
On a relative valuation, LatAm Corporates and Sovereigns remain expensive to Developed Market Investment Grade bonds particularly on the advent of a potential recession. Our bias is to continue to move up in quality preparing for next year.FX
Recent LatAm FX performance has been mixed
Since LatAm currencies typically strengthen when the US cuts rates and weaken when the US hikes them, and the Fed has been in hiking mode since last March, several key LatAm currencies—including those of Argentina, Colombia, and Chile—have depreciated against the USD so far in 2022. A notable exception to this trend has been Brazil, which started hiking rates much earlier and more aggressively than the US, widening rate differentials in its favor.LatAm currencies are apt to weaken in 2023
As most LatAm countries reach peak rates by early 2023 and shift to an easing mode to stimulate their cooling economies amid a global slowdown, and the US keeps interest rates relatively high well into next year, LatAm currencies are likely to gradually weaken by end-2023. In fact, there is not a single LatAm currency among the largest economies that is expected to appreciate against the USD in 2023.That said, the degree of depreciation of LatAm currencies will likely be highly uneven, with the currencies of Argentina and Colombia bearing the brunt of the regional decline, while others, like the currencies of Mexico, Peru, Chile, and Brazil, projected to depreciate only slightly.
A quick word on the recent USD strength
Long-term trends in FX are heavily influenced by interest rate differentials. With U.S. rates exceeding those of other key DM countries, the USD has outperformed its DM peers in 2022.This trend may change in 2023, however, as the Fed pivots from its current ultra-hawkish policy stance. This would limit, though not prevent, the depreciation of LatAm currencies, some of which seem better suited than other currencies in EM to weather a difficult global environment.Equity
2022 Lookback
Despite global headwinds and political noise, LatAm equities significantly outperformed the rest of the world and EM in 2022, as of the time of writing. In fact, out of the main regions within EM, LatAm was the only one to post a positive return. Country-by-country, Chile and Peru made it into the top 5 performing countries in spots 2 and 3 and 5 respectively, while Brazil stood in the 6th place and Mexico in the 11th spot.
LatAm’s outperformance comes despite headwinds from higher US rates, a strong USD, idiosyncratic political risks, and persistent high inflation, among other factors. We attribute the region’s equity resilience to a high exposure to commodities, which are still the best performing asset class YTD, as well as cheap valuations and strong growth tailwinds supporting robust companies’ earnings growth. Growth prospects for Mexico and Brazil were consistently revised up this year, despite lingering fears of a Central Bank – driven recession.
2023 Key Drivers and What to Expect
Next year’s political calendar for the region will be significantly lighter than what it was in 2022, with the presidential election in Argentina taking the spotlight 4Q23. This means that main drivers for LatAm equities into the new year should be restricted to (1) foreign investor flow (i.e., global risk appetite), (2) idiosyncratic growth dynamics flowing through to earnings growth estimates, (3) lower rates as tailwinds for valuations that are too cheap to ignore.
Dynamics within the region will vary widely. Valuations across the region are unsustainably low, yet for Chile, Colombia, and Peru, given their markets’ low liquidity, we struggle to find catalysts to reverse the valuation discount. On the other hand, outlook for Brazilian equities seems like a coin toss at this stage. On one end, the BCB is expected to cut rates as soon as mid-year 2023, without impacting the BRL given high real rates. Domestic activity has been well supported and should remain so into 2023. However, fears about fiscal recklessness from the incoming government presided by Lula will cast a shadow keeping valuations below their historical average, especially for SOEs. On the other extreme, valuations in Mexico are also broadly attractive yet growth could be challenged by a recession in the US (our base case scenario). However, we see greater room for re-rating as international appetite reverts to EM as USD weakens and growth differentials across EMs vs. DMs narrow.Values represent real GDP growth estimates for 2022 and forecasts for 2023 and 2024 as well as estimated medium-term real GDP growth potentials.Values represent annual inflation estimates for 2022 and forecasts for 2023 and 2024 as well as annual inflation targets for inflation-targeting countries.Values represent actual quarterly monetary policy rate levels for 1Q23 and forecasts for 2Q23, 3Q23, and 4Q23.Values represent actual quarterly exchange rate levels (local currency per USD) for 1Q23 and forecasts for 2Q23, 3Q23, and 4Q23.This chart shows Latin America’s Real GDP percent change, on a year-over-year basis, from 2015 until 2021, as well as forecasts for 2022, 2023, and 2024.This table shows real GDP percent change, on a year-over-year basis, for Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and LatAm as a whole, for 2021, as well as forecasts for 2022, 2023, 2024, and potential GDP growth.This chart shows Latin America’s inflation percent change, on a year-over-year basis, from Q1 2021 until Q3 2022, as well as forecasts from Q4 2022 until Q4 2024.This table shows inflation percent change, on a year-over-year basis, for Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and inflation targets as a whole, for 2021, as well as forecasts for 2022, 2023, 2024, and potential targetThis graph shows LatAm’s reference rate, on a monthly basis, from November 2022 until December 2023.This table shows policy forecasts for Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and LatAm as a whole, on a quarterly basis, from December 2022 until December 2023.This graph shows LatAm’s fiscal deficit from 2018 until 2021, as well as forecasts for 2022 and 2023.This table shows current account balances as a percent of GDP for Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and LatAm as a whole, from 2020 to 2021, as well as forecasts for 2022 and 2023.This graph shows the potential annual increase in goods exports due to nearshoring, in USD billions, for Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Chile, Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, and Peru.This table shows the election calendar, for 2023 and 2024, for Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, and Brazil.This graph shows valuation on spreads and yields for Emerging Markets (EMBI and CEMBI) as of November 2022.

This week, another hot print of CPI in the U.S. took center stage. On the back of the release on Wednesday, Fed funds futures moved to imply a high chance of a 100 bps hike at the next FOMC meeting at the end of this month. The two-year U.S. treasury yield moved higher by 5 bps on rising rate hike expectations, while in the long end, the 10-year yield spiked 10bps initially but gave up most of it before closing 5bps lower as the market weighed recession risks. As a result, the U.S. treasury curve is more inverted, and the 2s10s moved to the most inverted level since 2000. In fact, markets are now suggesting that short rates will fall by ~80 bps in 2023. In other words, the markets think that 2022s aggressive tightening will quickly become easing in 2023.
U.S. equities opened with steep losses, but recovered throughout the day and the S&P 500 ended up losing ~45 bps. Under the surface, growth stocks outperformed. The ARKK ETF gained over 4% after an initial selloff, semiconductors gained ~75 bps, and consumer discretionary was the best performing sector in the S&P 500. It is hard to give a clean explanation on why equities did not suffer more. Perhaps markets have anticipated a bad inflation print, and now that the view was confirmed, that at the very least reduced some uncertainty.
While we see signs that inflation is in the process of peaking (more details in the second section), we’d note that the range of possible outcomes seems wide. Under this circumstance, we feel more confident to add core duration here as a downside protection. In addition, as risk assets have done a lot to price in recession risks, we are getting closer to the levels where equities become attractive again, but not there yet.Strategy question: U.S. inflation at 9.1%, what now?
The June CPI report out of the U.S. showed that prices rose 9.1% relative to last year and 1.3% relative to last month. Both figures were well above Wall Street consensus estimates, and likely ensure that the Federal Reserve raises rates aggressively at their meeting late this month. In today’s note, we break down the CPI report, and lay out how it impacts our macro outlook and market views.Taking a closer look at the CPI report, food and energy prices drove an outsized share of the print, as expected. That said, the pressure is broad-based. While core CPI (excluding food and energy prices) is rolling over on a year-on-year basis, prices are still up 0.7% from May. The vast majority of sub components either stayed elevated or accelerated – rents continued to surprise higher, healthcare services continued to accelerate, and durable goods categories like motor vehicles and furniture remained elevated.
It leads to several implications on how we see the economy and market evolve from here:
1. Recession risks move higher.
Inflation is too high and it is staying too high for too long. The priority of the Federal Reserve at the moment is to fight against entrenchment risk, which is the fear that inflation becomes self-fulfilling. When people see prices continuously going up for a period of time, they may expect it to continue and start hoarding, and that’s when higher expectations of inflation feeds on itself. That would put the Fed’s credibility in maintaining price stability at risk. In other words, this release will likely cause another aggressive move from the Federal Reserve, which may cause financial conditions to tighten even more quickly. The market is now pricing a toss-up between a 75bps and 100bps hike in the July FOMC. Given that the U.S. economy is already in the middle of a slowdown – as suggested by a range of leading indicators – more restrictive conditions will likely result in a higher chance that the economy slips into recession around year-end. That said, as we mentioned in
a previous note
, if we fall into a recession, it’s more likely to be a mild one than a crisis.2. We still don’t see runaway inflation from here
. We see multiple signs suggesting that inflation is in the process of peaking. Wage growth, a key inflation component and cause for a “wage-price spiral”, cooled to 4.2% in June from 6% at the end of last year, which is roughly in line with the 3.5-4% bracket that would be consistent with the Fed’s 2% inflation target. Commodity prices also declined since mid-June, which should translate into lower food and energy prices in the coming months. Wholesale gasoline prices in the U.S. are already down 15% so far in July, and retail gasoline prices have declined every day for the last 30 days. Other market-based measures of inflation have collapsed, for instance – the one-year breakevens are down to 3.5% from highs of over 6% in late March.We feel more confident about our investment advices
. In our Mid-year Outlook titled “Finding Shelter from the Storm”, we highlighted that positioning entering the 2H should be focused on adding to core fixed income as a portfolio ballast, preparing portfolios for structurally higher inflation with commodities and real assets, as well as opportunities in the private equity space for long term alpha. These approaches have been deemed effective in the midst of high uncertainty regarding inflation and growth trajectories, and will likely continue to protect investors from elevated volatility. In addition, some pockets of opportunity in risk assets are starting to emerge as markets have corrected a lot to price in growth concerns. Broad equity markets may not have found the bottom, but in 12 month’s time stocks are more likely to be higher than lower. And with high volatility, structured products are our favored way to enter the market.All market and economic data as of July 14, 2022 and sourced from Bloomberg Finance L.P. and FactSet unless otherwise stated.

Recession fears seem to have surpassed inflation concerns to become the primary market driver over the past weeks. This week’s risk-off movement was highlighted by a selloff in commodities. Having been one of the best performing asset classes this year, commodities’ year-to-date gains narrowed from a peak of nearly 40% in mid-June to just over 10%. The correction was led by the more cyclical categories in commodities, such as natural gas, oil and base metals. WTI crude sank below $100/barrel for the first time since early May, giving up most of the gains emanating from the Ukraine crisis. Concerns of demand destruction and more-than-expected Russian oil in the market have been the main drivers. That said, given the stagnation in new supply, we still expect commodity prices to be supported in the medium term – and we believe it makes sense to keep a strategic allocation to commodities in portfolios as a hedge against structurally higher inflation in the coming years.
Other parts of the market also demonstrate clear risk-off sentiment. 10-year U.S. Treasury yields are now 50bps lower than the highs in the lead-up to the June FOMC meeting. The 2s10s inverted for the third time this year, which is seen as an indication that a recession is imminent. The S&P 500 continued to be volatile, while we saw a turnaround in tech stocks supported by lower yields. We will discuss the recession risks in more detail in the second part of the note, but the bottom line is that whether a recession is around the corner or not, we will likely see a meaningful global growth slowdown and investors should be considering moving up in quality and adding to core fixed income.
Strategy question: The U.S. equity market had its worst 1H, so what’s next?
Over the first half of 2022, investor positioning in U.S. equities has deteriorated markedly as significant declines in January, February, May and June overwhelm a good March and a flat April. Having corrected 20.6% in 1H, the S&P 500 only had two years in the last 30 that recorded a worse performance: 2002 (-23.8%) and 2008 (-37.6%). Today’s note aims to address some of the key questions on investors’ minds: What’s already in the price? What’s next from here? Is there a “hold-your-nose-and-buy” level that we see?
What’s in the price?
The S&P 500 is now pricing in a meaningful slowdown in economic growth.
According to our model, the current drawdown implies that U.S. manufacturing PMI will contract to a ~46 level. It suggests that a significant growth downturn is in the price just short of a recession. Over the last five recessions, the manufacturing PMI bottomed at around the 38 level; and during the recession periods officially defined by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), the indicator averaged around 43.Over the last 70 years, the U.S. has had 12 recessions. If we remove the COVID recession due to its rapidness and event-driven nature, the prior 11 recessions caused a median stock market decline of 24%, with an average decline of 30%. From this perspective,
the market is pricing in a recession at an ~80% probability.
It is important to note that the decline year-to-date can be fully attributed to valuation compression. Negative revisions of earnings are not yet on the table. Historically, valuations usually contract well before any true degradation in earnings in the lead-up to a recession by at least six months. It usually takes 12 months from market peak to the recession trough for both price and valuations to bottom, while earnings growth tends to decline at the onset of a recession and continue after the recession ends.What’s next?
The equity market is increasingly driven by recession fears.
The window for a soft landing of the U.S. economy is closing
– and the growth outlook is dwindling quickly on the back of tighter financial conditions. Absent a recession, we rarely see financial conditions tighten this much in a six-month period. The June PMI report has suggested that new manufacturing orders and employment have started to contract. While the labor market is still tight, we are starting to see small layoffs in the real estate, construction and technology sectors, which have been challenged by high interest rates and wealth destruction. However, the Fed is unlikely to do anything about it until realized inflation starts coming down. We expect inflation to sequentially ease, in line with market consensus. However, if realized inflation doesn’t come down convincingly in the next few months – allowing the Fed to support its employment/growth mandate (over its inflation mandate) – a macro recession is likely to follow by year end. Based on this outlook, we increase our next 12-month US recession probabilities to 40-45%.
That said, if we fall into a macro recession, it’s more likely to be a mild one than a crisis.
The two main reasons being:
The balance sheets of both households and non-financial corporates appear to be in solid shape, lowering the risk of forced deleveraging. Households have spent the better part of the last 15 years de-levering, with the household liability to disposable income ratio at 30 percentage points lower than 2007 levels. Meanwhile, corporations took advantage of low rates to lock in low funding costs, and interest coverage ratios are near multi-decade highs.
Regulatory tightening among banks post-GFC
[1]
has pushed risk-taking outside of the banking sector. Banks, for the most part, have not provided credit to the more speculative markets (i.e. SPACs, cryptocurrencies, etc) and the share of credit provided by banks to the nonfinancial corporate sector has been falling since 2008. Consequently, the U.S. banking sector is currently well capitalized – and in fact even better capitalized than it was prior to the pandemic.
We expect that the earnings downgrade process will likely start over the next few months,
and that may be seen as a “good thing” by the market. As earnings revisions are occurring, inflationary pressures will likely ease, which may result in tightening expectations receding. This should help investors to look past earnings revisions (basically the inverse of what has happened year-to-date during which investors looked past positive revisions to future inflationary and monetary pressures).
What is a good level to buy?
Strategic, long-term investors should already see value in risk assets given how much negativity is in the price. On a sector level, we continue to see value in healthcare, industrials and reasonably priced technology. That said, if we go the route of a macro recession, we will likely see new index level lows.
Tactically, given elevated economic and equity price risks over the next few months,
we regard $3,500-3,600 on the S&P 500 as a reasonable level to enter the market
. It indicates another ~10% pullback from current levels or a 25-27% decline from the January high.
Our view of a “non-crisis” level recession is crucial to this view. With a mild macro recession, the peak-to-trough decline may not exceed historical averages. At $3,500-$3,600 on the S&P 500 we would be fully priced to the average historical recession. At that level, we estimate the forward P/E would be 14-15x or ~20% above the 12x average recession trough since 1957 (the premium accounts for the secular decline in interest rates over the last 40 years).
We would also highlight that with market volatility still well above normal, structured note pricings are highly enticing, giving investors protection well below our $3,500 reference level and attractive absolute return potential.[1]

Adam Ludman, Tax Advisory
Tom McGraw, Head of Tax Advisory
Jordan Sprechman, U.S. Wealth Advisory
President Biden has signed into law a $1.7 trillion “omnibus” bill that both funds the U.S. government through September 30, 2023 (the end of its fiscal year), and makes largely modest changes to rules governing retirement accounts.
1
Still, most taxpayers will be affected by the retirement account rule changes, a few of which are effective immediately (others will take effect in later years). Among the range of new benefits for different groups of taxpayers, there are several provisions that are available to high-earners.
2
Also notable is the fact that the more dramatic changes proposed in the last few years were NOT adopted.
However, one of the most interesting tax provisions directly affecting individuals has nothing to do with retirement accounts: It essentially shuts down the “syndicated conservation easement” business that has been a thorn in the Internal Revenue Service’s side for years. But it does not impact legitimate conservation easements.
Retirement account changes in effect now
For clients of the Private Bank, the most prominent of the changes to retirement accounts that are now in force include:
The Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) age has been increased from 72 years old to 73 for anyone born in the years 1951–59.
If you are turning 72 in 2023, you now have one more year before having to begin taking distributions from your defined contribution plan (e.g., 401(k), Individual Retirement Account (IRA), etc.).
Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) and Savings Incentive Plan Match for Employees (SIMPLE) IRAs can now be designated as Roth IRAs
—allowing contributions to these accounts to be made with after-tax income.
This is a significant change for those relatively few taxpayers in a position to make such contributions because the amounts that can be contributed to such accounts are significantly higher than those that can be contributed to traditional or Roth IRAs. For instance: The most a taxpayer under age 50 can contribute in 2023 to a traditional or Roth IRA is $6,500; to a SIMPLE IRA, $15,500; to a SEP IRA, up to $66,000.
Taxpayers who contribute after-tax income to SEP IRAs or SIMPLE IRAs are now able to take what may be sizeable distributions from those accounts in later years free of income tax.
Retirement plan participants can now elect to designate some (and perhaps all) of their employer’s matching contributions and non-elective contributions as taxable Roth contributions.
Previously, regardless of whether employees designated all of their own contributions to their 401(k)s as Roth contributions, employer contributions always had to be pre-tax.
Employees now can direct greater sums into Roth accounts, trading the necessity of paying income tax on assets in retirement accounts sooner for the ability to take greater tax-free distributions later
As the new law requires that the employer’s plan must allow employees to designate their contributions as being made to Roths, this provision likely will take some time to implement. Only employees who are fully vested in the contributions from the employer will be able to make this election.
Taxpayers are now permitted to make, on a one-time basis, up to $50,000 of qualified charitable distributions (QCDs) to charitable remainder trusts or charitable gift annuities.
Any taxpayer over the age of 70.5 with an IRA can take advantage of this provision. A QCD counts toward satisfying a taxpayer’s RMD.
Taxpayers also can now create SEP IRA plans for their households’ employees.
Doing so would offer a tax-advantaged way to provide competitive benefits to a house manager, nanny, housekeeper, etc., as the contribution limits for SEP IRAs are much higher than traditional or Roth IRAs, and are completely funded by the employer.
The law enhances the usability of qualifying longevity annuity contracts (QLACs) (i.e., deferred annuity contracts) purchased with IRA or defined contribution plan funds,
whose payments can commence as late as age 85.
Before payments from the contract start, QLACs are generally exempt from the RMD rules. Previously, IRS rules limited the amount that could be used to purchase a QLAC to the lesser of 25% of an individual’s account balance or $145,000. This provision repeals the 25% limit and allows up to $200,000 to be used to purchase a QLAC.
The penalty for failing to take an RMD on time (by December 31) is reduced from 50% to 25% or even 10%,
depending on circumstances. To be clear, even though there is a lower penalty, it is never advisable to miss an RMD.
Retirement account changes to come
Noteworthy changes to retirement account rules that will go into effect later include:
The IRA “catch-up” limit will be indexed to inflation, starting January 1, 2024.
Today, taxpayers ages 50 and older are able to contribute an extra $1,000, exactly, to their IRAs, for a total contribution limit of $7,500 instead of $6,500 for those under age 50. This provision will increase that $1,000 “catch-up” amount by inflation, in $100 increments.
The $100,000 QCD limit will be indexed to inflation, starting January 1, 2024.
Beneficiaries of “long-term” 529 accounts will be allowed to roll over up to $35,000 of an “overfunded” 529 account to a Roth IRA tax- and penalty-free, starting January 1, 2024.
The 529 account must have been open for at least 15 years and rollovers will be subject to the annual Roth contribution limit (currently $6,500 for those under age 50). This change likely means that rollovers would take place over several years.
Employees who earn more than $145,000 in wages will have to make their age-based catch-up contributions to Roth accounts, starting January 1, 2024.
This means employees over the age 50 who “max out” their 401(k) contributions will have to pay taxes today on any amounts allowed beyond the standard contribution.
Employees ages 60–63 will enjoy a higher “catch-up” contribution limit for 401(k), 403(b) and similar plans starting January 1, 2025.
The limit, now $7,500, will increase to around $11,250. If the worker earns more than $145,000 in wages, all of this catch-up amount would be treated as a Roth contribution.
S corporation owners will enjoy some key tax-advantaged provisions that now apply to individual owners of private C corporations with Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs), starting with S corporation stock sales after December 31, 2027.
S corporation owners will be able to defer gain from the sale of stock to an ESOP if sale proceeds are reinvested in Qualified Replacement Property (i.e., debt or equity of domestic operating companies), and the ESOP owns at least 30% of the outstanding stock after the sale.
This amendment allows up to 10% of the gain realized on the sale of S corporation stock to an ESOP to qualify for these gain deferral provisions.
The RMD age will be increased to 75, effective January 1, 2033.
This applies for all individuals born after 1959.
Bigger proposed changes to retirement rules did not happen
Over the last several years, several high-profile proposals related to retirement accounts were considered by Congress but not enacted. This latest bill did NOT include:
Limitations on the use of “back-door” Roth contributions (i.e., contributing to a traditional IRA and subsequently moving those monies into a Roth IRA).
Limitations on who can do Roth conversions.
Requirement of current distributions from Roth or traditional IRAs based simply on the account’s value (i.e., purging “mega IRAs”—those with assets over $10 million).
Restrictions on IRAs from owning privately held investments (e.g., private placement offerings).
Clarification on how “non-eligible designated beneficiaries” of inherited IRAs must apply the so-called 10-year rule when the decedent was already taking RMDs. That is to say: Are annual distributions required, or instead may the entire account be distributed on December 31 of year 10? The IRS is expected to issue guidance on this point in 2023.
Stronger restrictions severely curtailed syndicated conservation easements
Effective immediately, the omnibus law denies a charitable deduction, and expands penalties, for conveyances of syndicated partnership and other pass-through entity contributions of charitable easements on property values in excess of 2.5 times the taxpayer’s basis.
There are some exceptions, including one for family partnerships, and another for taxpayers’ contributions to partnership contributions at least three years prior to the conveyance.
Not adversely affected are individual taxpayers’ bona fide charitable contributions of easements that run in perpetuity, such as preserving non-commercial shore lines, or ranch or farm usage of land.
Virtually no other tax provisions directly affecting individual taxpayers are in the new law.
We can help
Check with your tax advisors, J.P. Morgan team and this Tax Hub for more information about how the new law might affect you and your family. But please keep in mind our advice that taxes should never be the primary driver of personal financial decisions; they should always be considered in the context of an individual’s overarching goals.

The law enacted on December 29, 2022, is formally known as the “Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023.” The section affecting retirement accounts has been dubbed SECURE Act 2.0 because it serves as a follow-up to the SECURE Act, a retirement bill enacted in 2019.
2
Several additional provisions were included in the law that would increase retirement savings opportunities for lower-income taxpayers, including permitting matching contributions on behalf of employees who are repaying student loans, requiring new retirement plans to include auto enrollment and auto escalation features, replacing the “Saver’s Credit” with the “Saver’s Match,” and creating in-plan emergency savings accounts, to name a few.Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.

This week, the Federal Reserve raised the policy rate by 75 bps in a unanimous decision. While the back-to-back 75 bps hikes are some of the most hawkish Federal Reserve actions since the Volcker years, markets took the event as a dovish surprise on the back of higher-than-expected June CPI. Equity markets rallied with the S&P 500 up 2.5% and the Nasdaq 100 up 3.8% on the day of announcement, while bond yields fell. This week was also the busiest week of the Q2 earnings season, with more than a third of S&P 500 companies reporting. The market got a boost from big tech releases – and though most of these companies reported a slower growth in revenue, their share prices climbed on low expectations. Nonetheless, we’re seeing more signs of a growth slowdown in companies’ forward guidance. Big retailer Walmart said it now expects its full-year earnings to decline by low double-digits as discretionary spending falls. Energy supply risks also continued to grow. European Natural Gas rose 9% to its highest level since March following the block’s agreement to cut gas use by 15% this winter.
On the data front, U.S. GDP contracted for a second quarter in Q2. Two consecutive quarters of negative growth is deemed by some as a technical recession, but it is not the definition used by economists or the U.S. government. You can have a recession without GDP contracting for two quarters, and GDP can fall for two quarters outside of a recession. The COVID recession in 2020 that lasted one month is a case in point. In this case we do not think the U.S. is in recession for a simple reason – the labor market is a better indicator than GDP (which tends to be revised) and the labor market was not in recession in Q2 (1.1 million jobs were added). A recession is unlikely outside of a broad layoff cycle and so far the labor market appears to be holding up. Nonetheless the data doesn’t paint a rosy picture – consumption was sluggish, businesses aren’t investing, and housing is slowing. Labor demand has clearly been slowing in recent months, so the labor market data will be crucial to watch in H2 for further signs of deterioration and the possible start of a recession.
Markets could remain range bound and volatile on light liquidity and fragile sentiment. We see risks as symmetric and likely driven by upcoming inflation prints – persistently high inflation could bring downside, whereas faster deceleration would likely be positive for markets.  We remain overall defensive on positioning. Within equities we prefer quality names within Healthcare, Industrials and Tech, and in the fixed income space we favor core bonds and stay cautious toward high yield.
Strategy Question: What are the key takeaways from the July FOMC?
During the July FOMC meeting, the Federal Reserve hiked the Fed funds rate to 2.25%-2.5%, which is considered a “neutral” stance of monetary policies. With the caveat that the short-term reaction to Fed meetings has often been fleeting, here are a few key takeaways from the event.
The Fed recognizes that growth is softening
. In the first paragraph of the policy statement the Fed updates us on what they saw in between meetings – and they acknowledge that “recent indicators of spending and production have softened”. The economic data that is weakening is easy to find. Housing data (including the pending home sales release this week) paint a consistent picture of a quickly cooling market. Further, both the flash composite and services PMI for the U.S. fell into contractionary territory this month. The bottom line: the economy is slowing quickly, and the Fed knows it.
Inflation is still the binding constraint.
The Fed is still committed to bringing realized inflation down. The first paragraph of Powell’s prepared remarks reiterated that the Fed has the tools to contain inflation and is willing to use them. He noted that the labor market was still too tight and that the Fed believes the economy needs a period of below-trend growth to help bring supply and demand into balance. Nothing new here, but the faster inflation falls, the better it is for the economy and markets.
The Fed may decelerate the pace of hiking from here.
Two ideas helped fuel the dovish fire yesterday. The first is that the Fed thinks they are close to “neutral”, or the theoretical interest rate that neither stimulates nor restricts economic activity. This is important given that a guiding principle of this tightening cycle has been getting to neutral as quickly as possible. Next, Powell said that it would probably be appropriate to slow the pace of rate increases once they get into restrictive territory. This is because the tightening already in place will probably continue to slow growth with a lag. Together, this means that it probably makes sense for the Fed to start hiking by 50 bps and 25 bps at a time, rather than the current 75 bps. To be clear, this isn’t really news to us. The tightening that is already in the system seems to be slowing the economy, and we don’t expect another 75 bps hike during this cycle. Still, the hint from Powell that a deceleration is coming had the effect of pushing bond yields lower and risk assets higher.4. …but future moves will stay data-dependent
. Chair Powell tried to tell markets that the Fed would be deciding on the next policy move on a meeting-by-meeting, data-dependent basis, and wouldn’t be as clear about policy intentions in the run-ups to meetings. Data from now until the next meeting in September will be very important. He did say that the Fed could hike by another 75 bps at the September meeting if the data deems it necessary, but it could also do more or less. Markets think that a 50 bps hike is the most likely in September (and we do too), but there is some chance of another 75 bps priced in as well.
5. Powell doesn’t think we are in a recession
. Powell downplayed the first quarter GDP report and said that he did not think the economy was in a recession. Like us, he pointed to labor market strength as a better signal of underlying demand in the economy. We agree. Regardless of yesterday’s -0.9% GDP print, we would argue that the economy is not currently in a recession. In fact, the labor market has added almost one million more jobs this year than it did in all of 2019, and credit card delinquencies are at all-time lows. Not exactly what you would expect to see during a recession.In all, the Fed is still focused on bending inflation back to target using rate hikes, which is in line with our views.
We expect a slower pace of hikes going forward, and our base case is that falling realized inflation and softening growth will likely enable the Fed to end the tightening cycle early in 2023.
Still, uncertainty is very high, and we will be watching the inflation, growth, and labor market data closely from now until the next Fed meeting in September and through the remainder of the year.All market and economic data as of July 28, 2022 and sourced from Bloomberg Finance L.P. and FactSet unless otherwise stated.

Index definition:
Standard and Poor’s 500 Index
is a capitalization-weighted index of 500 stocks. The index is designed to measure performance of the broad domestic economy through changes in the aggregate market value of 500 stocks representing all major industries. The index was developed with a base level of 10 for the 1941–43 base period.
The Nasdaq 100 Index
is a basket of the 100 largest, most actively traded U.S companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. The index includes companies from various industries except for the financial industry, like commercial and investment banks. These non-financial sectors include retail, biotechnology, industrial, technology, health care, and others.
Past performance is not a guarantee of future returns and investors may get back less than the amount invested. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.
• Callable / Putable Bonds - Callable Bonds have embedded call options which may be exercised by the Issuer, while Putable Bonds have embedded put options which may be exercised by the Investor. These events may result in early unscheduled return of principal on bonds. Investors should note that they may not able to reinvest the amounts received, into other suitable bonds with returns as favorable as that of the pre-existing bonds.
• Perpetual Bonds - Perpetual Bonds have no maturity date and pay a steady stream of interest rate forever. Thus these types of bonds usually have a particularly high duration and are very susceptible to fluctuations in interest rates as compared to normal bonds. Perpetual Bonds generally have lower liquidity and many different technical features. Investors need to exercise caution in dealing with Perpetual Bonds.
• High Yield Bonds - High Yield Bonds (with ratings at or below BB+/Ba1) carry higher risk since they are rated below investment grade, or could be unrated, which implies a higher risk of Issuer default. Further, the risk of rating downgrades is higher for High Yield Bonds in comparison to investment grade bonds.
• Convertible Bonds – Convertible Bonds give the bondholder an option to convert the notional of the bonds into common stock at a predetermined strike price. Hence, under certain circumstances, Convertible Bonds may have a risk profile that closely resembles that of common stock. Investors should note that they are subject to investment risks of both common stock and bonds.
• Contingent Capital / Convertible Bonds - Contingent Convertible Bonds have a contingent write down or loss absorption or conversion feature that allow the bonds to be written off, fully or partially, or converted to other type of assets on the occurrence of a trigger event. Hence, Investors holding Contingent Convertible Bonds are exposed to a higher Issuer credit risk in general and may lose the value of their investment substantially as a result of occurrence of the trigger event.
• Extendable Bonds – Extendable Bonds have extendable maturity dates and Investors would not have a definite schedule of principal repayment.
• Variable-Rate Bonds – Variable-Rate Bonds have variable and/or deferral of interest payment terms and Investors would face uncertainty over the amount and time of the interest payments to be received.
• Subordinated Bonds – Subordinated Bonds have subordinated ranking and in the event of liquidation or insolvency of the Issuer, Investors would only be entitled to be paid after other senior creditors are paid.Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.

Our Top Market Takeaways for January 13, 2022.
Market Update
The Climb
Stocks rallied and bonds saw gains on the heels of the latest U.S. inflation reading. Both headline and core (ex-food and energy) prices cooled in December for the sixth consecutive month.
Inflation prints have been a big driver of markets over the last year, with stocks popping on softer prints and sinking on hot prints. For instance, the S&P 500 saw a single-day rally over +5% in October, with one of the first signs of cooling prices, and fell more than -4% in August, when prices soared above expectations. These two days ended up being the best and worst days of 2022.
This time around, the S&P 500 gained
+0.3%
, nearing the 4,000 mark—unseen in a month—and the growthier NASDAQ 100 outpaced, up
+0.5%
. Broad international equities also continued their year-to-date climb on the prospect of China’s reopening story, coupled with a milder than expected winter in Europe. Even Bitcoin popped over
+7%.
U.S. Treasury yields slumped and prices rose as investors grew optimistic that the Federal Reserve was approaching the finale of the tightening cycle. We think this print seems to support a 25-basis-point rate hike at the Fed’s February meeting, with perhaps another hike in March before it takes a pause.
The effects of the hikes we’ve already seen continued to reveal themselves in the real economy this week. The latest: BlackRock announced it is letting go of 500 employees, or around 3% of its total workforce, given the “unprecedented market environment.” This news followed that of Coinbase, which plans to reduce its headcount by roughly 20%. It is worth noting, however, that layoffs have so far been contained within the rate-sensitive financial and tech sectors that likely overhired last year. U.S. Q4 2022 corporate earnings season also kicks off this morning, which will provide further insight into how businesses have been faring.
Now, back to the main event (and before Friday the 13th turns the story around for us):
Spotlight
Observations from the CPI report
Inflation fell as expected in December…that is uniformly good news.
We expect the downtrend to continue, but the question is just how much further inflation will fall. The answer will likely impact both central bank monetary policy and financial asset performance in the year ahead.
Here are our thoughts on the data and what it might mean for our view.
1. Inflation is trending in the right direction.
The latest CPI print showed that economy-wide prices fell by -0.1% in December. And while headline prices are 6.5% higher than one year ago, we have seen significant cooling from inflation’s peak level of 9.1% in June 2022. Weeding into the details, falling energy prices more than offset a rise in shelter prices (energy prices fell 4.5% in the month, while shelter prices rose by just 0.8%).
The core measure, stripping out food and energy, accelerated 0.3% on the month (versus +0.2% in November), but softened to a 5.7% pace (from 6.0% prior).
Overall, while inflation remains above the Fed’s mandate, the slowdown is encouraging, and sentiment surveys such as the ISM Prices Paid Index suggest lower levels of inflation ahead.2. Even shelter prices look set to decline.
Home prices have already begun to cool as higher mortgage rates have weighed on housing activity, and new asking prices for rental leases are moderating. While the shelter component of the CPI is likely to remain elevated for some time, signs suggest that even this component (which accounts for nearly a third of the CPI) should come down in the year ahead.3. Markets don’t believe the Fed.
The next Fed meeting is on February 1, and the central bank is widely expected to downshift from its last 50-basis-point rate hike to a 25-basis-point rate hike. Looking beyond the next meeting, the Fed continues to signal that it intends to keep rates higher for longer, but financial markets expect rate cuts by the end of 2023. While some financial pundits seem confused by the disconnect, we believe it makes sense. The Fed does not want financial conditions to loosen prematurely with inflation still well above target, so it needs to talk tough. Financial markets, on the other hand, are forward-looking and are attempting to forecast policy, not prescribe it.4. Things seem less miserable.
The Misery Index, which adds the inflation rate to the unemployment rate, has been gradually coming down since June 2022, as headline inflation has fallen by over two percentage points while the unemployment rate remains extremely low at 3.5%. Combined with the sudden reopening of China, this seems to be reviving some degree of investor optimism, with the S&P 500 having stealthily rallied over 10% since mid-October 2022. Leading U.S. economic indicators continue to validate our base case call of a recession in the United States later this year, but there is at least some chance that the economy remains resilient and experiences
“no landing” at all
.The bottom line:
The good news is that inflation data are trending in the right direction. The bad news is that the full impact of the Fed’s recent tightening cycle has yet to be felt. An eventual pause from the Fed will probably be seen as a positive catalyst for risk assets once it occurs, but it likely won’t negate the economic slowdown ahead. Investors should expect more market volatility in the first half of 2023, but we remain optimistic that market sentiment will improve in the back half of the year as investors price in an eventual economic recovery in 2024.
We think periods of relative market calm can be used by investors to review their portfolios.
Equities:
This could be a good time to reassess exposures and make sure that you have a proper balance between sector, style, size and geography, or to hedge exposures through options, structured notes or managed strategies.
Fixed income:
We still think high-quality parts of fixed income markets provide an attractive entry point, especially for those looking for a buffer against potentially adverse economic outcomes.
Borrowing:
We still think that over the medium-term, interest rates should head lower, but mortgage rates have come in, and there could be some opportunities to hedge other liabilities.
At the same time, we are always looking for opportunities across markets.
Small- and mid-cap equities, preferreds and dislocated market segments such as semiconductors are among our more tactical areas of focus. Investors could be well served thinking through ways to not just protect their portfolios in the event of recession, but also to position for the recovery that could come after.Standard and Poor’s 500

The U.S. misery index is an economic indicator that combines the unemployment rate and the inflation rate.
ISM Manufacturing Prices Paid is one of the diffuse indicators, based on which the Supply Management Institute calculates the Manufacturing PMI. It reflects a change in prices paid by industry representatives for the products or services they receive. The index calculation is based on data collected from a monthly survey of supply managers from 18 US industries. Respondents estimate prices paid in the production process: whether they have grown, fallen or have not changed. The collected data are processed and compiled to a diffuse index. The index weight in the total manufacturing PMI calculation is 20%.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Around the world, we’re seeing more and more donors collaborate, give while living and work to advance diversity, equity and inclusion.Three trends have been gaining momentum across the globe—giving while living, collaborating with other donors and advancing diversity, equity and inclusion.
Our work with donors from San Francisco to St. Louis to Singapore leads us to expect these trends to keep going strong in 2023, as more philanthropists adopt these strategies.
Might they inspire you to explore new ways of giving? See what you think.
Giving while living
Traditionally, donors made their largest contributions to charity in their wills and established private foundations or charitable trusts designed to exist in perpetuity.
Yet, in recent years, we have witnessed a shift: “Giving while living” has become a frequent theme in our conversations with clients at the private bank.
While most private foundations are still set up to be permanent, there are an increasing number of “spend-down” foundations. Indeed, a global survey of family philanthropies found that 32% had adopted a time-limited approach, with the majority seeking to spend the entirety of their foundations’ philanthropic assets in the next one to 15 years.
1
Reasons vary for accelerating giving during set time frames. Most often, we hear donors say they want to be personally involved and witness the change they seek. Many are motivated by the urgency of today’s challenges. Others want to avoid burdening future generations with interpreting their philanthropic plans.
As one client recently explained while sharing her intention to spend the entirety of her $2M donor-advised fund in the next 10 years: “My support is critical now.” Passionate about the environment and the arts, she wants to experience the joy of giving in her lifetime and make a difference sooner than later. In addition, her children have different interests, and she wants them to shape their own philanthropic plans and not feel obligated to carry out her intent.
Donor collaboration
Today, many donors are collaborating in an effort to amplify their impact and tackle complex issues and challenges.
This collaboration can take many forms, including donors pooling their resources or aligning their grantmaking plans to advance common goals. Working together, donors can maximize their impact and efficiency, source innovative funding opportunities, learn from peers and experts, and expand their network and try out different funding approaches while spreading the risk among collaborators.
Collaboration can be formally or informally structured. Giving circles, for instance, are a type of donor collaboration growing steadily, with more than 2,500 circles in the United States
2
. Giving circles are comprised of like-minded donors at all wealth levels, who pool funds and collectively decide where to give their pooled donation.
Some giving circles and donor collaboratives support communities in particular locations, for example to provide state- or city-focused COVID-19 relief funds. Others are designed to focus deeply on a specific issue or cause, such as early-childhood education.
Collaboratives can attract a valuable mix of partners who do not normally sit at the same table, including families and individuals, institutional foundations and corporate philanthropy.
For example, in 2015, JPMorgan Chase & Co and the W.K. Kellogg Foundation supported the Detroit Development Fund in launching a collaborative effort in Detroit to support entrepreneurs of color. Since then, the Entrepreneurs of Color Fund (EOCF) has grown to support entrepreneurs nationwide with hubs in nine major cities across the United States and more than 20 community development financial institutions participating. The initial funding attracted more than a dozen new partners and donors, which helped multiply the impact beyond the reach of any one of them.
Advancing diversity, equity and inclusion
Philanthropy has always played an important role in efforts to improve society’s diversity, equity and inclusion, as donors have long focused on helping groups that have been discriminated against, ignored and/or underserved.
Philanthropic support for racial equity, in particular, has increased in recent years. The number of funders supporting racial equity and justice in the United States grew fivefold in the last decade.
3
A 2020 survey of 236 U.S.-based foundations found that more than 80% were planning to institute changes designed to incorporate racial equity into their grant-making or program strategies.
4
Increasingly, donors are evaluating how their philanthropy might be more inclusive, reduce bias and promote equity. Many are examining how implicit biases might be affecting their grant making and how they might more effectively incorporate community perspectives into their decisions.
For example, young adult “third-generation” family members active in a multi-generational family foundation raised a concern that the foundation’s grant making did not reflect the equity and inclusion the family was seeking. With advice from advisors in the Philanthropy Centre at J.P. Morgan, the third generation presented options to their relatives for enhancing the foundation’s DEI efforts. Their ideas included:
Committing 25% of a family’s foundation funding to new, diverse organizations not previously supported
Training all family members in DEI principles
Establishing a process to include community leaders in the foundation’s grant selection
After a healthy discussion, the family members agreed to start by training all members in DEI principles and to learn about potential grantees not represented in past giving. The family will continue by assessing policies and practices at their foundation’s next board meeting.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Finding your answers to these deceptively simple questions could help.Are you fully prepared for the blessings and responsibilities that come with inherited wealth?
We find that it helps beneficiaries to make the most of the wealth their families provide if they ask—and find their own unique answers to—three deceptively simple questions: What do I need to know? What do I need to have? What do I need to do?
We offer this quick look at how beneficiaries might optimize their inherited wealth based on our two centuries’ worth of experience helping families that have significant fortunes.
What do I need to know?
A good first step is to make sure you have all the information you need. Some of it lies with others; some with you.
Discover the goals your family’s wealth creator(s) have for the funds you will steward. Can you speak openly with your elders about what they expect and what they value? What do they say, and what do their actions indicate? More insights might be gained from a family’s history and from learning how its wealth was built.
In addition, it is essential to understand the current and future resources available to you: amounts, timing and conditions placed upon the funds. If possible, you and your advisors should examine the wording of trusts and bequests of which you are (or will be) a beneficiary.
Then it would be wise to look within. Identify your own goals, and prioritize them honestly. To do so, we find it helps to envision what you want your life to look like in the near, medium and long terms.
For each goal, specify its:
Label (e.g
.
, buy a home, retire at a certain age, pay for children’s education)
Dollar amount (i.e.,
how much each goal will cost)
Timeline (e.g., you may want to buy a home in two years or pay for your children’s college education in 15 years)
Priority level—Where does each goal sit in your hierarchy of needs and wants? (e.g., perhaps you are open to buying a less expensive home so that you can retire earlier)
What do you need to have?
Plans and legal documents are essential.
Every adult should create, and keep updated, a thoughtful, long-term financial plan that will give them and their advisors insights into the decisions they will make over their lifetimes, including, for example, investment allocation, lending, estate planning and retirement planning. Knowing your goals and their priority levels will help you build that plan in which you:
Organize your resources and goals into “buckets,” depending on their timelines, priority levels and purposes. For example, you may have buckets for liquidity, lifestyle, legacy and perpetual growth. (For more of our insights into goals-based planning, see “
The bucket list: How to organize our money with intent
.”)
Examine the goals and resources in each bucket, then determine whether and how you will achieve those goals. Each bucket can have a specific investment allocation—the appropriate risk/return expectations, and investment products and strategies that are most aligned with the goals and resources in that bucket.
In addition: No matter your age, if you have or expect to receive wealth, you should have a core estate plan that reflects your intent for that wealth. It is not too early to put the right documents in place. You also should expect to update them whenever your life changes (e.g., if you get married, divorced or have a child).
It is also critical that you make sure you have the right beneficiary designations on retirement accounts, and that you do a thorough review with professionals about what types of insurance you might need.
What do I need to do?
At least once a year, it’s wise to re-evaluate your plan to make sure your resources and goals are aligned. Has anything changed to warrant a change to your plan? Are you paying attention to tax-efficient asset location (e.g., contributing to retirement plans and a health savings account)?
Also look ahead and plan for the future: Do you foresee any changes that might impact your finances? What experiences might you want to have? Do you anticipate changes in your lifestyle? What legacy do you want to leave for your descendants?
All of your financial life deserves your attention. Regularly reviewing banking transactions facilitates your awareness of your spending and allows you to check for fraudulent activity.
Ann answers the three questions
Because it’s sometimes helpful to see how advice plays out in someone else’s life, let’s take Ann, age 30, as an example. Ann is about to get married. She and her fiancé, John, want to buy a home. They plan to have children.
Ann’s parents own and run a successful business. They’ve made Ann the beneficiary of a trust for her and her descendants.
Ann spoke with her parents about the trust. It contains a standard clause that directs the trustee to disburse funds for the beneficiary’s “health, education, maintenance and support.”
Ann already knew her parents valued hard work, education and becoming a well-rounded person. In her conversations with them about the trust, Ann learned that they hoped she and her husband would support themselves with their own earnings and use the trust funds primarily to educate their children and successive generations.
Ann’s parents also revealed that any future gifts for Ann would be in trust. Their thinking: If Ann ever was to get divorced, her inheritance would not be part of any division of marital assets. With that knowledge, Ann and John can have an informed conversation about whether a pre-marital agreement is right for them.
Ann and John also discussed their current and future resources, and savings habits. Both of them contribute to their respective 401(k) accounts, but not to an IRA. Neither of them has any debt. The couple discussed the location, cost and timeline for the home they hope to buy. They were specific about lifestyle choices for the near term and for when they have children.
Working with their financial advisors, the couple prioritized their goals and developed a financial plan. They decided which accounts would be jointly or individually owned, agreed to maximize contributions to their 401(k) accounts and a health savings account, and also to begin contributing to IRAs, and agreed that they will thoughtfully structure debt on the purchase of their home. They also set a “savings goal”—the amount of their earnings that they will invest annually. Finally, they met with an attorney to execute a core estate plan.
Then, to make sure they will stay on track, they set up annual appointments with their financial advisors.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Selecting the right legal entity to organize your company can be critical to your success.The COVID-19 pandemic seems to have sparked a boom in the creation of small businesses in the United States.
1
Each year during the past two-and-a-half years, substantially more new businesses were formed than were formed annually in the preceding decade.
2
If you are one of the entrepreneurs now making a go of it, be warned:
How
you legally organize your enterprise can be critical to its ultimate success and your personal financial health.
Which of these six legal entities should your business be: sole proprietorship, general partnership, limited partnership, S corporation, C corporation or limited liability company (LLC)?
The choice you make affects (among other things) the taxes that the business and, ultimately, you will owe, your personal protection from any debts the business might incur and losses it might sustain as well. You can usually change the form later if necessary, but it’s usually simpler and, in the long run, less expensive to make the right choice at the time of formation.
Key pros and cons of the six most common U.S. business entities
Here are some of the most important features of each of the six types of business entities, starting with the simplest.
1. Sole proprietorship
Technically, a sole proprietorship isn’t a form of business entity at all. It is, literally, a non-entity. You simply start operating a business.
Pros: Because sole proprietorships tend to be simple and inexpensive to “create,” they are by far the most popular form of organization. In 2018, the Small Business Administration reported that 23 million small businesses (73% of the total) were sole proprietorships.
3
Cons: The disadvantages of doing business as a sole proprietor are significant when it comes to both personal liability and tax reporting. That’s because no line marks where the owner’s personal life ends and business life begins:
Liability—You are personally liable for any and all of the business’s debts and losses.
Taxes—All tax items (income, gains, deductions, losses, credits) are reportable on your individual income tax return. The fact that business and personal affairs are intermingled can make bookkeeping difficult (which items are personal and which belong to the business?), and can attract unwanted attention from the Internal Revenue Service. Taxing authorities pay particular attention to claimed deductions.
2. General partnership
If more than one individual starts a business, the simplest form of entity is a general partnership.
Pros: Usually, a written agreement is not needed (though generally advisable), and there tends to be no limit to the number of partners (though most general partnerships tend to be formed by pairs of siblings or good friends). Partners are usually free to agree on owning the partnership’s interests unequally.
Taxes for a general partnership are basically the same as they are for a sole proprietorship. A general partnership is a “pass-through” entity: It is disregarded for income tax purposes.
All tax items (income, deductions, etc.) flow through proportionally to the partners according to their ownership interests. No taxes are imposed on the partnership itself.
Cons: Each person in a general partnership is personally exposed to unlimited liability for all the partnership’s debts and other liabilities. That is to say: Get sued, and all of you are completely on the hook.
3. Limited partnership
Often, a would-be founder, needing capital to implement a new idea, solicits funds from investors who, in exchange for their investment, typically receive the lion’s share of the business’s ownership and profits.
Many investment partnerships, such as real estate, hedge and private equity funds, are organized as limited partnerships (LPs).
Pros: Like sole proprietorships and general partnerships, LPs are pass-through entities for income tax purposes. (On occasion, allocations of tax items, such as income and deductions, are not pro rata.) The limited partners are liable for the partnership’s debts and losses only to the extent of their respective investments in the partnership. This arrangement is generally considered fair, as the limited partners are passive investors, with no say over the day-to-day management of the business.
Cons: All LPs have at least one general partner, whose personal assets are subject to the debts of the entire partnership. An LP’s creation must be evidenced by a written agreement; therefore, LPs are costlier to organize than proprietorships and general partnerships. LPs also are usually subject to state-level fees and reporting requirements.
4. Subchapter S corporation
There are, for tax purposes, two types of corporations, each getting its name from an Internal Revenue Code subchapter that authorizes them. C corporations are separate, taxpaying entities, while S corporations generally are not burdened by taxes at the corporate level.
Owners of businesses with a relatively small number of shareholders often want to organize as an S corporation; but not all of them can.
Pros: All properly organized corporations tend to insulate their shareholders from personal liability for a corporation’s debts and losses.
The advantage of an S corporation is that, like a partnership, it is a disregarded entity for income tax purposes.
Cons: Complying with the relatively rigid rules required to preserve S corporation status can be difficult.  Certain entities, such as many types of trusts, cannot be shareholders. Unlike with a C corporation, S corporations can have only one class of stock (though it can have both voting and non-voting shares).  And if an S corporation election is inadvertently terminated (as sometimes happens), unpleasant tax ramifications often follow.
5. Subchapter C corporation
Pros: Many large business owners usually choose C corporation status to enable them to have an unlimited number of shareholders from around the world, multiple classes of stock (voting and non-voting), as well as ready access to public capital markets, from which they can raise money to expand operations.
Cons: Unique among business entities, income earned by a Subchapter C corporation is subject to “double taxation” (i.e., first, the corporation’s earnings are taxed, then shareholders pay tax on dividends they receive from net earnings). Also, the law discourages C corporations from accumulating earnings without any active trade or business use.
A potential partial remedy for this “con”: Recently, some long-term founding C corporation shareholders have been able to mitigate the double taxation by running the corporation in such a way that their ownership is considered “qualified small business stock” (QSBS). Owners of QSBS can generally avoid, on the sale of their shares, capital gains tax up to the greater of $10 million or 10 times their basis in the shares sold.
Whether your business even can, let alone should, be organized to take advantage of the QSBS tax break is a topic to be examined carefully with your tax advisors.
6. Limited liability company
Among our clients, the limited liability company (LLC) is perhaps the most common of all forms of business ownership—and it’s easy to see why.
Pros: An LLC is a highly flexible form of ownership that tends to offer the most attractive features of a partnership (no taxation at the entity level) and a corporation (liability for the entity’s losses is limited to the entity’s assets). An LLC can have one, or more than one, owner and may have the flexibility to determine how it is treated for tax purposes: as a disregarded entity; a partnership; or a corporation. Most choose not to be taxed as corporations.
Cons: As with an LP, forming an LLC requires paperwork. In the case of an LLC, not only must a certificate or organization be filed with a state, but also an operating agreement must be executed. Also, an LLC usually incurs annual filing fees and other administrative costs.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.It is a little-known fact that fraud and online scams are more likely to occur on Fridays and before holidays. In the lead-up to Lunar New Year 2023, we’ve prepared this quick guide to protecting yourself and your loved ones from online threats.
Given the increasingly digital bonds that tie us to friends and family due to the ongoing pandemic, it is particularly important to understand the right way of navigating your social media, your mobile phone and your email inbox.
We would like to take this opportunity to wish you a safe and prosperous start to the Year of the Rabbit!
1. Social engineering comes in many forms
Fraudsters can go to great lengths to deceive individuals into providing confidential or sensitive information via email (phishing), phone (vishing), or text message (SMiShing), by claiming to be a trusted associate or organization.
2. Digital red packets (or
hongbao
) are fun, but be careful
As a rule, it isn’t a good idea to accept or offer payments to people or contacts you don’t know. Don't believe anyone asking for money via online platforms, even if it’s your relatives and family members. Confirm their identity by a phone call or using other methods. Unfortunately, if you send a red packet to the wrong person, that transaction is not reversible (it is cash, rather than goods and services), so be careful.
3. QR codes are more powerful than you think
Some online shops (such as WeChat accounts selling goods online) might send you a QR code to pay for a product or receive a discount. Unfortunately, there is a growing prevalence of QR code scams, where a Trojan file (or virus) is installed on your mobile that may later steal your account name and password, or send it to a third party. Only use QR codes from trusted shops that have significant followers and positive reviews. You should also be wary about scanning QR codes in shopping centers or other public places.
4. Think before you ‘Like’
Some commercial online shops on social media platforms will ask you to give them a 'Like'. In order to send that ‘Like’, your mobile number and other details may be required through a sign-up form. Fraudsters have been known to use this as a means of collecting the maximum amount of information – and then suddenly the online shop you’re trying to ‘Like’ suddenly disappears. Your mobile number, social media account and other personal information can then be used to enable a range of fraudulent behaviour.
5. Consider adjusting the privacy settings within your social media platforms
While social media is certainly fun and increasingly convenient given the diversity of services, the default privacy settings are not the safest. It is a good idea to review your Privacy Settings and make adjustments according to your preferences.
6. Video calls and online events can be overly revealing
With large gatherings off the table given the continuing pandemic, many of us may be attending a virtual Lunar New Year event, or connecting via video with friends or colleagues. It is a good idea to familiarize yourself with the video conferencing platform’s security and privacy settings, and consider modifying your profile name. You may want to avoid revealing your full identity, particularly if attending a public video meeting.
You should also
avoid sharing too much by protecting personal information visually. Consider using a virtual background or review the objects your camera shows (can others see your diplomas, family photos, security systems, etc.).
7. Learn how to spot fake messages, emails and calls
Look for bad grammar, spelling errors and poor sentence structure. Note if the sender is trying to create a sense of urgency to pressure you to bypass controls (e.g., Payments must go out ASAP!). Before donating to a charity or crowdfunding site, research the organization to determine its legitimacy – and remember that it is very rare for charities or social movements to accept cryptocurrency. If an unknown caller or emailer is trying to take advantage of you – simply hang up the phone or delete the message. If you have deleted the message, be sure to empty the “trash” on your computer, phone and tablet.
8. Maintain good cyber hygiene
Use strong usernames and passwords, never share them with others, and change them frequently. Install and use anti-virus software, and avoid connecting to public WIFI networks. Ensure that sensitive information is kept in a secure place, and regularly monitor your email and social media outbox for irregular behaviour. It is also wise to regularly monitor your bank accounts and review transactions, or have a trusted person do this for you.
9. Finally - know how your bank behaves
J.P. Morgan will never
ask you to log in to the same computer with more than one user’s credentials, ask you to repeatedly submit login credentials, or contact you about online problems, such as logging in, if you haven’t contacted us first.

, Global Head of Multi-Asset and Portfolio Solutions
John Bilton, CFA, Head of Global Multi-Asset Strategy, Multi-Asset Solutions at J.P. Morgan Asset Management
2022 was a rough year for investors—there’s no getting around it. Stocks and bonds both suffered significant losses, leading to  one of the worst years ever for a balanced portfolio.
Although equity and bond prices have drifted higher in the first weeks of 2023, we think the bear market of 2022 has made it a great time to put capital to work. With higher yields, bonds can again provide a plausible source of income and a potential safe haven. At lower valuations, equities presently look attractive. We believe the combination of higher yields and lower equity multiples means that markets today may be offering the best potential long-term returns since 2010.
Back to Basics
, the title of the 27th annual edition of our Long-Term Capital Market Assumptions (LTCMAs), published in November 2022, captures our belief that after a year of turmoil, the core principles of investing still hold firm. Once again, the 60/40 (60% equities, 40% bonds) can form the bedrock of portfolios, while alternatives can continue to offer alpha (manager selection skill), inflation protection and diversification.
Our LTCMAs are the work of more than 90 experts from across J.P. Morgan Asset & Wealth Management. They scrutinize 200 major asset and strategy classes to forecast returns over a 10-to-15-year investment horizon. These annual forecasts drive our strategic asset allocation and power the tools we use to advise our clients.
Attractive entry point
Across most asset classes, our LTCMAs find, investors may be at the best entry point in over a decade.But keep in mind: Choosing an entry point is not about timing the market. Trying to predict a market top or bottom is generally a fool’s errand. But there are better and worse times to make an investment. We think entry points can be a key consideration when you design and revise your goals-based plan.
Fading cyclical headwinds
Some powerful forces brought us to this entry point.
Most important, unprecedented easy monetary policy (many years of negative policy rates and large central bank balance sheets) suddenly reversed. Central banks globally made a sharp policy pivot from supporting growth at all costs to depressing inflation at all costs.
That shift led to a bond market rout, with the worst returns for government bonds in more than 30 years. It also impacted otherwise resilient corporate revenues and earnings.
By any measure, the damage is severe. But here’s some good news. The portion of investment returns that is tied to the economic cycle (such as policy rates and valuations) swung from headwind to tailwind this year. That brightens the outlook for returns across asset classes, regions and sectors.
Below we present our return outlook for key asset classes. While the forecasts move significantly higher, the macroeconomic backdrop is little changed from last year. Our estimate of the trend in long-term economic growth comes in only a little below last year’s LTCMAs. And because we expect today’s inflationary surge to eventually subside, our inflation forecast moves only slightly higher.
Bonds normalize, yields soar
We turn first to bonds.
Central bank policy rates “normalized” swiftly over the past year. In other words, they moved into normal positive territory, away from abnormal negative rates. In our LTCMAs, real return (after inflation) forecasts for most government bonds are positive once again.For the first time since the global financial crisis, interest rates in most currencies have settled at or above the “cycle-neutral” rate—the rate that prevails on average over the long term, taking the ups and downs of market cycles into account. Higher interest rates mean that bond yields are now at or above cycle-neutral averages.
As a result, our bond return forecasts rise significantly. For U.S. 10-year bonds, the cycle-neutral yield forecast rises 20 basis points (bps), to 3.20%. Much higher starting yields push our return forecast up by 160 bps, to 4.00%.
Our outlook for corporate bonds (credit) improves as well. Return forecasts increase 270 bps, to 5.50%, for U.S. investment grade credit. They move up 290 bps, to 6.80%, for U.S. high yield bonds. 2022 was a brutal year for credit, but losses mainly reflect the jump in government bond yields.
Stocks valuations decline, projected returns rise
Our projected equity returns rise sharply. Our developed market equity forecast jumps 360 bps, to 8.40% (in USD), and the emerging market equity forecast increases 320 bps, to 10.10% (in USD).
A year ago, global equities were expensive. Today, we believe stocks are considerably more attractive, but crucially, the underlying businesses are largely in good shape. Valuations are now close to, or in some cases below, our estimates of fair value. Corporate profit margins look high, a potential headwind to near-term returns. But we think profitability may prove resilient over the long term.
Alternatives in a complete portfolio toolkit
Even as return forecasts for public stock and bond markets move higher in this year’s LTCMAs, alternatives can still offer benefits that cannot be easily found elsewhere. Chief among them: alpha, inflation protection and diversification.
In the financial alternatives space, our private equity
1
returns increase 180 bps, to 9.90%; hedge fund returns are up between 110 bps and 220 bps, depending on the strategy; and direct lending jumps 90 bps, to 7.80%.
Among real assets, higher interest rates push our forecasts down slightly. Core U.S. real estate declines 10 bps, to 5.70%. Global core infrastructure rises 20 bps, to 6.30%, and global core transportation increases 10 bps, to 7.50%.
Across all alternative sectors and strategies, we will likely see a wide range of returns, depending on the individual manager. That dispersion underscores the important of manager selection when investing in alternatives.
A shifting investment landscape
In both public and private markets, the investment landscape is shifting. We’re moving from a world of low inflation, easy monetary policy and low interest rates to one with more inflation risk, tightening policy and higher rates. That will create fresh opportunities—along with new risks to manage.
Yes, last year’s losses were painful. But looking ahead, we see the best environment in a decade for asset class returns, allowing you to refocus on your long-term goals with genuine cause for optimism.We can help
Our Long-Term Capital Market Assumptions find that markets today may offer a compelling entry point across asset classes. It’s a good time to build or revisit your goals-based plan to help ensure you are on track. Reach out to your J.P. Morgan team.

world, gaining the status of ""unicorns""

has seemingly become the be-all and end-all. The prospect of crossing the US$1 billion estimated valuation mark is a tantalising goal for firms and their investors alike. With the number of unicorns growing globally, many investors in Latin America—which to date has comparatively few unicorns—are speculating about which companies in the region could replicate these trends. Governments are also focused on the growth of the unicorn market as a key metric of success for Latin America’s development. However, the mythical figure of the unicorn is rather obscure. Is there a secret formula to spot or create a unicorn?
But focusing solely on companies that might achieve unicorn status is missing the point: There are significant investment opportunities in smaller ventures, which offer large potential returns in sectors including retail, financial services, healthcare and education. Outside of the major economies of Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Colombia, many Latin American startups may struggle to achieve unicorn status, owing to the small size of the region’s markets and still-developing internationalisation. But investors should not be dissuaded: Unicorn status is an arbitrary one, and dynamic smaller companies bringing new solutions to old problems offer significant investment potential — while also addressing some of the region’s critical development goals.
This article analyses the environment for private startups in key Latin American markets and explores how technology, an increased focus from governments, and private sector initiatives can support the sector and power economic growth. As has been the case elsewhere, the right mix of innovative products and a strong enabling environment coupled with a motivated investor base can transform Latin America’s challenges into a source of economic growth.
The market for unicorns
The number of unicorn companies around the world has grown sharply in recent years. With the term initially reflecting the rarity of such steep growth in a new company, data suggests that there are now over 770 unicorns globally, valued at US$2.4 trillion
3
. The onset of the coronavirus pandemic saw short-term fluctuations in the market, with investor caution leading to a global slow-down in the number of new companies that crossed the US$1 billion-valuation mark; but a rapid recovery has since followed (see Figure 1).Most unicorns are based in major markets like the United States, China and Western Europe. Just 23 of the identified global unicorns are located in Latin America (around 3% of the global total), with a combined market value of US$76.8 billion
4
. That said, the number of unicorns in the region doubled from 2020 to 2021, offering a glimpse of the dynamism in the broader startup market.An expansive lens to spot opportunity
A narrow focus on potential unicorns — an arbitrary classification — would obscure the wealth of investment opportunities in Latin American startups. There is a solid track record of rapid growth in mid-valuation startups, evidence of new innovative products and services from existing market players — as well as a region yearning for creative solutions to accelerate development goals.
The Inter-American Development Bank has identified over one thousand private technology startups across Latin America — a number that has more than tripled since 2016
5
. These companies are worth over US$200 billion and employ 245,000 people. Venture capital (VC) funding is growing in earlier funding rounds, indicating that investors seem to be growing in comfort and pursuing companies at an earlier stage of development.
Brazil and Mexico account for around 80% of the valuation of private startups in Latin America. But fast-growing markets can also be found elsewhere, including Colombia and Chile (see Figure 3).Investor interest in the private startup market is heavily concentrated in fintech and e-commerce, which represent three-quarters of the total ecosystem’s estimated value
6
, despite representing only 42% of the number of firms (see Figure 4).Figure 4. Latin American startups by sector

In terms of percentage of funds received, the Fintech sector is the most prominent (48.4%) followed by automotive (12.1%), clean energy (11.7%), e-commerce (10.3%), mobility (3.7%), health (2.6%), food and beverages (2.5%), real estate (2.3%), software / IT (1.7%), travel (1.5%), agtech (1.1%), logistics (0.7%), edtech (0.5% ), legaltech / insurtech (0.3%), entertainment (0.2%), biotech (0.1%), security / cybersecurity (0.1%), human resources (0.1%) and others (0.1%).Within Latin America, Brazil is a standout. It has been successful in fostering growth of high-value startups (it hosts 14 of the region's 22 unicorns, for example), and stands out when compared with similarly-sized economies like Indonesia (home to five unicorns)
8
. Importantly, Brazil’s market demonstrates the opportunity beyond the unicorns. The number of startups in Brazil that have raised more than $1 million in VC funding has quadrupled since 2016
9
. Brazil’s robust startup ecosystem is enabled by a large, young internet-savvy population that is highly urbanised. At the same time, global investors have been attracted to Brazil given the size of its local markets for goods and services and the government’s commitment to foster innovation. This combination of market size, demography and high levels of connectivity has well positioned Brazil as a fertile ground for VC-backed startups.
Critically for Latin America — the growth of private startups in the region has the potential to unleash positive economic spill-overs, as seen in some of the main innovation clusters around the world like the United States, India and China, where startups have driven new market opportunities and improved affordable access to key services including healthcare, financial services and education.
Fostering a vibrant startup ecosystem requires a coordinated effort between governments and the private sector to promote digital readiness and inclusiveness, as well as a harmonised policy, regulatory and economic enabling environment.
Startups and startup clusters often grow organically, offering related services to customers in the same sector (thus boosting competition), or launching new products in other sectors (fuelling innovation). However, developing vibrant tech ecosystems requires a longer-term vision and coordinated strategy.
Building a startup ecosystem from the bottom up
Whether it's a new firm hoping to secure large-scale capital injections, a government hoping to foster a more dynamic private sector, or an investor trying to stay ahead of the curve, there’s no single recipe of success. However, there are common foundations that support a dynamic startup environment. Unpacking the fundamentals of countries and sectors that have achieved success in fostering a vibrant startup market offers critical insight on opportunity.
Economist Impact has identified 19 indicators across four key areas that reflect the strength of a country’s enabling environment for startups, in order to support investor decision-making (see Figure 4).A rapid analysis on the enablers of Latin America’s startup ecosystems
Economist Impact has analysed seven Latin American markets (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico and Peru) according to the above 19 indicators, alongside four international countries for comparison (US and China — major startup market — and Indonesia and South Africa — similarly sized economies).
Digital readiness
Digital readiness is a critical enabler of the startup ecosystem, requiring investments ranging from infrastructure to cybersecurity. In Latin America, strengthening e-government services and cybersecurity are key opportunities. The COVID-19 pandemic made stark the importance of robust digital infrastructure. In countries where the financial sector or the government had previously invested in digital financial infrastructure, policymakers were able to use digital distribution channels to quickly disburse cash transfers and other supports to beneficiaries in need. In Brazil, for example, around 67 million individuals received at least one cash transfer starting in April 2020. By August, beneficiaries had used around 40% of the funds to make digital payments to utilities and businesses, and for the internet. This robust digital infrastructure signals a large opportunity.
However, cybersecurity is an area of concern for startups in the region and rightly so. According to the ITU’s Global Cybersecurity Index
10
, all seven countries analysed have significant room to strengthen protections and promote the growth of key markets including e-commerce.
Similarly, research and development (R&D) spending is another area of opportunity to foster a stronger startup ecosystem in Latin American countries, particularly in smaller Latin American markets. Peru’s R&D spending, for example, represents just 0.1% of its GDP, compared with 1.2% in Brazil, 2.1% in China and 2.8% in the United States.
Digital inclusiveness
The quality and inclusiveness of digital infrastructure is another important factor that is often left out of the conversation. The level of inclusiveness in Latin America presents a mixed picture. According to Economist Impact’s Inclusive Internet Index
11
, Costa Rica, Mexico and Argentina have the highest levels of internet usage of the Latin American countries in our sample, falling only slightly behind China. Strikingly, China, Mexico and Argentina are also the countries where people have the most favourable perceptions (e.g greater trust) of online privacy.
However, the quality of internet services, measured through a composite indicator that assesses broadband speed, latency and capacity, is weaker in Latin American countries than in global leaders like China and the United States, which may explain, in part, why the region has room for growth in tech-dependent startups.
Policy and regulation
A policy and regulatory environment that is conducive to investment in innovation must balance several short- and long-term priorities, including the need for regulation against creating space for innovation. The Global Microscope, an index by Economist Impact that assesses the enabling environment for financial inclusion, has identified the importance of regulatory “proportionality” —that is, regulation should be proportional to the risk to the financial system. It should also be proportional to the type or function of a product, meaning that a bank that lends all types of financial services and products, for example, will be regulated differently than an e-money wallet that can only be used for payments. A qualitative indicator measuring whether countries have a proportionate legal framework for emerging services like peer-to-peer lending and crowdfunding, suggests that Chile and Costa Rica are lagging behind when it comes to proportional regulation in the fintech sector.
Another leading practice in the regulation of innovation is harmonisation with international standards. Anti-money laundering (AML), consumer protection and data privacy policies and regulations are particularly important for a thriving startup market. This is an area where Latin American countries are relatively strong compared to some global peers, although Brazil and Costa Rica lag behind in AML regulation, according to Microscope data.
Macroeconomic conditions and the business environment
Lastly, investors should always take into account the overall country risk and business environment, which has direct impact on consumer demand and the viability of long-term investments. Here the regional picture is a mix of opportunity and uncertainty.
Brazil’s large economy is showing improved resilience to a “second wave” of COVID-19 infections, and is expected to recover sooner than expected to pre-crisis levels in 2021
12
.  Argentina continues to face economic volatility, currency pressures, and awaits an IMF package to help restore stability. Smaller markets are displaying promise – for example Costa Rica. Despite its small size, Costa Rica has one of Latin America’s most attractive business climates, according to Economist Impact's Business Environment Rankings, reflecting political stability, a skilled workforce, and low taxes.
Accelerators targeting startup growth
To complement efforts to improve the enabling environment, a range of governments across Latin America have launched programmes geared towards startups more broadly (incorporating SMEs as well as faster-growing firms). The Colombian government has sought to develop metropolitan areas as startup hubs, for example through its INNPulsa partnership with HubBog in Bogota and its Ruta N incubator in Medellin
13
. Chile has had a successful public accelerator programme for new startups in place for a decade, including a seed  investment division that offers a range of benefits (both financial and non-financial)
14
. Costa Rica also has programmes in place to stimulate innovation in areas such as cybersecurity
15
.
It is not just governments that are pursuing such efforts: Companies in the region are also taking a much more proactive stance to boost innovation. In early 2020, Grupo Bimbo, a Mexican multinational food company, launched two accelerator programmes—Eleva and BakeLab—which invite proposals from startups for new product ideas that have the potential to scale globally, either through investment from Grupo Bimbo or a commercial alliance
16
. AB InBev, a Brazilian brewing company, has also been active, launching the 100+ Accelerator in 2018, which aims to find startups with interesting and viable market solutions
17
. In the first two years of the programme, AB InBev scaled up 23 out of the 39 startups that enrolled, including firms in Argentina and Uruguay.
Much of the existing literature that looks at potential growth in startups in Latin America focuses heavily, if not exclusively, on fintech (unsurprisingly, given fintech firms represent about one-third of startups in the region). Innovative digital solutions offered by new fintech providers target a large, underserved area of the financial services market. There is additional potential given the thin penetration of traditional banking services in the region, which stands at less than 50% in most of Latin America, and is even lower in some, such as 40% in Mexico.
18
The rapid growth of this sector is now being met with new regulation. Mexico was one of the first countries to pass legislation to regulate fintech. Other countries, including Peru and Argentina, are likely to soon follow suit.
However, other sectors, such as education and healthcare, which are comparatively under-developed by international comparison, could also be poised for rapid growth. Successful startup propositions in Latin America often focus on providing localised solutions, which for Latin America often involve catering to sectors at the bottom of the pyramid in areas where public-sector provision has been weaker, including healthcare and education. By contrast, e-commerce was more developed prior to the onset of the pandemic — and has since only accelerated, with both new and existing firms alike growing their e-commerce offerings.
Conclusion: Chase business propositions, not investor buzz
Governments, investors and startups in Latin America have been seduced by the rise of unicorns across the world, which has influenced how investment opportunities in the region are assessed. Looking ahead, some new ventures will undoubtedly succeed in crossing the US$1bn valuation mark, probably in a greater variety of countries than the current limited number. An explosion of unicorns is unlikely in the region, since many countries remain constrained by small market size, a digital infrastructure that is growing only slowly, or a developing regulatory backdrop—and, in some cases, all three. To take this pessimistically, however, would overlook the larger picture: There are significant opportunities in smaller ventures, which offer large potential returns in sectors such as retail, financial services, healthcare and education – and importantly, can unlock economic growth and help the region achieve its development goals. Countries that have been proactive in fostering startups, mainly through reforms to improve the underlying business environment, are best-placed to benefit from future investment growth.This section contains the data and methodology underlying the rapid assessment of the key enablers of Latin America’s start-up ecosystem.
Definition of unicorns
Within this article, a ‘unicorn’ firm is defined as any private start-ups with an estimated market value of at least US$1 billion.
Framework for the rapid assessment of start-up ecosystem enablers
Based on desk research and expert input, The EIU has identified 18 indicators to support investor decision-making in Latin America. These 18 indicators span four broad categories:
Digital readiness
Digital inclusiveness
Policy and regulation
Macroeconomic conditions
Data from additional sources, defined below, were also utilized in this analysis.
Seven Latin American countries were assessed (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico and Peru), alongside four international countries for comparison: US and China (major start-up markets) as well as Indonesia and South Africa (similarly sized economies).
Data sources and definitions
All of the quantitative and qualitative data in this assessment were collected and analyzed by the EIU project team. Data were gathered from reputable international, national and industry sources, including the EIU’s proprietary databases. Key data sources include:
●        Crunchbase
●        International Telecommunications Union (ITU)
●        Gallup

Definitions of unicorns vary across sources. In this article we define unicorns as privately-held companies with an estimated valuation of $1 billion or more based on funding rounds. This is consistent with the definition used by CrunchBase, the primary data source on private funding markets used in this article. Companies that have migrated to public funding markets are excluded from this definition.

The growth of wealth does not come without risks. As industries evolve and change, some firms have adapted and thrived, while others have struggled to survive. These experiences, both positive and negative, may be magnified by the level of concentration an investor holds in a specific company. While one investor might experience the thrill of rapid wealth creation, another could confront the pain of wealth erosion.
In short, while concentrated stock positions can create substantial wealth, they also come with a high probability of dramatic losses that can potentially derail the financial future you envision for you and your family.
Michael Cembalest’s influential paper, The Agony & the Ecstasy (updated most recently in 2021), explored the risks and rewards of concentrated wealth for U.S. investors, presenting a range of diversification strategies that families can deploy. Building on this work, we broaden the scope to Europe. In this paper, we aim to quantify the risks of concentrated stock positions(through an example of the U.K. stock market), highlight several case studies of business failure in Europe, and examine strategies to manage concentrated portfolio risk.
Here are 3 key take aways from the paper:
1. How likely is it to invest in a “losing” company?
History suggests the risks are high. Taking the example of the U.K. stock market, just over 40% of all companies that were ever traded in the FTSE All-Share ex-Investment Trusts Index from January 1986 through October 2022 experienced a “catastrophic price loss,” where the stock declined 70% or more from peak levels and has not since recovered. Conversely, rarely can a stock come out on top—and then stay there. While the most successful companies generated massive wealth over the long run, only 11% of all stocks in the index since 1986 met the definition of “mega winners,” defined as outperforming the index by over 500%.Here’s another visualization. The winners have generated enormous excess returns, but the median stock has underperformed the FTSE All-Share ex-Investment Trusts Index.2. What causes a business to fail?
Hindsight is 20/20. The causes of most catastrophic losses may appear obvious after the fact. Yet, at the height of a company’s success, many involved—either direct participants such as management, boards of directors and employees, or external observers such as stock analysts and credit rating agencies—are lulled into believing the strong returns of the past will persist. But in most instances, the cause of business failure tends to be out of management’s control: government policy changes, regulation, commodity price risks, foreign competition, technological innovation, fraud or changes in consumer behavior.
In the paper, we dig into the dynamics at play for business failures in broader Europe over the last several decades—brought to life by potent company case studies.
3. How can an investor best manage a concentrated portfolio?
However a position is acquired, it leads to outsized, idiosyncratic risks when it represents a concentrated position in a portfolio. While the position may have created great wealth, it increases the probability of dramatic losses and reduces the certainty of financial plans. Many investment and wealth planning strategies are designed to help investors manage a concentrated position.
These strategies seek to allow the investor to de-risk, access capital from and/or diversify the position. Investors often select a combination of customized strategies to optimize for their investment views, personal financial goals, the transaction costs or market impacts, tax circumstances, as well as legal and regulatory implications.

Has the new year got you examining your life and wondering if it’s time to live somewhere new?
If you are thinking of moving, you’re not alone. Roughly 10% of Americans move every year. The average American moves approximately 12 times during his or her lifetime.
Moving usually means far more than just acclimating to, among other things, different neighbors, new work environments and altered routines. Long before you pack up your old home to head to a new one, we recommend paying close attention to the impact that changing locations might have on your family’s financial picture. Especially if you are changing locales in the United States, you’ll want to consider your new state’s taxes and the forms of ownership it recognizes, its laws regarding marital and non-marital relationships, and any other potential nuances.
Consider state taxes….
1
Clearly a new home state’s tax system can make a big difference to you, economically. Some of our clients think of moving from a high- to a low-income-tax state within the United States (e.g
.
, New York to Florida, California to Texas). Others investigate the practicality of moving from the continental United States to Puerto Rico, a jurisdiction favored by both the U.S. government and the Commonwealth itself with low tax rates for qualifying U.S. citizens for certain qualifying investments. Still others even entertain the idea of renouncing U.S. citizenship and moving to another country to escape U.S. taxes on most if not all of their future income and gains.
2
It’s clear why a tax move is attractive: State income tax rates vary widely among the 50 states.
3
The high for California residents of 13.3% is challenged only by the top tax rate of 14.776% paid by New York City residents with more than $25 million of income (10.9% by the state and 3.876% by the city). Meanwhile, residents of nine states (including Florida, Tennessee and Texas) pay 0% in state income taxes.
4
The greater ability to work remotely has complicated many people’s calculations. There remain unresolved questions about to what extent a state can levy income taxes on a person working remotely in one state for an employer based in another state. States have recently sued one another over their residents’ taxation by another state. At present, the litigated issue remains unresolved, with no clear precedent having developed in the courts.
Meanwhile, state transfer taxes are sometimes worth considering. At last count, 19 states have some form of estate and/or inheritance taxes. Connecticut is the only state with a gift tax.
Still, we find that most people do not in the end move for tax reasons alone—and we think that’s wise. As with investing, we always recommend that clients consider tax implications but not base their decisions solely on taxes.
If, however, you do decide there are enough reasons for you to move, we advise that you take great care on the state tax front. Your old state may continue to consider you a resident unless you can prove, by “clear and convincing evidence,” that you have not only physically departed, but also established a domicile in your new state.
Proof that you have truly established a domicile in a new state includes evidence of where you send your children to school, register your car, hang your “Rembrandt” and keep your pets. But that’s not all that’s required. So, if you’re going to move your home, do it right; ask your J.P. Morgan team for a
Changing Domicile Checklist
.
Look at how you own property
State laws differ in how they treat property ownership. Be careful: the specifics can have a significant impact on your finances.
Fourteen of the 50 states, including California and Texas, are “community property” states. In the community states, generally speaking, all property acquired during the marriage is considered to be owned equally by both spouses, regardless of titling.
5
So pay attention if you’re married and moving from a separate property to a community property state, or vice versa. At the least, your estate planning documents will need to be updated. At the worst, a divorce or death may result in unexpected consequences.
Also, mover beware: Not every state recognizes every form of ownership. For instance, not all states recognize “tenancy by the entirety.” Nor do all states recognize what other states might refer to as “payable on death” or “transfer on death” accounts. Moreover, states vary to some extent on, as an example, at what age a minor has full rights over assets held in a Uniform Transfers to Minors (UTMA) account.
States also offer varying degrees of protection from creditors for a homeowner’s principal residence. Florida, for example, has a “homestead exemption” that provides significant protection to the homeowner. By contrast, neither New Jersey nor Pennsylvania has homestead exemption laws.
Marital domicile matters
There is much to consider when married and moving. State law dictates how and when your estate is distributed upon divorce and death. The laws vary from state to state with respect to: the definition of marital versus non-marital property; how and when to value and divide property; and a surviving spouse’s rights to property at death. Some states are known as “equitable” distribution states;  the laws of others presume an equal division of property in the event of divorce. Some states recognize that premarital property and inheritances are separate, by law, but treat income earned on separate property during the marriage as marital property absent an enforceable prenuptial agreement that states otherwise. Additionally, laws regarding a spouse’s right to an inheritance  may differ depending on where you live at the time of your spouse’s death. If no provision has been made for a surviving spouse in a decedent’s will, the surviving spouse may be entitled only to an “elective share” (usually less than half), rather than the entirety of the decedent’s estate.
Take care that upon relocation you do not inadvertently enter into a “common law marriage.” In certain states, such as Colorado, “holding yourself out “as a married couple without ever having exchanged vows may result in certain legal rights to and claims against property belonging to both you and your common law spouse. In other words, a marriage license may not be required in order for your common law spouse to lay claim to your assets and income depending on where you live..
We can help—and see you there
Clearly, before you move, you’ll want to consult your tax advisors, estate planning lawyers and J.P. Morgan team about the potential financial impact of your new state—and you might do to adjust your financial life accordingly.

Blackburnpublished Date:- Jan 26, 2023Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.
Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.The rules governing the plans that help insiders transact in company stock are now final. Get the answers to the most common questions.In December 2022, the SEC adopted new amendments and requirements to finalize Rule 10b5-1, which governs prearranged trading plans used by company executives and other insiders
1
to provide an affirmative defense against insider trading liability.
2
The new rules include a “cooling-off period” and regulations for gifts of securities, among other new provisions.
Rule 10b5-1 plans permit insiders, such as board members, C-suite executives and others who might potentially possess material nonpublic information to buy or sell company stock without violating insider trading laws. These plans can be effective solutions for insiders who need to maintain ownership holding requirements or desire to partially divest out of their concentrated positions.
The amendments impose new requirements on insiders who implement Rule 10b5-1 plans, including:
A “cooling-off” period before trading can begin under a new, or in certain cases, modified Rule 10b5-1 plan;
A personal certification requirement;
Prohibition of multiple overlapping plans and a limit of only one single-trade plan within a 12-month period; and
Enhanced reporting requirements on Forms 4 and 5.
3
Here are answers to frequently asked questions on the new restrictions, disclosures and reporting requirements:
When do the new rules go into effect?
The final rules are effective February 27, 2023. Insiders are required to comply with the amendments to Forms 4 and 5 filed on or after April 1, 2023.
How do the new rules affect the Rule 10b5-1 plan I already have?
The amendments will not affect a Rule 10b5-1 plan in place before the effective date of the new rules. Legacy plans in place prior to February 27, 2023, will not need to be changed. However, if an existing plan is modified
after
the new rules are effective, the plan must then comply with the new requirements to ensure an affirmative defense against insider trading claims.
With the new cooling-off period, how long am I required to wait to trade?
It depends on whether you are a director, officer or other insider. The mandatory cooling-off period will range from 30 to 120 days before the first transaction may occur in a new or modified plan.
Directors and officers: The later of (i) 90 days after plan adoption or modification;
or
(ii) two business days following disclosure of the company’s financial results in a Form 10-K or 10-Q for the fiscal quarter in which the plan was adopted or modified. The maximum cooling-off period is 120 days after the plan adoption date.
Insiders other than directors, officers or issuers: 30-days after plan adoption or modification.
What do the new rules require I certify?
Directors and officers must personally certify and expressly include in a new or modified Rule 10b5-1 plan that they are:
“Not aware of any material nonpublic information about the security or issuer”
and
“Adopting the plan in good faith and not as part of a plan or scheme to evade the prohibitions of [Rule 10b5-1].”
In addition to the personal certification of good faith, the affirmative defense will only be available if an insider has “acted in good faith” throughout the duration of the plan.
Under the new rules, how many Rule 10b5-1 plans may I have in place at any given time?
In short, one. The new rules prohibit multiple, overlapping plans covering open market trades.
However, there are limited exceptions when multiple plans may be permitted:
The use of more than one broker-dealer or other agent to execute trades as part of a single Rule 10b5-1 plan.
When trades under a new Rule 10b5-1 plan do not begin until trades under a prior plan are complete or expire without execution.
A Rule 10b5-1 plan to execute a sell-to-cover transaction (e.g
.,
where the sale of securities is necessary to satisfy tax withholding obligations due to the vesting of compensatory awards).
Additionally, the new rules now limit insiders to one single-trade plan within a 12-month period.
What will I be required to report on Forms 4 and 5 when I buy, sell or gift my company stock?
Effective April 1, 2023, insiders will be required to indicate by checkbox whether a reported transaction was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c). If so, insiders will be required to disclose the adoption date of the plan.
The new rules also accelerate the reporting of gifts. Bona fide gifts of securities must now be reported on Form 4 within two business days of the gift and may no longer be reported on a delayed basis (i.e
.,
45 days after a company’s fiscal year-end on Form 5 as previously permitted).
Why are gifts of my company stock now required to be reported on Form 4?
Before the SEC amended Rule 10b5-1, it was an open issue whether insider trading liability could exist on gifts of securities. Under the new rules, the SEC has clarified that a Rule 10b5-1 plan may be used for gifts of securities. The SEC takes the view that a gift of securities is not truly a gift when the donor is aware that the recipient will sell the securities soon after receipt. And if this happens when the donor is in possession of material non-public information, then the donor could be subject to insider trading liability. Given the SEC’s newly stated position, it is likely best for executive insiders to act with extreme caution and limit gifts to open trading windows or in a Rule 10b5-1 plan.
We can help
As you determine how best to transact in your company securities, we’re ready to help you navigate ever-changing laws and regulations. We frequently work with the general counsels of public companies to implement and execute Rule 10b5-1 plans in accordance with a company’s insider trading policy, and to ensure compliance with securities laws while aligning with your goals.

Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 defines insiders as directors, executive officers or stockholders who possess stock that directly or indirectly results in beneficial ownership of more than 10% of the company's common stock or other class of equity. Section 16(a) requires reporting of transactions by insiders, while Section 16(b) imposes recapture of profits from short-swing transactions.
2
In 2000, the SEC codified Rule 10b5-1 to provide company insiders with an affirmative defense against insider trading claims when transactions in company securities are executed when the insider may be in possession of material non-public information. Full text of the final rules may be accessed on the SEC’s website in its adopting release:
https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2022/33-11138.pdf
.

SEC Form 4, Statement of Changes in Beneficial Ownership, must be filed within two business days of an insider transacting in company securities. SEC Form 5, Annual Statement of Changes in Beneficial Ownership of Securities, is generally due to the SEC no later than 45 days after the company’s fiscal year ends, and is only required from an insider when at least one transaction, because of an exemption or failure to report, was not reported during the year. Disclosure is mandatory and becomes public record upon filing.Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Semiconductors power everything from smartphones to electric vehicles. We think the sector’s battered stocks look primed for recovery.Where do we see investment opportunity in 2023?
We are bullish on two types of assets: those that could help investors weather an economic downturn, and those whose prices already reflect that outcome. We think semiconductor stocks fall squarely in the second camp.
After the sector boomed in 2020 and 2021, propelled by a surge of consumer and corporate investments in technology, 2022 brought a swift and severe reversal. Excess inventories, increasing geopolitical tensions and rapidly shifting consumption patterns spurred an almost 50% peak-to-trough decline.
But we think the worst is over for the USD 600 billion semiconductor industry, even as stocks have priced in the effects of a coming recession. We believe there are two reasons early 2023 presents an attractive entry point for investors: first, the growing power and scale of technology and other secular (structural) forces in the economy; and second, cyclical factors, such as the business cycle and market pricing.
Here to stay: Smarter smartphones, games and EVs
We turn first to long-term forces. Simply put, semiconductors are key components in a wide range of products, applications and services—valuable assets whatever the phase of the economic cycle.
Most semiconductors are complex products dependent on a serpentine supply chain. Only a relatively few companies can claim the design and manufacturing expertise to produce the most advanced chips.
Chipmakers clearly benefited from the past decade’s rapid evolution in cell phones and consumers’ seemingly insatiable appetite for more memory, faster processing speeds and more functionality.
But some observers may still underappreciate the significance of the transition from hardware memory storage to cloud computing, the exponential growth in the gaming industry, and connectivity and technology’s penetration in consumer durable products, from automobiles to thermostats. All this likely translates into strong, sustained demand for semiconductors.We think these structural forces will continue to boost the semiconductor sector over the next several years. Consumers still have high expectations for technological upgrades to their smartphones and computers, while companies are still investing heavily in digital transformation and cloud computing. Major players in the space require greater computational power, scale and efficiency to enhance their artificial and machine learning capabilities. Electric and next-generation automobiles can typically require twice as much chip content as traditional vehicles.
Finally, we note a global push by government policymakers to develop more resilient and secure semiconductor supply chains. The push comes in the wake of the worst months of a pandemic that exposed significant vulnerabilities in those supply chains. In the coming years, we think a range of upgrades could provide substantial support to the industry.
In the United States, the recently enacted
CHIPS Act
will spur investment in semiconductor research, and will develop and subsidize domestic production. Outside the United States, the European Union, Japan, Korea, India, Taiwan and, of course, China have prioritized the semiconductor industry. Still, despite government support, it will take quite some time to reconstitute a global semiconductor supply chain.
Cyclical opportunity: Weaker economic growth, better prices
While these structural supports have been in place for a while, cyclical forces have challenged the industry over the past year. In 2022, semiconductor companies contended with the most aggressive Federal Reserve rate hiking cycle in decades. They also grappled with suddenly bloated inventories (the effect of changing consumption patterns), China’s Zero-COVID policy (which has been recently lifted) and continued uncertainty over the U.S.-China relationship.
Investors pummeled semiconductor stocks in 2022. But partly as a result, we think the entry point today looks attractive.We compared the recent downturn in semiconductor stocks to seven previous episodes. Looking at price moves, earnings expectations and P/E multiples, the industry now seems close to a cyclical bottom. The median peak-to-trough price decline has been -30% versus -46% in this episode. The median earnings estimate revision has been -23% versus -24% in this episode, and valuations bottomed at a 13x forward price-to-earnings multiple versus the median of 13.1x.If, as we expect, the U.S. economy goes into recession in 2023, that could likely put a damper on semiconductor sales. But China’s reopening could provide a boost. Government incentives and more investment in capacity could benefit semiconductor equipment vendors.
Historically, after semiconductor stocks hit a bottom, they tend to perform strongly in recovery. In the one- and three-year periods following a cyclical bottom, semiconductor stocks have delivered median returns of 40% and 95%, respectively.
1
That seems a signal worth heeding.
Conclusion
In 2023, investors will likely face a demanding environment as companies and consumers manage the consequences of a historic global central bank rate hiking cycle. Recession may be unavoidable. With that backdrop, as investors, we like to be assertive in areas where we feel we are being appropriately compensated to take risk. We think the semiconductor industry is among the top of that list. Given the repricing that has already occurred and the prospective returns that could be supported by friendly government policy, we think you should consider taking a close look at semiconductor stocks.

Answer: at one point or another, all these people either wrote papers

, gave speeches or worked on negotiated solutions regarding fiscal deficits, entitlements and “generational theft”, which refers to the Federal debt passed on to future generations. There has been little progress so far. Here’s a look at inflation-adjusted Federal debt per capita since 1790. After the surge in government spending required to defeat the Axis powers during WWII, each American was responsible for $30k in Federal debt in today’s dollars. Today, that figure is 3x higher, and rising. When we compute the debt burden on the working age population, it looks even worse.A related issue: composition of government spending as entitlements crowd out discretionary spending that contributes to productivity and future growth.
Here’s a reminder of what discretionary spending is:Now here’s the chart. The balance between entitlement spending and non-defense discretionary spending started out at 1.0x when Medicare and Medicaid systems were created in the late 1960’s
2
. That ratio is now almost 3.0x and will rise to 4.0x in a few years. By 2032, entitlement payments plus interest are expected to consume all Federal revenue collection on a permanent basis, with little left for discretionary spending (see Appendix). Some partial solutions to narrow this gap appear below
3
; few of them are wildly popular, and it would take a combination of them to reduce the gap back to where it was in the late 1990’s.Partial solutions to close the gap (charts in Appendix)
Senator Sanders plan: large increase in income/capital gains taxes on incomes > $250k, raising 1% of GDP annually, spent entirely on discretionary spending
Senator Warren wealth taxes of 1% applied in excess of $20mm, which would raise 0.5%-0.7% of GDP per year (as per TPC), spent entirely on discretionary spending
Convert Social Security from a savings program to an entitlement program, then eliminate the cap on income used to compute Social Security taxes without raising benefits; use proceeds to boost discretionary spending
Means-testing of Medicare B and D, higher Medicare co-pays and deductibles, higher eligibility retirement age, further means-testing of Social Security, increased rebates by Medicare Part D drug manufacturers
Cut defense spending, close to a 70-year low as a share of GDP at 3.5% but 3
rd
highest in the world per capitaSo, now the Visigoths may block the debt ceiling increase unless the White House agrees to spending cuts and a balanced budget within 10 years
. Here are questions I’ve been getting and my answers to them:
Would any technical default be followed in short order by political negotiations to put things back on track, such as the Budget Control Act of 2011, the Gramm Rudman Hollings Deficit Control Act of 1985 and the Balanced Budget Reaffirmation Act of 1987? I think so, but have no idea how long it could take to get there
Will the Visigoths be able to maintain a united partisan front to fight the debt ceiling increase, since only 5 GOP defections would allow it? Not sure. According to CNN, some swing-state Republicans from districts Biden won or narrowly lost, and who are seen as most likely to break ranks with GOP leadership, said they’re not willing to back a clean debt ceiling increase and are insisting on a fiscal agreement first
If the debt ceiling were not raised, could the Treasury decide to pay certain obligations (such as interest on the Federal debt) and not others, which is referred to as “debt prioritization”? Unclear. That would require the Treasury to predict upcoming cash flows accurately and withhold cash in advance. Yellen’s public statements have indicated that she considers this beyond the Treasury’s ability to execute, although a transcript from a 2013 FOMC meeting includes comments on the Treasury’s intention to pay on time
4
Are Visigoth concerns about government spending genuine? Who knows and I’m not sure why it matters
Why don’t Visigoths raise the same issues when the GOP controls the White House? Politics
What might convince Visigoths to reverse course? Stock market correction, debt downgrade (e.g., 2011), opinion polls in the aftermath of a government shutdown and its various consequences
Is it “responsible” for Visigoths to do such a thing? Not according to our CEO or Janet Yellen
5
Why is the debt ceiling showdown occurring a few months before prior expectations? Higher Fed Funds rates increase the amount the Fed pays on reserves, and reduces what it pays to the Treasury. Higher interest on debt may increase the 2023 deficit to $1.3 trillion, above the $1.0 trillion deficit projected last May. April’s tax receipts will provide a grace period before summer deficits bring the issue to a head sometime between June and August after cash balances and extraordinary measures run out
Would there be a lasting economic impact from a government shutdown? Probably not; in past government shutdowns, federal workers were retroactively paid for the period when their departments were closed, even when there were no binding commitments in place to do so. Businesses would probably continue to produce and accumulate inventories in expectation of resumed government purchases when the debt ceiling is eventually raised
What did fixed income investors do last time, in 2011? Some switched from T-bills to longer duration Treasuries or bank deposits. I’m not sure it’s worth the aggravation given this bottom line:
a debt ceiling fight is much more likely to lead to temporary forced spending cuts than a long-lasting default on debt
Bottom line: if reasonable people cannot figure out how to fix debt and spending composition issues in a sustainable way, the Visigoths will try to do it for them, and with more economic disruption and political turmoil.
If the problem goes away somehow this year, and I suspect it will, that doesn’t mean that it won’t come back again. Not sure I want to be in this role when the true day of reckoning comes.

Debt Prioritization
. Several Republican House members may pursue legislation to force “debt prioritization,” under which Treasury only pay some obligations and not others, as spelled out in a specific bill. The Senate is unlikely to pass this, and it might create discord within the GOP based on whose oxes are gored. Secretary Yellen has stated that Treasury does not have the ability to carry out debt prioritization (a similar conclusion was reached in 2011), and also believes that it might still be viewed by the rest of the world as a default.
Spending Cuts with a Debt Limit Vote
: Speaker McCarthy and the House Republican caucus have agreed to tie any debt limit votes to new budget agreements and fiscal reforms. The demands appear to include limiting discretionary spending to FY22 levels, and adoption of a budget that balances within ten years. These are still general demands and not detailed proposals.
Bipartisan Commission
: Senator Manchin (D-WV) has called for a commission to negotiate spending cuts to pair with a debt ceiling vote. At this time, Democratic Leadership has shown no interest in agreeing to this. In 2011, in exchange for GOP votes on the debt ceiling, a Congressional commission was formed to recommend deficit reduction roughly equal to the size of the increase in the debt limit.

. Could Treasury solve the impasse without Congress by pursuing options like such issuance of a $1 trillion coin to deposit at the Fed, using the funds to all bills due? Secretary Yellen dismissed this approach as a “gimmick.”
Special Procedures - House of Representatives Discharge Petition
. If Democrats can find 5 or more GOP members to agree to a clean debt ceiling increase, they can try to force House Speaker McCarthy to bring the debt ceiling bill to the floor by pursuing a “discharge petition”. This would effectively force a vote on any legislative proposal in the House, and generally requires weeks of procedural steps to accomplish.
The Sack of Rome in 410 AD
Alaric I was the first king of the Visigoths, after serving in the Roman Army in support of Roman Emperor Theodosius. When Alaric marched on Rome in 410 AD, it was the first time in 800 years that the Eternal City had been attacked. The Visigoths looted and burned the city for 3 days, with the siege lifted only after thousands of pounds of gold, silver, silken tunics, scarlet-dyed hides and pepper were paid to Alaric as tribute, along with throngs of captives.

20th century entitlement politics
. When Medicare was introduced in the 1960s, it was described as “brazen socialism” in the Senate; one album released in 1961 was entitled “Ronald Reagan Speaks Out Against Socialized Medicine”. Two decades earlier, when Truman proposed a national healthcare program, the plan was called a Communist plot by a House sub-committee. And when FDR introduced Social Security in the 1930s, he was branded as a Communist sympathizer by Alf Landon (Roosevelt’s GOP opponent in the 1936 Presidential election), Republican Senators from Ohio, Pennsylvania and Minnesota, and publisher William Randolph Hearst.

Could a single-payer healthcare system bring down entitlement spending, leaving more room for discretionary spending?
Unclear. Such a system would presumably require that premiums now paid to private sector insurers become taxes to fund healthcare coverage for all citizens. A single-payer system would give the government more leverage to reduce Medicaid and Medicare costs. However, unless
availability
and
access
were curtailed, a single payer system does not guarantee a cheaper healthcare system. As shown in the Appendix,
the cost of entitlement programs has a history of vastly exceeding initial projections
.

Three procedures to handle government payments during a debt ceiling impasse: “The first one is that principal and interest payments on Treasury securities would continue to be made on time. The second principle is that the Treasury would decide each day whether to make or delay other government payments. The third principle is that any payments made would settle as usual. In terms of principal and interest payments, principal payments on maturing Treasury securities would be funded by Treasury auctions that roll over the maturing securities into new issues, so the new issues would fund the redemption of the maturing securities. Interest would be paid based on available cash in the Treasury general account. To make a coupon payment, however, the Treasury may need to delay or hold back making other government payments, even if it had sufficient balances on a given day, in order to accumulate sufficient funds to pay a future large coupon payment.” FOMC Conference Call Transcript, October 16, 2013

CNBC quoted Jamie as follows: “We should never question the creditworthiness of the US government. That is sacrosanct. It should never happen...Even questioning it is the wrong thing to do. That is just a part of the financial structure of the world. This is not something you should be playing games with at all”. Treasury Secretary Yellen said that a US debt default would ""cause irreparable harm to the US economy, the livelihoods of all Americans, and global financial stability.”Line chart shows inflation-adjusted Federal debt per capita since 1790.

MR. MICHAEL CEMBALEST: Good morning, everybody. This is the debt ceiling version of the Eye on the Market Outlook. So see if you can guess what the following people have in common, Erskine Bowles, who is the Democratic White House Chief of Staff, Kevin Warsh, who was on the Federal Reserve Board for a few years, Peter Orszag, an Obama appointee, ran both the OMB and the CBO, Michael Bennett, a Senator, a Democratic Senator from Colorado, Geoffrey Canada of the Harlem's Children's Zone, Mike Mullin, the 17
th
Chairman of the Joint Chief's of Staff, Richard Kogan of the very progressive Center of Budget and Policy Priorities, Mike O'Pake, who's an economist at the Federal Reserve, Bank of St. Louis. These aren't people you would necessarily associate with conservative points of views on fiscal policy.
That said, all of them have either written papers, given speeches, or worked on negotiated solutions on the issue of deficits, entitlements, and generational theft. They haven't had a lot of luck so far. The first chart in the Eye on the Market this week looks at the inflation adjusted federal debt since 1790. After the surge in spending in World War II, every American was responsible for about $30,000 in debt in today's dollars. That figures now almost 100,000. And when you look at the debt burden on the working age population, it looks even worse.
In addition to overall issues about the levels of debt, you've got a bigger issue, in my opinion, on the composition of spending, because what's happening is that discretionary spending, that contributes to productivity and growth, is shrinking relative to entitlement spending. And entitlements are important and critical, we all understand the purpose, why they were created in the late 1960s. But as a reminder, non-defense discretionary spending includes all sorts of things related to transportation; infrastructure, renewable energy, energy demonstration projects, inner-city rail, high-speed rail, air traffic control, education and training, job retraining, education subsidies for low-income students, vaccine development, border control, all sorts of things go in that category.
And in the late 1960s, once the entitlement system was created, the federal government spent a dollar on each. A dollar on the entitlements, and a dollar on all the other non-defense discretionary spending categories. By the 1990s, it was two to one in favor of entitlements. It's now around in favor of entitlements. And by 2032, in 10 years, it'll be four to one in favor of entitlements. And so, it's not just the level of the debt, it's the composition of government spending that's creating some issues.
Now, there's a lot of solutions one could—one could think about here. Both Senator Sanders and Senator Warren have proposed large increases in income and capital gains taxes on people earning over $250,000 or wealth taxes in excess of 20 million. You could raise taxes, spend that money entirely on non-defense discretionary spending and close that gap. You could do means testing of Medicare Part B and D. You could have higher Medicare copays and deductibles, higher eligibility retirement ages, increased rebates by Medicare Part D manufacturers. In other words, things to bring down the level of entitlement spending relative to non-defense discretionary spending.
You could also cut defense spending and use some of that money to boost non-defense discretionary spending. Right now, defense spending in the US is close to a 70 year low, believe it or not, as a share of GDP. Although, as you might suspect, on a per capita basis, we're the third highest in the world. And so, with this backdrop, the Visigoths, as I've chosen to call them in this piece called American Gothic, the Visigoths now say they're going to block the debt ceiling increase unless the White House agrees to spending cuts and a balanced budget agreement within 10 years.
So here are some questions I've been getting on this, and my answers to them. So most importantly, if there were a technical default of some kind, would it be followed shortly thereafter by some kind of negotiation to put things back on track, such as the Budget Control Act of 2011, there was the Graham-Rudman-Hollings Deficit Control Act in '85, and then a Balanced Budget Reaffirmation Act in '87. I think so. I don't know how long it would take to get there, but I certainly think the sequence of events would be, if there were technical default, you could have some kind of negotiations, things get back on track rather than any kind of restructuring of the federal debt in any emerging markets context.
Will the Visigoths be able to maintain their united partisan front to fight this debt ceiling increase? Unclear. It would only take five GOP defections to join the Democrats to go ahead and allow a debt ceiling increase. So it's unclear. According to CNN, there are some swing state Republicans from districts that were purple, that you'd consider most likely to break ranks with GOP leadership, who are—who are also saying, like the leadership in the caucus, that they don't want to back a clean debt ceiling increase unless there's some kind of fiscal agreement.
And look, nobody—it doesn't matter very much, but nobody knows whether the Visigoth concerns about government spending is genuine. And the fact that these same issues don't get raised quite as vividly when the GOB con—when the GOP controls the White House is politics. But again, that doesn't matter, because we are where we are. In 2011, you had a debt downgrade and stock market correction. And sometimes that causes politicians to change the things that they're doing.
But the bottom line from this week's piece is that reasonable people have had around 25 years to try to do something to fix both the debt levels and the spending composition issues in a sustainable way. And they haven't accomplished anything. So I'm not surprised that the Visigoths are going to try to do it for them, and with a lot more economic disruption and political turmoil. Now, I suspect the problem will go away this year in some way. But that doesn't mean that it's not going to come back again and again in the future, given the excessive levels of debt and also, some of the spending imbalances that we've—that we've mentioned here.
So there are some interesting charts that we've got here to look at for context; the net interest payments on the federal debt as a percentage of GDP, a history of US tax increases since 1950, and showing that the Sanders and Warren proposals would only get you part of the way of where you need to be if you really wanted to close that spending gap, some history on the estimated cost of healthcare entitlement systems and how the actual costs were generally much, much higher, some information on defense spending, et cetera, et cetera, and then a glossary of terms that you will need or may need over the next few months as you're trying to decipher the political jargon coming out of DC as these negotiations go ahead. So anyway, just a brief note for us on the debt ceiling issues. And look forward to talking to you again soon. Bye.

https://privatebank.jpmorgan.com/gl/en/insights/investing/what-is-driving-the-shift-to-a-circular-economy-in-todays-world,"Sustainable InvestingWhat is driving the shift to a circular economy in today's worldauthors:- Tamara Brianpublished Date:- Jan 27, 2023Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.
Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Three catalysts are driving the transition to sustainable practices—creating new momentum for companies that reduce, reuse and recycle resources, and new opportunities for investors.Smart investors who are looking to make the most of their capital over the long term are paying close attention to circular economy practices. After all, the potential benefit could be good for an individual’s portfolio— and help achieve sustainability.
The idea of a “circular” economy started in the 1970s as an academic’s dream: One day, the world would transform its “linear” economy, which operated in a take, make, waste model. Instead, it would adopt a new circular economy that would reduce, reuse and recycle the resources needed for modern life, creating a “closed loop” system that would be sustainable.
1
Over the decades, steps were taken toward making this dream a reality. Recycling laws were passed, innovative businesses were created, patents were registered, and more. Public awareness and enthusiasm slowly began to grow.
Still, humankind’s use of the earth’s resources has more than tripled
since 1970. If current practices remain unchanged, the number of earths we’d need could double again by 2050.
2
But now, three major catalysts—high inflation, climate change and legislation—are leading us to shift toward circular economic practices (e.g., using renewable energy and materials, building greater efficiency and less waste into supply chains, delivering goods and services virtually, and sharing products or otherwise prolonging their life spans through maintenance and intelligent design).
High inflation is changing businesses and consumers
Today’s persistently high inflation is leading some consumers and businesses to adopt circular economy practices. Central banks have continued to raise interest rates to help rein in inflation, as it hit 40-year highs recently.
Consumer behavior naturally changes when inflation is high, as people limit their expenditures and make trade-offs about what is essential versus what is expendable. For example:
The retail resale market is surging. According to thredUp 2022 Resale Report, the global fashion resale market is expected to grow 127% by 2026, three times faster than the broader retail clothing sector. The study also found that 58% of consumers say second-hand has helped them in some way during a time of inflation, and 25% say they will consider buying more second-hand apparel if prices keep rising.
3
Companies providing refurbishment services, such as home, car and clothing repairs, are also set to benefit as consumers delay purchases of new items and extend the life of existing ones. The annual growth rate of the consumer electronics repair and maintenance market is forecast to grow as cost benefits of repairing old equipment rather than disposing of it increases.
4
Inflation is also leading businesses to search for cost savings, often by recycling materials. Most supply-chain leaders expect profits to increase between now and 2025 as a result of applying circular economy principles.
5
Clearly, savvy investors should be on the lookout for companies that are conscientiously recycling their resources and avoiding waste.
In addition to inflation, the drive to mitigate climate change is also causing some consumers and businesses to adopt circular economy practices.
Over the next 20 years, the global temperature is expected to reach or exceed 1.5° C of warming above pre-industrial levels.
6
To stop that trend, urgent action is required—and individuals and corporates are responding, seeing the necessity to better manage their waste and reduce their consumption.
7
Government policies now encourage the transition
Some governments are supporting the shift to a circular economy.
The European Union has taken specific legislative actions to encourage the flow of capital toward companies that would help create a sustainable economy. To help focus investors’ attention and financing, the “EU Taxonomy” was established to identify and define six environmental objectives, including transitioning to a circular economy as well as climate change mitigation and adaption.
8
Meanwhile, in the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act promises to spend $369 billion to tackle climate change and reduce carbon emissions by 40% by 2030. The law directly offers strong incentives for battery recycling and manufacturer-led solutions for sustainably disposing products at the end of their useful lives.
9
The act has helped prompt major car companies to announce partnerships with manufacturers to recycle batteries from their electric vehicles.
10
One major car company predicts that 85% of a car could be recycled.
11
U.S. states also have stepped in. Some, such as California, Maine and Oregon, are adopting Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) laws to force companies to reclaim products at the ends of their lives.
12
Elsewhere, the Chinese government has committed to promoting a circular economy as part of its fourteenth Five-Year Plan (2021–2025).
13
We can help
Estimates show that the shift to circular economy practices could generate $4.5 trillion of additional economic growth by 2030.
14
A study by McKinsey shows that companies that adopt four out of these six potential circular economy practices might significantly improve their performance and reduce their costs:
15
Regenerate (shifting to renewable energy)
Share (promoting the sharing of products and prolonging lifespans)
Optimize (improving efficiency and removing waste from supply chains)
Loop (keeping materials in “closed loops” through remanufacturing and recycling)
Virtualize (virtual delivery)
Exchange (replacing old materials with advanced renewable ones)
16
We can help investors access these themes through managed funds in the public equity market, or in the private sector via venture capital opportunities. If you want to begin exploring circular economy investment opportunities, speak with your J.P. Morgan team today.

Sarah Backer, Wealth Planning Strategy
The new year is an opportunity to make a fresh start—and we can help you make the most of it.
Last year, many people felt like much was out of their control, given the market volatility, downturn in both stocks and bonds, rising inflation, the Federal Reserve’s fastest-ever set of large interest rate hikes and more.
While we expect economic growth to be relatively slow this year, we also see significant potential ahead for investors.
1
But no matter what turn the economy and markets take, there’s much you might do to help optimize your personal finances. Here, we offer 10 actions to consider taking now.
Assess where you are
1. Ready your portfolio for the year ahead.
Given 2022’s market volatility: Is your overall plan still on track to meet your goals? Does each pool of capital still support your intention for it? Are you taking the right amount of risk for your goals and time horizon? How do you feel about the level of risk you took last year?
Your feelings and priorities as well as current market conditions should shape your portfolio this year. As valuations have recently reset, we believe there has not been a more attractive entry point for a traditional portfolio of stocks and bonds in over a decade.
2
2. Hold your cash wisely.
How much cash are you holding? We recommend having only enough cash to fund a few years of living expenses, meet any near-term large outlays, keep on hand some “dry powder” to fund opportunistic investments and serve as a psychological safety net. As you look to invest this liquidity, we suggest you consider getting into fixed income now because it’s offering stronger valuations and higher yields than have been available since 2010.
3
After meeting those needs, you should put any excess cash to work toward your longer-term goals.
3. Review your life insurance policies
. If you have any life insurance policies, review them to make sure they still support your goals. Have your circumstances changed since you last looked? For tax and estate planning purposes, does the right person own the policy and are the optimal beneficiaries named? Is its cash value depleted because of last year’s volatility?
Many people with illiquid estates have life insurance to help pay estate taxes. Life insurance can also be beneficial for wealth transfer, business owners’ wealth plans and as part of a portfolio of financial assets.
Take the right steps
4. Complete the annual “to-dos.
” Each year there are certain steps you should take. Completing them earlier in the year is often more tax-efficient.
a. Fund retirement accounts—
Fully fund retirement accounts to take advantage of their tax-deferral benefits. For 2023, the contribution limits for accounts such as 401(k)s or 403(b)s are $22,500, and $30,000 if age 50 or older. For IRAs, the limits are $6,500, and $7,500 if age 50 or older.
b. Make annual exclusion gifts—
If you have the capacity and desire to gift, using your annual exclusion each year is a powerful way to do so without any gift tax consequences. This year, the limit increased to $17,000; for married couples, it’s $34,000.
5. Consider using your full lifetime transfer tax exclusion.
The lifetime exclusion amount increased this year to $12.92 million per person ($25.84 million for a married couple). If you have the capacity and desire to give to your loved ones during your lifetime, consider making your gift this year (the exclusion amount is scheduled to decrease in 2026 to about $7 million).
Even if you’ve already used all of your exclusion, this year’s annual inflation adjustment to the exclusion amount means that individuals can gift another $860,000 tax-free this year (that would be $1.72 million for married couples).
6. Increase your portfolio’s tax efficiency.
We suggest three possible actions for tax efficiency here: First, to keep as much of your portfolio’s returns as possible, you’ll want to consider the account types your assets are held in. Generally speaking, asset classes that generate ordinary income, have high turnover and offer high returns are best held in tax-advantaged accounts.
Second, to help make the most of your taxable accounts, consider investing in a strategy that allows you to harvest tax losses continuously.
And third, if you’re making withdrawals from your portfolio, think about the proper order of accounts from which you should take cash.
7. Adjust to higher rates.
In 2022, the Fed hiked rates seven times, and this year, more increases may come. But don’t let these increases discourage you from considering rate-sensitive wealth transfer techniques such as grantor retained annuity trusts (GRATs) and intra-family loans.
The success of these techniques depends heavily on the assets’ growth. We believe it’s therefore more important to look at the assets’ potential for appreciation than interest rates. If you have an existing GRAT, look into whether you might be able to swap out any depressed assets (replacing them with cash), and use those assets to fund a new GRAT with a better chance of success.
Higher rates have made leverage more expensive now than it was a year ago. Still, you might want to consider establishing a line of credit that can help you manage lumpy cash flows and potentially take advantage of compelling investment opportunities.
If you have an existing adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) that will reset this year, it would be wise to check the ARM’s cap, as many rates are set to increase considerably. You might be able to fix your rate at a lower level.
Protect your family and values
8. Plan your charitable giving.
First, look at the charitable gifts you made in 2022 and ask yourself: “Which causes do I want to continue supporting this year?” Then consider the best way to give.
In times of economic uncertainty, being both strategic and intentional with your charitable gifts can help maximize their impact and provide stability to the organizations you support.
4
Especially if you’re expecting 2023 to be a high-income year, consider contributing to a donor-advised fund (DAF). With a DAF, you can receive an immediate income tax deduction for your contribution but decide on which nonprofits to support when you’re ready.
9. Articulate your family’s values.
The new year is a good time to reflect and recenter your family around the family’s values and a collective vision of success. Consider hosting a family meeting to align the entire family, educate members on topics of common interest, and share family history and stories.
10. Protect your accounts and devices.
Safeguard your assets and information by implementing the right controls. Enable account alerts to receive notifications of potentially unauthorized activity and enroll in fraud prevention services such as ACH debit block for enhanced security. And remember to periodically update and strengthen your passwords to be strong and complex so they cannot be easily guessed – and never share them.
Also reduce your risk of downloading malware and viruses by installing anti-virus and ad-blocking software on all your devices.

Many of these potential actions should be made in the context of your entire wealth plan so that you’re prepared for 2023 and for the years ahead. Your J.P. Morgan team is ready to help you, your family and your team of professional advisors to find—and carry out—those actions that might serve you best.1

Our Top Market Takeaways for January 27, 2023.
Market update
Off to the races
With a gain of more than 2%, the S&P 500 is headed into the weekend firmly above 4,000 for the first time since mid-December. The breadth of the rally was wide, with nearly 400 stocks in the green on the week. The tech-laden NADSAQ 100 outperformed, with its +4% rise pushing it above its 200 moving average for the first time since March 2022.
That said, stocks don’t have an all-clear signal yet. Only one-quarter of the S&P 500 has reported Q4 2022 earnings. The takeaway so far: a mixed bag, but better than feared. For one, J&J beat earnings, despite a slowdown in revenue and sales in the face of a strong dollar and diminishing COVID-19 vaccine demand. Microsoft’s Azure cloud business persists as its engine of growth, but the company seems poised to guide expectations lower from here. Looking ahead, many of the “big name” announcements are still to come, including the likes of Google, Apple and Amazon next week.
In the bond market, Treasury yields did a round trip as economic data showed bits of both strength and weakness. On one hand, preliminary U.S. Manufacturing and Services PMIs for January continued to point toward contraction. On the other, filings for unemployment benefits hit their lowest level since early last year. This leaves investors wondering when, and if, the next shoe will drop.
Elsewhere, the U.S. government is still grappling over what to do with the debt ceiling, the December PCE deflator comes out this morning, and other big macro catalysts, such as the February FOMC meeting and January nonfarm payrolls, are on deck for next week.
In the meantime, here are
five quick observations worth paying attention to.
1. The U.S. economy: Strong (at first glance), but losing steam.
The latest GDP data showed that the U.S. economy grew at a +2.9% real (inflation-adjusted) pace through the final quarter of 2022. The headline number implies strength, but digging into the details reveals less favorable dynamics. There were three components that caught our attention: 1) inventories, which continued to build as goods demand weakened, contributing about half of the growth reported; 2) consumption, which came in still solid, but slower than expected; and 3) capex (offering a pulse check on corporate America), which appears to be cooling despite firm spending on tech. In all, the report suggests that while the U.S. economy grew at the end of last year, it appears to be losing momentum.2. The bond market: A record start.
Bloomberg’s Global Bond Index has surged over +3% in 2023, the best start to a year in over two decades. The prospect of the end of the global tightening cycle is prompting borrowers to seek opportunities to raise financing and making investors finally ready to take on debt. Global issuance of investment- and speculative-grade government and corporate bonds across currencies reached near $600 billion year-to-date (through January 18), the biggest tally on record for the period.
Take Caesars Entertainment (stock +27% year-to-date), which offered over $3 billion in bonds and leveraged loans earlier this week, one of the biggest refinancing deals in both markets this year. Investors jumping on “risky” debt issuance gives companies like Caesars a little longer runway, but it’s unclear what the Federal Reserve thinks about the recent easing of financial conditions. We still prefer to stay in the high-quality parts of the market, given we expect spreads for riskier bonds to widen meaningfully from here in the event of a recession.
3. European equities: First inflows in nearly a year.
While the sum of inflows was only $200 million last week, it’s a significant turnaround from near-record outflows just one year ago. The catalyst: The worst-case economic scenario for the region seems to have faded over the past few months. A warmer-than-feared winter has left natural gas supplies near ~75% of storage capacity, relative to the ~55% typically seen at this time of the season. The strength in activity data (most recently, January Eurozone composite PMIs unexpectedly entered expansionary territory for the first time since last summer) combined with easing inflationary pressures from dramatically lower energy prices has led to a +20% equity rally (in local currency terms) from late last year’s lows. For U.S. dollar investors reaping the tailwind of a weaker USD, it’s an even higher 30%. Looking ahead, investors may look at the still wide valuation discounts (~25% relative to the United States), brighter economic growth prospects and a peaking dollar as reasons to keep adding to ex-U.S. exposure.4. Corporate layoffs: The list is growing, yet the stocks are among the best performers this year.
The latest tally of layoffs (which now include many of the mega cap tech names) reveal that the companies are persistently contained within tech, finance and real estate—the most interest-rate-sensitive sectors of the economy. Notably, so far this year, these sectors in the S&P 500 are also at the top of the returns leader board. Communication services (+13.4%), tech (+9.4%) and real estate (+8.2%) are outperforming the broader index (+5.6%), with financials (+5.8%) nearly in line. Broad weakness across industries has yet to reveal itself (as we expect in our base-case scenario by year-end), yet these dynamics are keeping the sought-after soft-landing window open.5. Housing: Finding a footing.
Following a record string of declines over the past two years, sales of new homes in the United States rose for a third consecutive month in December. Housing starts for single-family homes also saw their first gain in four months. The 1% fall in mortgage rates catalyzed the largest weekly jump in mortgage applications since 2020. While it’s hard to tell a story or predict a path forward from early-days datapoints, signs are pointing toward a sense of stability in what has been the most beaten-up segment of the economy over the past year.
The equity market is also paying attention to the green shoots. S&P Homebuilders, which includes businesses from appliance stores to, the obvious, home building materials sellers, bottomed in June of last year and is now up near +30% from lows (with over a third of the rally coming just over the past few weeks). While housing market conditions are merely inflecting, the equity market is starting to feel comfortable with the direction of travel.
The remaining question lies in how the Fed is feeling about, by one metric, the loosest financial conditions we’ve seen since early last year.
The shift in sentiment is reactivating capital markets, but early optimism may be a concern in the midst of still-elevated inflation. At the February FOMC meeting, we expect Chair Powell to hike the policy rate by 25 basis points and remain on the front foot with hawkish rhetoric.
Although the end of the tightening cycle is likely near, we also believe we’re not yet out of the woods. Investors have historically been rewarded for sticking with their long-term plans, and in regard to opportunities that fit within their risk profiles, among the ones we think are worth considering today are core fixed income, preferreds, small and mid-cap equities, and more specific dislocated segments such as semiconductors.

https://privatebank.jpmorgan.com/gl/en/insights/investing/how-do-you-trade-usd-weakness,"Investment StrategyHow do you trade USD weakness?authors:- Samuel Ziefauthors:- Yuxuan Tangpublished Date:- Feb 9, 2023Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.
Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Massive moves in the FX market have been a major focus for investors of late. The Dollar Index (commonly referred to as the DXY index) has shed over 10% since its highs in late September, following a historic +27% rally in the last year and a half. As we mentioned in our 2023 Outlook, we expect dollar weakness to be one of the key themes of macro trades this year. So why is this the case? And how may investors play the theme now?
To understand why weakness in the U.S. dollar could be a sustained trend, it’s helpful to look at what happened in 2022. During 1H, the Fed started hiking aggressively – at a pace that hadn’t been seen in the past 40 years – in the face of a large inflation overshoot. USD rates shot up much quicker than other major currencies. A wider interest rate differential in favor of the U.S. drove a rally in the dollar. In 2H, other central banks started to catch up in terms of hiking rates, but the global growth environment was incredibly weak. In particular, China was going through rolling lockdowns. Europe was facing a potentially very deep energy crisis. Global equity market declines had also deepened. This drove another leg of dollar strength as investors sought a safe haven. The confluence of factors drove the dollar to highly overvalued levels – as much as 20% higher than its modeled fair value (based on 5-year interest rate differentials) at the peak.What we’ve been seeing the last few months – and what we expect to continue into 2023 – is the erosion of all these pillars that pushed the dollar stronger in 2022. Interest rate expectations are peaking in the U.S. but still rising in the rest of the developed world. In other words, rate differentials have started to turn from a support for the dollar to a headwind. Looking ahead, USD rates will likely continue to “catch down” to other developed markets as U.S. inflation trends lower and the Fed reaches the end of its hiking cycle. Meanwhile, with inflation staying sticky in Europe and picking up in Japan, policy directions of these central banks are more likely to tilt towards the hawkish side. From an asset allocation standpoint, with the disappearance of negative yielding debt in Europe and Japan – and U.S. equities perhaps no longer outperforming global indices – we could start to see a rebalancing of U.S. asset overweights in global portfolios.
Global growth dynamics, the second pillar of dollar strength in 2022, are also shifting. The reopening in China has been faster than expected. In Europe, this winter has turned out to be less cold than had been feared, and natural gas prices have fallen 70% from the peak. Increasingly, the U.S. is looking less exceptional from a growth perspective.
Add in the fact that the U.S. dollar still screens 10% overvalued, and we see some further weakness ahead.
How to trade USD weakness?
Positioning for a weaker dollar generally happens in two stages: First, currencies and precious metals that tend to provide lower growth and yield (like the Euro, Japanese yen, Swiss franc, and gold, aka the “low yielders”) tend to strengthen. And later, when the global economy demonstrates full-on early cycle dynamics, higher-growth-oriented currencies (like commodity FX and emerging markets, aka the “high beta”) will likely join the rally in a more sustained way.
We are currently in the first stage.
Here are a few ways that we favor participating in this trade:
1. The Euro
The Euro recently rebounded from sub-parity against the dollar to levels seen before the Ukraine crisis. The worst fears for the winter period have not played out, and we have seen large declines in natural gas prices. We still see upside in the Euro from here in the near term. The market is pricing the European Central Bank to hike rates above 3.25% this year. This shift in interest rate differentials is consistent with fair value for EURUSD above 1.15. However, we’d note that energy prices will need to remain benign for us to really see the shift towards fair value. Otherwise, some Europe-specific risk premium will likely stay.2. The Japanese yen
Moves in USDJPY are closely correlated with interest rate differentials. Over the past two years, changes in the spread between 10-year U.S. treasury yields and 10-year JGB yields explain 80-90% of the moves in USDJPY. Over the recent months, traders started to bet on higher JPY rates (as shown by the spikes in the swap rate), especially after the surprise announcement by the BOJ to widen the yield curve control (YCC) band in late December. While the BOJ meeting in January underwhelmed the market by leaving all monetary policy settings unchanged, the longer-term trajectory is still highly JPY supportive, in our view. The currency remains undervalued especially given that rate differentials look poised to continue to narrow. Core inflation in Japan recently rose to almost two times the BOJ target, and with wage inflation rising, the composition of inflation pressure has shifted from mostly imported to more home-grown, which is a sign of stickier inflation from here. Eventually the central bank would have to think about further normalization in monetary policies.3. Gold
While the functionality of gold as an inflation hedge is being increasingly questioned, the yellow metal could shine again this year. Historically, gold prices usually gain support from a weaker dollar and lower real yields. With yields peaking in the U.S., the trough in gold could be behind us, with the metal joining the rally of the low yielders. We favor gold not only as a way to participate in the weaker dollar trend, but also from a portfolio diversification standpoint.
Does RMB fit in this trade?
The RMB is getting strong support from improved sentiment thanks to the rapid reopening in China and continued inflows as global portfolios close their large underweights in Chinese assets. Coupled with broad weakness in the dollar, USDCNH declined from a high of above 7.3 to 6.7 levels. However, long CNH is still not how we would express the China re-opening theme (we would rather focus on equities and credits, as discussed in
a recent article
). Negative carry and risks of further deterioration in the balance of payments as we move through the year suggest that not all CNH-negative factors are neutralized. As the slowdown in goods demand from U.S. and European consumers continues, China’s exports will likely deteriorate from high teens growth over the past two years to a significant contraction this year. At the same time, outflows could see a boost if outbound tourism resumes. Given these factors and how fast CNH has moved, we don’t favor it as a way to trade dollar weakness from here. For dollar-based investors looking to add exposure to CNY-denominated assets, one strategy would be to hedge out FX risks and lock in a positive carry.All market and economic data as of February 10, 2023 and sourced from Bloomberg Finance L.P. and FactSet unless otherwise stated.

RISK CONSIDERATIONS
Investments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities, particularly if the instruments involve leverage. The value of commodity-linked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements, commodity index volatility, changes in interest rates, or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity, such as drought, floods, weather, livestock disease, embargoes, tariffs and international economic, political and regulatory developments. Use of leveraged commodity-linked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but, at the same time, creates the possibility for greater loss.​
Holders of foreign securities can be subject to foreign exchange risk, exchange-rate risk and currency risk, as exchange rates fluctuate between an investment’s foreign currency and the investment holder’s domestic currency. Conversely, it is possible to benefit from favorable foreign exchange fluctuations.

https://privatebank.jpmorgan.com/gl/en/insights/giving/four-strategies-for-impactful-disaster-relief-giving,"PhilanthropyFour strategies for impactful disaster relief givingpublished Date:- Feb 8, 2023Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.
Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Natural disasters have increased in intensity on a warming planet, presenting new challenges to governments, disaster preparedness professionals and all of us as individual citizens.Philanthropy and private generosity have always played a significant role in relief and recovery efforts, but donors today have an important opportunity in preparing for and responding to deadlier storms, wildfires and extreme heat, droughts and other unpredictable events.
Disaster giving is much broader than giving in the immediate aftermath of an event. As donors contribute to emergency relief efforts, they’re also thinking about the long-term recovery of these regions and funding preparedness and resiliency efforts.
Because more disasters will come, it’s helpful for donors to refresh their understanding of disaster relief.
This guidance offers a framework for your considerations:
1. Recognize the phases of natural disasters
The disaster life cycle typically includes four phases:
Mitigation:
Efforts in this phase include risk analysis for future events and applying strategies to reduce the negative effects of natural disasters.
Preparedness:
The phase immediately before a disaster hits is characterized by activities such as preparing sandbags for a flood, stockpiling food and water in advance of a snowstorm or ensuring healthcare providers have adequate support and personal protective equipment.
Response:
Most of us are familiar with the response phase, when the focus is on saving lives and minimizing damage in the immediate aftermath of an emergency.
Recovery:
The rebuilding of homes, businesses, and other infrastructure is critical to returning a community to its pre-disaster state. This stage may also include reform efforts to address and repair the social and physical infrastructure that may have exacerbated the disaster.
Not all disasters experience these phases in the same time frame or even in the same order. For instance, floods are slow-moving disasters, giving communities a chance to focus on preparedness in advance of floodwaters. Tornadoes, on the other hand, occur suddenly and with little warning, leaving mere minutes to prepare. Contagious disease outbreaks are similarly hard to predict, especially those that reach pandemic proportions.
Understandably, most philanthropic assistance focuses on the immediate response to a disaster, when public attention is at its highest. Research by the Center for Disaster Philanthropy and Candid found that one-third of total giving is completed less than four weeks after a sudden disaster, and two-thirds of giving is done within two months. By the time recovery efforts are underway, donations have nearly ceased.
But donations during the phases of recovery, mitigation and preparedness can have tremendous impact. A study from the National Institute of Building Sciences found that in the United States, every $1 the federal government spent on natural disaster mitigation efforts saved $6 in future costs, in addition to hundreds of lives saved and the creation of thousands of new jobs. Given the remarkable return on investment, mitigation efforts can provide an opportunity for philanthropy to make a significant impact, especially in areas that are prone to seasonal weather events such as hurricanes, floods, wildfires and tornadoes.
2. Support long-term efforts as well as immediate needs
In the immediate aftermath of a tragedy, cash is the best donation. Needs can change swiftly, and those working on the ground are best equipped to determine what those needs are.
However, when you are moved to give in the days, weeks or months following a disaster, consider also making an equivalent donation to long-term recovery or prevention efforts, or directing your donation to an organization that also addresses the other phases of a disaster. Much like mitigation of natural disasters can have an enormous return on investment, giving to long-term projects can minimize damage in the future. While a Coronavirus outbreak requires immediate investment to support hospitals, healthcare workers and other logistics, for example, a simultaneous donation to research into treatment and prevention of the disease could help ensure future outbreaks are far less severe.
Donations made soon after disaster hits can still be directed to long-term recovery efforts. The effects of wildfires, which devastated the west coast of the United States earlier this year, and tornadoes, like the ones which struck communities across at least ten states late last year, are still being keenly felt, with communities still just beginning to rebuild. Even areas of New York and New Jersey are still recovering from Hurricane Sandy, which struck nearly ten years ago. No one knows exactly how long the world will be experiencing the ramifications of the COVID-19 pandemic, but it’s likely that the causes and organizations focused on long-term recovery on both the individual and community levels will be at work for years to come. The Center for Disaster Philanthropy has several funds to address mid- and long-term recovery efforts in a variety of geographic areas, and community foundations often maintain funds for resiliency long past immediate media coverage.
3. Beware of scams
Unfortunately, tragedies often spark an increase in bogus charitable organizations looking to take advantage of well-intentioned individuals. Resources such as Candid’s GuideStar and Charity Navigator provide information such as financial statements and IRS filings that can help you determine if an organization is legitimate.
Community foundations in the affected areas can also be great resources. When tragedy strikes, these organizations often set up recovery funds that are granted out over a longer time period to trusted nonprofit partners working directly in the affected geographic area through all phases of relief and recovery. Or, if you prefer to give directly, community foundations can provide a wealth of information regarding reputable local organizations.
4. Build disaster relief into your philanthropic budget
It is not a matter of if, but when disasters will occur. Consider setting aside a percentage or amount of your annual giving for immediate disaster relief, then re-balancing your giving portfolio as needed. If your philanthropic strategy focuses on a particular sector, support organizations working in that topic area. For instance, if your philanthropy supports health-related causes, consider giving to hospitals or other organizations working to contain a sudden disease outbreak. As another example, donors focused on education might assist with rebuilding schools damaged by a natural disaster.
By using donor-advised fund (DAF) to help when and where tragedy strikes, you can be assured that your dollars will go directly to legitimate organizations that are making the most impact. DAF sponsors, like National Philanthropic Trust — administrator of the J.P. Morgan Charitable Giving Fund — handle the due diligence necessary to ensure that the charity you wish to support – whether local or global – is operating legally. Sponsors like NPT also have multiple channels to help you support international charities, so no matter where disaster hits, you can give.

Sarah Stillpass, Global Investment Strategist
Our Top Market Takeaways for February 03, 2023.
Market update
The bulls are back in town
The initial descent.
The big takeaway from the week is that central banks seem pleased with the progress they have made on inflation, even if they aren’t ready to declare victory. The Federal Reserve raised rates by only 25 basis points (bps), and Chair Powell used words such as “welcome” and “gratifying” to describe the most recent “disinflationary” data. Meanwhile, in Europe, Christine Lagarde also conceded that the inflation picture has improved, even though she vowed that another 50-basis-point hike was coming in March.
While the campaign against inflation isn’t over, the tone has clearly changed. Perhaps most importantly, the Fed seemed disinterested in the market rally so far this year—a notable shift from communication last fall that was designed at least in part to raise credit spreads and lower equity prices. The inflation emergency is over, while the latent risks to growth remain.Dovish reaction.
Markets rallied this week. Bond yields fell across the curve, with 2-year Treasury yields dropping to their lowest levels since October. Ten-year Treasury yields dropped below the technically important 3.5% level, and 30-year mortgage rates are approaching 6%. Markets are still implying an ~80% probability of another 25-basis-point hike at the next Fed meeting in March, but it seems like risks are finally skewed toward the Fed doing less than that. Core bonds, our top idea heading into the year, have returned close to
4%
already.
Equities cheered this week. The NASDAQ 100 ripped by over
+4%
, while the S&P 500 gained over
+2%
. Some interesting cyclical names made new 52-week highs, including Pulte, DR Horton, Lennar, Wynn, Starbucks, Tapestry, and ON Semiconductor. European equities surged to post-invasion highs, and are now flat over the last year.
The VIX implied equity volatility index closed at one of its lowest levels of the last year, and the MOVE implied bond volatility index made its lowest close since last March. Lower volatility is welcome news for investors. We did think markets would be stronger in 2023, and a 10% year-to-date rally in global equities is a great start.Mixed bag for data.
Besides the Fed, there were plenty of data points for investors to parse through. This morning, the latest employment report crushed economist expectations, and showed that the United States economy gained over 500,000 jobs in the month of January, while the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%. While there could be some seasonal quirks that overstate the strength, this reduces near term recession risk, but also confirms that the Fed will probably still raise rates one or two more times during this cycle.
The S&P Manufacturing PMI for the US stabilized at 46.9 (verses 46.2 last month), while the ISM Manufacturing survey deteriorated further to 47.4. Markets were much more focused on the Fed’s decision and tone, and would probably justify the economic weakness as proof that higher rates are having their intended impact.
The most perplexing piece of data was probably the JOLTS Job Openings, which signaled a surge in labor demand from companies despite the plethora of headlines about layoffs from the tech sector.
Over in Europe, headline inflation came in softer than expected (8.5% YoY verses 8.9% expected), thanks to the big drop in energy prices. While the core measure was still firm (5.2% YoY), falling energy prices will help alleviate the cost-of-living crisis and will help improve the outlook for the region.Learnings from earnings.
While the outright read of this quarter’s earnings season is pretty weak (earnings have surprised to the downside in aggregate relative to a
+4.1%
average beat over the last four quarters), the market has largely shrugged it off. Just last night, behemoths Apple, Amazon and Alphabet reported lackluster results, but that has merely dented the year-to-date rally.
On the other hand, perhaps the star of earnings seasons so far has been Meta (nee Facebook), which surged by ~25% after reporting stronger than expected results and outlining a plan to return capital to shareholders through buybacks.
What it means for you.
In our
outlook
, we wrote that markets were presenting investors with potentially one of the best entry points for a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds in a decade. Even though markets have started the year off stronger than most could have imagined, those that are building a long-term portfolio should still feel confident about putting their capital to work.
The major headwinds of 2022 (inflation, hawkish central banks and a collapse in housing activity) are receding, while the prospects for Europe and China are improving. The U.S. economy is not out of the woods, but the rally that we have seen to start the year signals that expectations are still low. Most importantly, investors have compelling options across asset classes, geographies and investment styles, at least for now.

In January 2018, the Fed Funds Target Rate and ECB Deposit Rate were 1.50% and -0.40%, respectively. In January 2019, the Fed rate was 2.50%, whereas the ECB rate was still in the negatives at -0.40%. In February 2020, the Fed rate was 1.75% and the ECB rate was -0.50%. The ECB rate remained at -0.50% until January 2022. It then moved to 0% in January 2022 before climbing into positive territory at 0.75% through August 2022. From there, the ECB deposit rate continued to climb and finished 2022 at 2%, and currently sits at 2.5% as of February 2, 2023. The Fed rate was 1.25% by March 2020 and then was brought down significantly to 0.25% by March 2020, where it stayed through March 2022, when the first hike was made. By June 2022, the Fed rate hit 1.75% after multiple hikes, and then continued to move to 3.25% by October 2022, and by December 2022, it was 4.5%. In February 2023, another Fed rate hike occurred, and the rate now sits at 4.75%.This chart shows the index price return for the S&P 500, NASDAQ 100 and STOXX Europe 600 from February 2022 through February 2, 2023.

Markets this week have been choppy as they digest a slew of economic data and Fed communications. Last Friday’s U.S. jobs report was a major market mover – nonfarm payrolls surged a shocking 517k (vs estimates of 190k) with strength across the board. We think this print makes it less likely that the 25bps rate increase on the February FOMC meeting was the last hike. This reinforces our base case outlook of a recession in the U.S., as rates are more likely to stay restrictive and continued tightness in the labor market makes the Fed's job difficult. Markets reacted quickly with a 20bp-bounce in 10-year Treasury yields, and a stronger dollar.
In equities, the S&P 500 hovered just below the 4,200 level after finishing one of the strongest Januarys in decades. This has left the valuation of the index stretched at 18.4x forward P/E, which is far above its 25-year average of 16.5x. Hence, we advocate considering protecting gains with structured products when it comes to broad U.S. markets. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index has also rallied approximately 15% year-to-date, at which level we would advocate considering taking some profits in mega-cap tech, particularly given the potential for upcoming earnings disappointments. It could also be a moment to revisit overall strategic asset allocations and shift into areas where we have higher conviction, i.e. Chinese equities (read on for more details), European equities, and core fixed income strategies.
Strategy Question: How strong is China’s reopening recovery?
After a rapid exit from Zero Covid policy, infections across China spiked over the course of December. Although case numbers can’t be compared with rates seen during periods of mandatory mass testing, anecdotal evidence suggests the infection curve has flattened. During the Chinese New Year holiday period a consumption rebound was evident across many sectors. Relative to pre-COVID times (using 2019 as the benchmark), domestic tourism recovered to 89% by number of trips, and 73% in terms of total revenue. Spending on restaurant dining fully recovered, while box office revenues already exceeded 2019 levels. While Macau’s visitation only recovered to ~45% of pre-COVID levels during Chinese New Year holidays and the first five days of February, gross gaming revenue showed a larger 60%+ recovery vs. pre-COVID levels for the mass market. This bodes well for further recovery and normalization. In addition, Hainan offshore duty free store sales grew 20% YoY during the holidays, illustrating a strong travel rebound for the island. As the road to recovery continues we expect the market performance to be resilient, while any additional pent-up demand could translate to meaningful upside. In contrast, while goods spending continues to grow, big ticket items like car sales are down double digits (partly due to a phase out of car purchase subsidies). Housing sales continue to remain very depressed (around one third of 2019 levels), which weighs on durable goods sales.The strong bounce back in service sector consumption could support our view that economic growth likely bottomed this winter. The January non-manufacturing PMI recovered to 54.4, while service sector PMI rose to 52.9, from contraction territory since the summer of 2022.  We expect growth to start improving sequentially in the first quarter of 2023, led by continued recovery in the service sector. While we expect that consumer services such as healthcare, leisure and tourism could grow at an even faster pace compared with pre-COVID years, given the drag from reduced spending on big ticket items, we expect overall consumption growth could improve compared with 2022, but still fall short of 2019 rates of growth.
Meanwhile, the economy is still not firing on all cylinders. Housing sector-related data is still quite weak. While mortgage interest rates have declined meaningfully, and home purchase restrictions continue to be loosened, income growth will likely recover with a lag. It still continues to be a question of confidence in the sector, lack of certainty over future price increases and concern over the health of developers are keeping many would-be buyers on the sidelines. Given the considerable debt burden among almost all property developers, regulators are encouraging financial institutions to meet reasonable liquidity demand from developers. Nonetheless, a sector-wide recovery will likely take time, given the continued de-leveraging trend. The manufacturing sector stands to benefit significantly from an end to Zero COVID and rolling lockdowns, but demand from consumers in developed markets could slow more in 2H 2023, in our view. Export data is also weakening at a rapid pace. Recent manufacturing PMIs suggest that consumer demand from developed markets is still slowing. Lastly, the labor market is at the early stages of recovery. On the one hand, re-opening has led to some labor shortages in coastal cities, and in manufacturing hubs employers are asking for earlier return to work. On the other hand, companies in growth sectors like healthcare, clean energy and smart manufacturing generally have cautious hiring plans.
As we head into the official policy planning season, there will be more chatter around the macro policy stance and GDP targets for 2023. We expect the government to maintain a similarly expansionary fiscal policy stance this year, as they did in 2022, but mostly to support local governments in an environment of dwindling land sales. In addition, as the government has shifted into a more pro-growth stance, we will likely see some easing of regulations, as evidenced by recent relaxations in the internet space.
All in all, recent data suggest that economic growth has likely bottomed this winter and may start to sequentially improve in the months ahead. We expect a service sector-led recovery, which may be partly offset by stagnant housing market activity and a weakening export outlook. Overall, policies will likely stay supportive, with a focus on easing sector regulations.
Investment Implications
Following the equity rally, many are now questioning what to do next? We retain our constructive view on both offshore and onshore Chinese markets
due to modest valuation re-rating potential, and a consumer-led consumption recovery that has the potential to drive earnings upgrades. Our preference remains towards both the Consumer Discretionary and Communication sectors, which are key beneficiaries of China consumption recovery with the country’s full re-opening. After the robust rally over the past three months, we prefer names with re-opening themes linked to HK/Macau or Europe (instead of just domestic re-opening), where we see further upside to earnings, or laggards to play catch-up.
On the Renminbi (RMB) as we laid out in a
recent piece
, we have a stable outlook on the exchange rate (USDCNY) from here. The currency recently had strong support from improved sentiment thanks to the rapid reopening and capital inflows as global portfolios close their large underweights in Chinese assets. We expect portfolio inflows to moderately continue, however, we are wary that the negative carry against the dollar and risks of further deterioration in the balance of payments could continue to pose pressure. As the slowdown in goods demand from U.S. and European consumers continues, China’s exports will likely deteriorate from the high teens growth of the past two years to a significant contraction this year. At the same time, current account outflows could see a boost if outbound tourism resumes. Given this confluence of factors and how fast the RMB has moved, we don’t favor long RMB as a way to express the China reopening theme. For dollar-based investors looking to add exposure to RMB-denominated assets (i.e. onshore Chinese equities), one strategy could be to hedge out FX risks and lock in a positive carry.All market and economic data as of February 9, 2023 and sourced from Bloomberg Finance L.P. and FactSet unless otherwise stated.

RISK CONSIDERATIONS
Investments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities, particularly if the instruments involve leverage. The value of commodity-linked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements, commodity index volatility, changes in interest rates, or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity, such as drought, floods, weather, livestock disease, embargoes, tariffs and international economic, political and regulatory developments. Use of leveraged commodity-linked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but, at the same time, creates the possibility for greater loss.​
Holders of foreign securities can be subject to foreign exchange risk, exchange-rate risk and currency risk, as exchange rates fluctuate between an investment’s foreign currency and the investment holder’s domestic currency. Conversely, it is possible to benefit from favorable foreign exchange fluctuations.

Our Top Market Takeaways for January 20, 2023.
Market update
When bad news isn’t good news
Stocks sank and bonds rallied as soft-landing hopes gave way to recession fears.
Heading into Friday, the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq were down more than -2%, while 10-year U.S. Treasury yields have now fallen -45 basis points just in the first three weeks of the year. That said, stocks outside the United States continued to hold their ground—both Europe and China were flat to slightly higher on the week.
The culprits:
Slowing growth. Despite last week’s optimism around decelerating inflation, investors seem spooked that growth is becoming scarcer. Retail sales fell by more than expected as consumers felt the pinch, and factory output showed the weakest quarter for manufacturing since the start of the pandemic.
Federal Reserve hawkishness. The Fed doesn’t seem swayed by the latest data, even if it’s moving its way. A host of Fed speakers this week signaled their intention to keep hiking. In their minds, while a slowdown in the pace of hikes might be warranted, the job isn’t done: Inflation is still too high, and even as growth slows, the labor market remains too tight (new applications for unemployment benefits are at their lowest since September).
Cautious words from corporates. So far, Q4 earnings season has been better than expected—but that is off a low bar (it’s expected to be the weakest for the S&P 500 since 2020). The cautious commentary coming from management teams has been hard to ignore. Moreover, job cuts in tech continued this week as Microsoft and Alphabet both announced more layoffs.
But we’d be remiss not to mention there were a few bright spots:
Producers are seeing lower prices on their products—a sign that goods inflation continues to decelerate. The Producer Price Index fell -0.5% in December, down from +0.3% in November.
Mortgage rates have fallen 1% from their peak (for 30-year fixed, to 6.37% from 7.35%), catalyzing the largest weekly jump in applications since 2020. Housing starts for single-family homes also saw their first gain in four months.
We’re at a pivot point, and markets are trying to work out the path forward. And if the state of the economy didn’t bring enough to digest, political conflict around the debt ceiling is also unfolding in Washington—with much at risk. Below, we answer five questions on what could be a messy government showdown.
Your questions, our answers
Debt ceiling drama
The U.S. government hit its legal $31.4 trillion debt limit yesterday. From here, the Treasury (which is responsible for the government’s pocketbook) is expected to run down its cash balance and use “extraordinary measures” as long as it feasibly can to help the government continue to pay its obligations. But those measures won’t last forever—by our estimates, the runway should last until at least June—and Congress is faced with overcoming political gridlock to address the ceiling before the clock runs out.
The punchline:
We will likely see heightened market volatility around these deadlines this year, but if history is any guide, we expect policymakers to eventually find a compromise and the impact to be short-lived. The key is to focus on your long-term investment plan.
1. What’s the debt limit? How does this all work?
Everyone has bills to pay, including the U.S. government. To meet its obligations (which include paying military salaries, retiree benefits, interest on national debt, etc.), the Treasury sells bonds (i.e., issues new debt) to investors across the globe. Because the U.S. government consistently runs a budget deficit (meaning it spends more than it takes in), the Treasury issues even more debt to pay its outstanding obligations, and as a result, the stock of national debt has continued to rise.But the so-called debt limit designates the maximum amount the U.S. government can ultimately borrow. Today, that limit stands at $31.4 trillion. Some form of a debt cap has been in place since 1917, and since WWII, the ceiling has been raised or suspended 102 times—the last time being 2021.
2. What happens next?
Now that we hit the limit, the Treasury will run down its cash balance at the Fed and use “extraordinary measures” to keep expenditures flowing (through fancy accounting that limits some government investments and reduces the amount of debt subject to the limit). That runway is broadly estimated to last until at least June, but there is a lot of uncertainty around that date.
Congress is in charge of suspending or raising the limit, and the next few months will likely see members from both political parties demand concessions as they try to negotiate a deal.
3. But what if the government can’t get it done?
If Congress does not suspend or raise the limit, the risk of default becomes a reality. We would expect the Treasury to prioritize paying its debt obligations, while curbing its discretionary expenditures (like education or transportation). The impact could be economically calamitous (through a potential global recession) and disruptive for investors (for instance, through persistently higher Treasury borrowing costs).
That said, history is on our side that policymakers will reach a consensus to avoid a worst-case scenario of default.
4. What have markets done in past episodes of debt ceiling drama?
The closest call in the recent past was in 2011, when Congress increased the ceiling just two days before the Treasury was expected to exhaust its efforts. Days later, Standard & Poor’s downgraded the U.S. credit rating to AA+ (from AAA). Risk assets reacted negatively: The dollar sold off, stocks sank and credit spreads widened, but a strong rally in Treasuries (driven by other percolating market fears at the time, such as the European sovereign debt crisis) led bonds higher overall.Outside of 2011, other recent instances have seen markets more driven by the prevailing economic and market dynamics of the time, and any volatility around debt ceiling drama was ultimately short-lived.
Policymakers eventually found a compromise in all of these instances.
5. Can I do anything to prepare for a disorderly episode?
Diversification is the best defense. The potential for a disorderly debt ceiling episode adds just another kicker for global investors to rebalance U.S. overweights across asset classes—a key point expressed in our
2023 Outlook
.
For instance, consider currencies and precious metals such as the Japanese yen and Swiss franc, and gold. Further, yields globally have risen, with bonds outside of the United States also now providing compelling income and protection. Finally, while stocks globally could take a hit in a disorderly episode, high-quality international equities (which are already catching a bid from China’s reopening, Europe’s improving energy dynamics, and higher exposure to the real economy) could provide relative insulation.
All in all, this isn’t the first time a debt ceiling episode has caused drama for investors, and it probably won’t be the last. Through the noise, we think it’s best to stick with your long-term investment plan.All market and economic data as of January 2023 and sourced from Bloomberg Finance L.P. and FactSet unless otherwise stated.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Market volatility may impact the health of your life insurance policy. Here’s how U.S. clients can evaluate whether their policy might need a check-up.Current market conditions can impact your life insurance, giving you a different outcome than you might have expected.
Recent volatility has impacted nearly every aspect of investment portfolios. But you may not be thinking about how it impacts your permanent life insurance policy. While a decline in your investment portfolio can be worrisome, those same investment losses in certain permanent life insurance policies can lead to issues that can affect how much you pay in premiums or how long your policy will last.
In this article, we’ll look at how market changes can impact your policy and some steps you can take to help ensure that your life insurance policy will continue to meet your needs. And even if you don’t have this kind of policy, it is good practice to conduct an annual life insurance policy review to make sure it aligns with the rest of your wealth planning strategy.
Why and how does the market impact my life insu­­rance policy?
Back when you purchased your life insurance policy, you were presented with an illustration showing how your policy’s cash value, death benefit or other benefits would grow based on certain assumptions, such as how much premium you’ll pay and an expected growth rate based on interest rates or market performance. But over time, the market conditions that drive your policy’s growth may not act as expected. Equity markets don’t always perform as anticipated, interest rates can go up or down, and volatility can cause disruption. In short,
life insurance policies are predicated on assumptions, and actual performance can vary.
How do those assumptions affect a policy?
According to the Life Insurance Marketing and Research Association (LIMRA), 58% of all life insurance policies issued in 2021 were variable, indexed or whole life policies, which are types of policies with performance that is based on underlying assumptions.
1
Regardless of the type of life insurance policy you have, the premiums you pay and ­­­how many years the policy remains in force can be affected by these assumptions. Specifically:
Whole life policies
are based on dividends that are loosely tied to interest rates. Over the past two decades, many life insurers have seen reductions in their dividends. Lower dividends can impact how long you have to pay premiums, how much cash value will accrue, and potentially how large your death benefit will be.
Indexed universal life policies
are based on index returns that include both a cap (limiting your upside potential) and a floor (limiting your downside risk). These assumptions are predicated on options’ pricing and stock market index returns. Lower interest rates typically reduce the carriers options budget (how the cap and floor are determined), which can result in lower cap rates, which further limit your growth potential. In addition, market volatility has caused some investments to underperform, resulting in lower cash values.
Variable universal life policies
are based on stock market returns, which can be volatile.  Because variable universal life policy illustrations assume static returns, they do not account for volatility. This means the illustration you saw initially may not line up with stock market reality.
How different might reality be than the assumptions used in the illustration?
John, a 45-year-old male, received an illustration for a permanent life insurance policy with a $1,000,000 benefit, and a planned annual premium of $13,200 for the first 10 years of the contract. The illustration assumes an 8% straight-line return over the life of the product.  Accordingly, the estimated cash value of the policy at certain ages is as follows:However, we know from history that markets don’t work like clockwork. When you add variability in the return sequence, the estimated cash value will vary over time, increasing the likelihood that the cash value could be depleted over time. And here’s why that matters: When the cash value is depleted, the policy will lapse if no additional premiums, often significant, are made.
If we use the same assumptions for John’s illustration, but simply vary the return year-to-year, the impact on the estimated cash value is quite different:The graph is based on J.P. Morgan Long-Term Capital Market Assumptions (LTCMAs) for U.S. Large Cap Equity as of January 2023 to most closely match the annualized compound return of 8% used in the straight-line analysis above. We overlayed the LTCMAs U.S. Large Cap Equity volatility assumption and simulated over 5,000 different potential market experiences to determine the likelihood of the cash value of the policy being greater than $0 over time.
A policy review can help alleviate these types of issues
Having your J.P. Morgan team conduct a life insurance policy review can help you evaluate if your policy is performing up to expectations and if it still works in harmony with the rest of your wealth plan. For example, a policy review can:
Help you see if aspects of your current policy may be impacted by market volatility or interest rate changes, such as cap rates and policy duration.
Stress test your policy against various market conditions and assumptions to ensure your policy can hold up in different environments.
Encourage you to work with your provider for recommendations to get you back on track, such as increasing your premiums to offset performance issues or exchanging your policy to prevent a shortfall of cash value and the subsequent lapse of the death benefit.
Allow you to explore other policies in the market today, as features, benefits and costs change over time.
You don’t need market volatility to conduct a policy review
Even if you don’t have a policy with performance that is tied to the market, an annual life insurance policy review is a good practice. That’s because a policy review can help you:
Ensure that your policy still aligns with your goals.
When your goals change, your policy may need to change as well. Or sometimes the reason you bought life insurance simply doesn’t exist anymore.
Adjust as the insurance industry evolves.
As life expectancies increase, underlying costs of insurance have decreased, so there may be an opportunity for you to lower your premium. This, in conjunction with new policy types, can lead to improvements in contracts that may be more efficient for different types of planning that may not have existed when you bought your policy.
Evaluate the health of your policy.
Is your policy performing as expected? For example, if you thought you’d have a certain death benefit amount at this point in time and market declines have cut into those gains, you may need to make adjustments.
Make changes sooner rather than later.
If your policy isn’t performing as expected, you can reallocate assets or make other changes to get it back on track.
Confirm that the policy’s ownership and named beneficiary are correct.
People often purchase life insurance for estate tax purposes, but how the policy is set up can affect your taxes. So it’s wise to make sure your policy’s ownership is set up so that you don’t accidentally create a tax liability.
We can help
You’re not alone in navigating the markets and evaluating how different factors might affect your life insurance policy.
Your J.P. Morgan team can conduct a life insurance policy review to help ensure your policy continues to meet your goals.
In the best of circumstances, a policy review can confirm that your policy is performing as you thought it would. This means you can relax, knowing it continues to align with your goals.

The illustration assumes an 8% straight-line return over the life of the product. Accordingly, the estimated cash value of the policy at certain ages is as follows: Age 70: $355,923; Age 80: $608,720; Age 90: $1,108,147; Age 100: $2,175,826.This graph shows the likelihood that the cash value in a permanent life insurance policy would be depleted by a certain age, assuming a randomized return path for the cash value component. The analysis assumes a 45-year-old male funds a policy with a premium that would keep the policy in force well past life expectancy when illustrated with a straight-line return of 8%. Under these assumptions, with a randomized return sequence, the likelihood that the cash value is depleted over time is as follows: Age 70: 10–15%; Age 80: 50–55%; Age 90: 80–85%; Age 100: 80–85%. While the straight-line illustration forecasted approximately $1.1 million in cash value at age 90, using varying returns shows that the policy has a very high probability of the cash value being $0, which would cause the policy to lapse and the death benefit to be forfeited.Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.

Our Top Market Takeaways for February 10, 2023
Market update
The push and pull
Investors continue to feel the push and pull of an economy in transition. In all, U.S. stocks stand to end the week lower, and bond yields have risen roughly back to where they started the year.
Here’s what we learned:
Say what you want to say, but without saying what you want to say.
This week saw a flurry of Federal Reserve speakers, with the main event from Chair Powell on Tuesday. Powell largely stuck to his script—disinflation has been promising, but there is a long way to go, and more hikes aren’t off the table. But it’s what he didn’t say that mattered most: Despite last Friday’s blockbuster jobs report (which saw the U.S. economy add another 517,000 jobs in January), Powell didn’t suggest the Fed needed to hike above the 5.15% markets already expect. Read: Rates are already restrictive, and the economy should continue to feel it.
Returning to normal?
U.S. jobless claims rose for the first time since December. While the unemployment rate is at a historically low 3.4%, a tick up in claims suggests that the overwhelming demand for workers has a chance of coming back in balance with labor supply. Read: The labor market is still super tight, but is starting to move in the Fed’s direction.
Not terrible, not terrific.
Q4 earnings reports this week echoed that mixed sentiment. Disney beat estimates, but saw poor streaming numbers and announced a round of layoffs to cut costs. Ride-hailing company Lyft missed expectations and said it expects fewer riders, while its rival Uber saw shares bounce on strong demand for rides and food delivery. A relative bright spot came from Pepsi, which showed the power of its brand and pricing power. Read: Corporates are holding up, but also showing the slowdown.
But while U.S. markets wobbled, European stocks continued their climb. In dollar terms, the European market is on track for its seventh consecutive week in the green. Is the tide turning for Europe? Today’s
Top Market Takeaways
digs into five reasons why we think there might be cause for more optimism.
Spotlight
The case for Europe, in 5 reasons
Defying all odds, the outlook for Europe has continued to brighten.
Here are five reasons we think the tide is turning.
1) Growth has been much better than expected
—So much so that leading indicators are signalling expansion again.
While the region seemed to be teetering on the edge of recession heading into winter, improving energy dynamics have staved off the contraction most thought was inevitable. Thanks to a heroic effort to rebuild natural gas reserves and a milder than anticipated winter, natural gas prices have fallen by over 80% and are back at levels from before the war in Ukraine started. Europe looks to exit winter with better gas reserves (~50% of capacity) than it would even in a normal year (~30%). What’s more, Europe stands to reap tailwinds from China’s rapid reopening, given the economies’ trade linkages.Finally, better still is that headline inflation looks like it’s slowing its roll—though we’d note the combination of still elevated prices and better growth are likely to keep the European Central Bank hiking for now.
2) All those good vibes translate into more resilient earnings.
Banks largely reported stellar profits, lower gas prices have been a boon for industrials companies such as Infineon, energy companies such as BP are increasing capex for new projects, and luxury brands such as LVMH seem to be going from strength to strength.
Looking ahead, improved growth should boost sales, particularly as the Chinese consumer gets back in action. For instance, while Asia only accounted for ~11% of Stoxx Europe 600 revenues in 2010, it now represents more than 20%. Moreover, moderating prices should continue to ease some margin pressures.3) We don’t think it’s all priced in.
Even with an over 20% rally from the lows, we think there could be more room to run. European stocks are trading at a 13x forward price-to-earnings ratio, below its 14.5x 10-year average. We also expect Europe’s discount to the United States to continue to narrow. It was at a historically wide 30% before this rally and has closed to ~26% today, and we expect it to finish the year closer to 20%.4) But it’s not just a short-term story—Europe is home to some of the growth trends of tomorrow.
This isn’t the same old Europe. The European market has seen its sector makeup shift from inherently lower growth industries such as telecoms and banks toward higher-quality companies such as luxury goods and semiconductors. Further, as the pandemic and war exposed supply-side vulnerabilities, we believe a capex cycle focused on developing the real economy is underway (think supply chain resiliency, energy and food security, infrastructure and defense)—in stark departure from the era of low interest rates that fueled mega cap tech in the last cycle. Such a shift could benefit Europe’s higher weighting to industrials, materials and energy versus its U.S. peers.
5) A weaker dollar adds an extra kicker for U.S. investors.
The U.S. dollar has weakened ~10% from its highs as U.S. inflation has cooled, other developed world central banks have caught up to the Fed’s rate hikes, and growth outside the United States has markedly improved. Meanwhile, the euro has rallied, and the dynamics above should also give it further support. That means USD-based investors could see even more enhanced returns when investing in European assets. For example, since the start of October, the Stoxx Europe 600 has generated a compelling ~20% return in local currency terms, but an even higher ~30% in dollars!
Investment implications
Think outside the box
Europe accounts for only ~3% of U.S. investors’ total equity allocation, despite accounting for ~20% of the global equity universe; 2022 was also one of the worst years for flows out of European equities in the last decade. Many investors are underweight Europe, and looking ahead, while there remain risks around the war and the evolving business cycle, we believe the latest green shoots warrant a closer look.
In the multi-asset portfolios we manage, we’ve been increasing exposure. Some might also consider adding to broad markets with downside protection through structured notes. We likewise see opportunity in Europe’s national leaders across luxury, semiconductors and energy—many of which are aligned with policymakers’ priorities and may also provide stability in the face of any further volatility.
That said, at the same time, stresses remain, and a window appears to be opening for investors with expertise in special situations to acquire assets at a discount, and to restructure troubled credit and real estate. Such strategies can generate yield and offer diversification if things go the other way.

Tom McGraw, Head of Tax Advisory, Advice Lab
The demand for private aircraft has surged the last few years since the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Indeed, demand remained elevated throughout 2022 despite stock market volatility, inflation, and geopolitical issues, and we have been inundated with calls from clients asking about their best options to own and fly privately.
Our best advice: It’s more important now than ever to be an informed aviation consumer. Be sure to know your ownership options, the realities of the current market, what tax deductions there may (or may not) be, and how your desire to own a plane meshes with your other financial goals.
Know what type of buyer you are
First, what form of ownership interests you?
If you think you might like to own the plane by yourself, we suggest pinpointing your reasons. Knowing your “why” will help you to assign an economic value to the goal of airplane ownership. It’s also wise to be clear about just how motivated you are, so you can better weigh this goal against the costs of a plane in light of your other financial priorities.
So, do you want to own a plane primarily because you:
Want to use your time more efficiently?
By far the biggest benefit of private aviation and the reason most people opt to own their own planes is that it saves time and effort. For example, in one day, an executive could fly to meetings in three different cities and still be home for dinner that evening—a feat that likely would be impossible with commercial air travel.
Have a passion for airplanes?
A small number of plane buyers are like car, horse and yacht enthusiasts. They’ve loved aviation since childhood and want to get involved not only in owning, but also running (and potentially even flying) their aircraft.
Are interested in the experience?
COVID-19 has dramatically increased the number of people interested in private aviation because flying alone is inherently safer, health-wise. Also, flying private through providers that have brand affiliations can provide unique access to “money can’t buy” experiences and events. But, do note: To enjoy these benefits, it is often unnecessary to take on the full burden of owning and running an aircraft. If you are this kind of buyer, charters or fractional ownership may be your better choices.
Demand for aircraft is high, so inventory is very low
After “know thyself,” comes “know the market,” and we continue to unquestionably be in a seller’s market: There is a limited supply, higher prices and significantly longer wait times for new planes.
The reasons are clear: Demand for private aviation stayed consistently high through 2021 and 2022. U.S. business jet flight activity was up 15% in December 2022 over December 2019’s pre-pandemic  levels
1
. The increase was largely in shared aircraft usage, with charter and fractional up 27% and 26%, respectively.
The major business jet manufacturers have been prioritizing growing their backlogs and maintaining pricing discipline. They remain cautious about heavily increasing production, due to supply-chain challenges and lessons learned from previous cycles in which demand spikes led to oversupply.Bottom line: As the chart below shows, asking prices for used airplanes have gone up 11% to as much as 43% due to this higher flight activity, COVID-19 concerns, limited inventory and lack of supply from manufacturers. And wait times are now running anywhere from 12 to 30 months for new planes.Purchasing and operating a plane are always costly propositions. However, given that they are particularly expensive now, we’re emphasizing to our clients the need to engage in a thoughtful process.
Buying an aircraft is a process
Our advice is always that clients recognize they’re not making a single decision (i.e., to buy a plane). Typically, they are making as many as three decisions: finding the right plane, structuring the purchase and running that plane.
To make decisions that best suit your needs always requires thought and consultation with the right people. It’s wise to get input from your family decision makers as well as a broker/consultant, aviation attorney, accountant, financing provider and charter/management company.
Many of our clients ask trusted family members or leaders in their family offices to handle this process—which, given current market conditions, can now take two to three months of nearly full-time attention. They’ll need to identify the right aircraft, structure the acquisition to suit the family’s goals, and hire the right partner to run the aircraft day-to-day.Look carefully at potential tax benefits (or lack thereof)
It is particularly important that you consult with your tax advisor.
We generally recommend against making any move solely for tax purposes. That is as true for airplane buying as it is for any other major purchases, investing, charitable giving and other financial decisions.
You’ll also want to be careful not to assume that tax benefits will help defray all your costs of buying and owning a plane. And, if you are a business principal and think that a plane will help you shelter business as well as other sources of income, think again (particularly if business use is not the sole or predominant purpose of the aircraft).
Yes, there are potential tax advantages (bonus depreciation, interest expense deductibility) if you use an airplane predominantly or exclusively  for business purposes, and if those business purposes are well supported and documented scrupulously.
There can be potential limitations to those tax deductions if you or related parties use a business plane for personal flights to any significant degree. Business entertainment as a flight’s primary purpose no longer qualifies as business use. And the rules on leasing to third parties are complex.
Also note that starting in 2023, the bonus depreciation benefits will gradually shrink by 20% each year
2
, until they disappear entirely after 2026. There is a one year delay of this bonus depreciation phaseout generally applicable for certain aircraft placed in service and operated by an owner for its own business use.  The sunsetting of the depreciation tax break generally starting this  year seems to be adding fuel to the current, already outsized demand to buy a plane soon.
We can help
If you are thinking about buying a private jet, do not hesitate to ask your J.P. Morgan team for help in thinking through this important purchase. We can help you understand how airplane ownership might impact any of the other goals you have for your wealth. And if you decide to go ahead, we can help you make sure your
liquidity
and
lifestyle
buckets are funded and invested to support this goal.1

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.And historically, there’s been a reward for staying the course in the asset class.It’s time to look more closely at private growth equity.
Valuations of high-growth companies were knocked down in both the public and private markets in 2022 as growth hit a cyclical speed bump.
But innovation-driven secular growth plays out over the long term, and private growth equity can offer unique access to these megatrends.
As valuations stabilize and private market activity begins to pick up, managers may have the opportunity to buy high-quality companies at more attractive valuations and with improved investment terms. You may be able to upgrade your private growth equity portfolio with rare open capacity at well-established managers.
Here’s what we’re seeing in the private growth equity market—and why you may want to pay particular attention to it now.
Coming back to the market
In recent years, historically low interest rates helped drive record growth and valuations across high-growth areas of the economy, such as the technology sector.
But as interest rates rose sharply in 2022, equity valuations fell—particuarly for high-growth companies.
1
While the reaction was immediate in the public markets, markdowns of Private companies started in the second half of 2022. We expect these markdowns will continue for several quarters.
However, this correction is within our expectations for this point in the growth equity cycle (i.e., coming off the peak of a long bull market). And we seem to be closer now to the bottom of the cycle than the peak. One sign: Private market activity has slowed dramatically. Equity issuance has declined significantly, and the market for initial public offerings (IPOs) has been largely frozen for over a year. For example, in the U.S. stock market, there were 1,035 IPOs in 2021 versus 181 IPOs in 2022.
Private market activity may pick up again soon. Many companies had enough cash to avoid raising money in the challenging environment of 2022, but we expect many will have to come back to the market in the second and third quarters of 2023. This new fundraising activity will reveal what investors are willing to pay for growth in the current environment, and should help valuations find a new base.
General improvement in macro conditions, such as stabilizing or lower inflation, a pause in interest rate hikes or decreasing geopolitical risks, also would likely improve investor sentiment and could boost activity in the private markets.
Finding the opportunities
As private market activity picks up, we expect to see potential opportunities at every level of the investment process.
At the company level, we see potential in the relatively strong businesses fundamentals of early and growth stage businesses (in terms of scale, recurring revenues and high margins) relative to the last two big downturns. During the 2008–2009 financial crisis and the dot-com crash in 2001, high-growth companies were often smaller and sometimes valued on dubious metrics, such as “eyeballs,” rather than financials.
We do expect to see divergence in company performance. Companies with the strongest fundamentals may have the greatest chances of attracting the most capital and top talent, enabling further growth; those with weaker prospects may not survive. In turn, fund managers will seek to deploy capital where they have conviction, looking to take advantage of both lower valuations and better terms, which may ultimately lead to higher returns in their portfolios.
You may have opportunities to benefit even more directly. For example, with the drop in public equity valuations, some institutional investors may opt to sell private equity positions and reduce future commitments as they rebalance their portfolios, opening up the potential for you to buy rare capacity with experienced managers via both primary fund commitments and secondary strategies.
It also may surprise you to learn that correction era vintages have historically produced some of the strongest returns.
2
Exposure to these vintages may help balance out investments in 2019–2021 vintage funds, which will likely be impacted by their exposure to top-of-cycle valuations.
But timing cycles is extremely difficult for even the most sophisticated investors, which is why you may want to consider systematically diversifying private growth investments by vintage.
Tapping into megatrends and long-term growth
Buying into a company earlier in its lifecycle has historically contributed to greater value creation in private markets than public markets over time. Given the volatility inherent in younger, more rapidly growing businesses, as well as the long-term nature of company-building, investing in the category requires a long-term horizon.
In our view, some of the the most exciting innovations and strongest growth trends are occurring in industries where many well-regarded, fast-growing or pure-play companies are still private. These include:
Continued penetration and growth of cloud-based software, also known as Software-as-a-Service (or “SaaS”), a market that is expected to be $917 billion by 2025
3
Next-gen artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies applied to automation and human assistance (e.g., ChatGPT)
Internet platform-driven businesses that can scale globally from day one
Continued penetration of ecommerce, which currently comprises only ~15% of U.S. retail sales
4
Growing global cybersecurity needs in line with the world’s rapidly expanding digital footprint (i.e., as the digital surface area continues to grow, so does the need to secure it from bad actors)
New consumer brands capturing changing consumer preferences and taking share from legacy incumbents
These are long-term trends. Combined with volatility, a changing macroeconomic environment and the process of building a company, investing in private growth equity requires a long time horizon, and potential returns typically come back over time.
We can help
Private growth equity is a way to participate in the megatrends that could potentially drive substantial economic growth over the next decade. Investments in young, rapidly growing businesses come with volatility and risks along the way; they also may result in a wider range of potential outcomes—from bankruptcies to highly successful IPOs.
Speak with your J.P. Morgan team to assess whether private growth equity suits your long-term goals. They can help you size your allocation so that it matches your appetite for risk and time horizon.

Interest rates are the most meaningful input for the discount rate used to value future cash flows in standard equity valuation models. A higher discount rate results in a lower valuation. Valuations of high-growth companies are more severely impacted because their cash flows tend to be further in the future.

A study by Cambridge Associates, a global investment consultant, tracked 25 mature (over five years old) growth equity vintages and found that 100% of the top five vintages and 80% of top 10 vintages are from years when the growth-oriented NASDAQ stock index was down or declined in the following two years.

Online dating apps have made it so much easier to make a connection. But scammers are also online—preying on people’s desire to meet
the one
and tricking them into cyber sweetheart relationships while draining their funds.
Since the pandemic, romance scams have steadily increased, according to a recent report by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).
1
Many scams disproportionately target individuals over 60, who represented 32% of all victims in 2021; individuals in the 30–50-plus age group embodied approximately 15%.
How the scams play out
A typical romance scam begins with the creation of a fake online identity. Once the fraudster makes a connection with a potential target, they endeavor to appear genuine, caring and attentive. Usually, the relationship evolves very quickly as the scammer seeks to gain the target’s trust, paving the way for fraud to occur.
The first red flag may be a request for funds. Often, fraudsters will fabricate a reason to ask for money—and if they sense vulnerability, the amount may increase with each request. Common inducements are: paying for medical emergencies, travel expenses (supposedly to visit), or investment opportunities. Once their victims agree to send money, fraudsters specify how they wish to receive the funds. Requests for payment via wire transfers, payment apps or cryptocurrencies are typical.
Fraudsters exploit the premise of the relationship in an attempt to trick victims—and a significant amount of money may be at risk. According to the latest FBI report,
in 2021, victims of online confidence fraud and romance scams reported more than $956 million in losses, a 60% increase over 2020—and a 101% increase since 2019.
2
Five ways to protect your loved ones
1.
Conduct due diligence.
Look into the identity of any individual who approaches you or a family member online.
2.
Be instinctual.
Pay attention to red flags, such as inconsistencies in information shared, excuses to not meet in person—or via video chat—and especially any requests for money or information about the value of financial holdings. Be wary if things seem too good to be true.
3.
Safeguard personal information.
Don’t answer probing questions about financial circumstances, and never share details such as bank account numbers, trusted contact details or login credentials.
4.
Protect assets.
Do not send any money anywhere without a thorough review of the person who is going to receive it. Safeguard financial accounts—and encourage your family members to do so, too—by creating strong login credentials and enabling notification alerts about any unauthorized activity.
5.
Reduce exposure.
Help your loved ones minimize their
digital profiles: Details shared on social media and online platforms may give fraudsters enough information to target and trick.
Remember, fraudsters count on the power of shame to prevent their victims from reporting romantic scams. Assure any family member or friend who may be the victim of romantic deception that they are not alone—and have nothing to be embarrassed about. Many people do find love through online connections. But it’s like dating in any setting: Take it slow and verify before you trust.
We can help
If you believe you (or your loved ones) may have been targeted in any kind of online scam,
freeze your credit
and speak with your J.P. Morgan team immediately.

While taxes are inevitable, what you may owe might not be. That’s why we suggest you meet with your tax advisors as soon as possible to finalize your 2022 returns—and plan for 2023.
Often, your tax bill depends on a number of fluid factors, including: where you live, how old you are, what (and to whom) you give and whether you can (and do) benefit from available tax breaks.
But this year, you may be affected by some recently passed legislation. We suggest you speak with your tax advisors now to explore which of these 13 actions may suit your situation.
What might you do now about your 2022 tax bill?
Here are five actions to consider for your 2022 returns. Which work for you?With a traditional IRA, you can contribute up to $6,000, or—if you were 50 years or older in 2022—up to $7,000 of your earned income. Moreover, those contributions are potentially deductible and, even if not, may be used for conversions to Roth IRAs and possibly doubled via a contribution for a non-working spouse.
With a Roth IRA, subject to certain limitations, you can make non-deductible contributions up to the same limits for 2022 with the benefit that all growth, and future distributions, will generally be tax-free.
1
If you own a business that offers SEP or SIMPLE IRAs to employees, you have a grace period for making contributions to those accounts, based on the due date of the business’s or employer’s tax return, including extensions.Trustees and executors have until March 6, 2023, to distribute income to beneficiaries and have those distributions treated as if they were made in 2022.
If a trustee has discretion over whether to make a distribution, the decision must be informed, always, by (a) the terms of the trust, (b) the trust’s income and transfer tax characteristics, and (c) the beneficiary’s best interests.
Only after weighing those factors should a trustee determine whether a distribution would make economic sense—as it often does. The marginal U.S. income tax rate of many trust beneficiaries (including even some whose income exceeds $500,000) is well below the top 37% tax rate, which is generally the rate that the trust would pay, as the tax brackets for trusts are compressed, at very low levels.
2The Internal Revenue Service issued a notice late in 2020 stating that it intends to issue regulations saying pass-through entities (e.g., partnerships and S corporations) are exempt from the $10,000 deductibility cap on state and local taxes (SALT) at the entity level.
Check your state laws to determine whether pass-through entities in that state can elect to use this deduction. (Not all entities can or would want to make this election.) Many states require elections by March 15 for calendar year partnerships and such elections apply only to future tax returns.Have you directly (or indirectly, through a pass-through entity such as a partnership) realized short- or long-term gains during the last few months of the year on the sale of an asset? If so, you may have 180 days from the date of that realization (as determined under special QOF rules) to invest those gains in a QOF and defer (perhaps for several years) payment of taxes that would otherwise be due.
If you own an interest or shares in a pass-through entity that sold an asset early in 2022, the date of realization for that sale may be December 31 or March 15.
3
Speak with your tax advisors to determine what the relevant date of realization is, and how to measure the 180-day period in your circumstances.The general rule is that, to avoid penalties, private non-operating foundations must distribute at least 5% of their assets at least annually to public charities. But if needed, you may have as many as 12 additional months to make distributions, as there is, in effect, a 12-month grace period.
In other words, a private foundation with a December 31 fiscal year that is determined to have $1 million of assets and therefore a minimum distribution requirement of $50,000 as of December 31, 2022, has until December 31, 2023, to distribute that $50,000. A Donor Advised Fund (DAF) can be the recipient of the required distribution amount.
Check with your tax advisor to see what your private foundation’s final deadline for these distributions may be if the foundation’s situation requires more time.How will you pay your tax bill by the April deadline?
While tax
returns
are often filed on extension, tax
payments
must, in all but the rarest of circumstances, be made by the April deadline. So you may want, or need, to raise cash to make that payment. If that’s the case, what are your options?Borrowing against your portfolio of marketable securities is a handy solution. Of course, borrowing has a cost. However, even though interest rates are higher, the cost to you may be relatively small. Indeed, the cost may be far outweighed by other considerations (such as not having to sell securities or other assets you’d prefer to keep—especially if you expect an influx of cash in the relatively near future).
You can’t deduct the interest on funds you borrow to pay taxes—but you can deduct the interest if you’re borrowing to invest, to the extent of investment income. So you might want to borrow to invest, and deduct the interest paid on those borrowings, meanwhile using cash from other sources to pay your taxes.
If you don’t want to borrow, review your holdings: If your portfolio has both unrealized gains and losses, consider selling holdings that would produce no net capital gains and using the proceeds to pay the taxes due.This year’s changes
There are some issues and opportunities particular to this year that you may want to consider as soon as possible:The amounts you can contribute to your 401(k) account increased in 2023 to $22,500 if you are under age 50, or $30,000 if you are over 50. Also: the combined amount your employer and you can contribute has risen to $66,000 or $73,500, respectively, depending on your age.
Further, a law enacted in the last week of 2022 provides that employees may now designate an employer’s matching contributions as Roth contributions, as long as the employee is 100% vested in any employer contributions.
Be sure that the withholdings from your pay are properly calibrated to account for those changes.
These figures also apply to self-employed defined contribution accounts. One new option for SEP and SIMPLE IRAs starting in 2023: Up to 100% of the contribution can be designated as a contribution to a Roth account, which is significant given the higher contribution limits for these plans.
In addition, if you’ll have a bonus (or other performance-based compensation) to set aside in a deferred compensation account, you may have only until June 30 to do so. Check with your employer to confirm your deadlines to make elections and to identify the maximum you might defer under the plan. Then, based on your cash flow needs now and in the future, you can decide what might be the appropriate amount for you to defer.A law enacted in the last week of 2022 increased the RMD age from 72 to 73. This means that if you are turning 72 in 2023 and were expecting to take your first RMD this year, it is no longer necessary. You can start next year.
RMDs don’t have to be taken until December 31. However, if you turned 72 in 2022 and did not take your first RMD by December 31, then you must do so by April 1, 2023.
RMDs are based on two factors you already know—your age, and the balances in your tax-deferred accounts on December 31 of the previous year. But always check with your financial and tax advisors to plan for when you must take your RMDs.
Bond and equity markets were down in 2022. As a result, many taxpayers had to take RMDs from accounts with values that were a lot lower than at the start of the year. Still, we think it generally remains a good idea to wait until the end of the year to take RMDs, because asset values tend to rise.
But before taking your RMD this year, decide whether you want to make a QCD of up to $100,000 to a public charity. A QCD counts toward the RMD amount. (Starting this year, taxpayers can contribute $50,000 of a QCD to charitable remainder trusts or charitable annuities.) And unlike the rest of an RMD, the QCD amount is excluded from your gross income.
But please note: You can’t claim a QCD as an income tax charitable deduction. Also, the QCD cannot be made to a donor-advised fund (DAF) or any kind of private foundation.Despite 2022’s down markets, you likely still hold assets at a gain. It’s extremely tax-wise to donate public equities, in kind, to a public charity (or to a DAF, private operating foundation or private non-operating foundation). Here’s why—in addition to receiving a deduction based on the fair market value of the stock you donate, you also avoid tax on the unrealized gain on those equities.
That said, beware: Make sure you’ve held the donated stock, unhedged, for more than one year. (In rare cases, the holding period may be even longer when securities were received in connection with services performed as a partner for certain profits interests.) Also be sure the financial firm holding your shares donates the correct lot, and if that lot has ever been transferred from another firm, that the basis and holding period information is reported correctly from one firm to the other.Review your actual 2022 and anticipated 2023 tax bills to determine your minimum necessary quarterly estimated payments for this year.
If you are expecting outsized income in 2023, you may want to rely on the actual payments you made in 2022 to determine the estimated payments you make in 2023. This is because the law allows taxpayers to make estimated payments during the course of the year, interest- and penalty-free, up to whichever is lesser: (a) 110% of the prior year’s taxes, or (b) 90% of the current year’s taxes.
Thanks to this rule, you can keep more of your pre-tax income until the tax filing deadline in April of 2024 and invest that income safely—such as in U.S. Treasuries maturing before next April.Many taxpayers have moved since March 2020 in some part for the tax reasons. It requires a great deal of planning (and sometimes headache!) to establish domicile in the state to which you want to pay taxes this year. Ask your J.P. Morgan team for a copy of our
Changing Domicile Checklist
.
Also, it may be easier to switch where trusts that you’ve created are sited for tax purposes (which often differs from where it is sited for trust law purposes), so don’t forget to review those as well.Consider making annual exclusion (up to $17,000 per donor, per donee) gifts earlier in the year so that any growth on these assets over the course of the year occurs off of your balance sheet.Consider implementing a systematic program for harvesting capital losses for your securities portfolios. Doing so might help you to take advantage of any market downturns while avoiding the wash sale rules so adverse to taxpayers—and to bank those losses to offset either already realized, or expected future, capital gains.
4
And while you’re reviewing your portfolio with an eye to harvesting losses, be sure to evaluate the tax efficiency of your holdings across all of your family’s accounts.
A key contributor to growing family wealth over time is making sure the proper accounts own the proper assets. For instance, where possible, have tax-deferred accounts own tax-inefficient assets, and taxable accounts own tax-efficient assets. Asset location can be as important as asset allocation to wealth growth and preservation.We can help
We keep our eyes on potential and enacted tax law changes at both the federal and state levels. We don’t expect the current Congress to pass any laws that would materially affect ordinary income or capital gains tax rates. However, we do expect some action in the next Congress, that is to say in 2025.
And, of course, the states could change their tax rates, as many did effective January 1, 2023.
There are many options you may consider for your 2022 taxes and to prepare for 2023 and beyond. Your J.P. Morgan team can assist in working with your tax advisors to help decide which options are the best suited for you.

The maximum a taxpayer may contribute directly to a Roth IRA is reduced, potentially to $0, if modified adjusted gross income is above certain thresholds. In addition, for all growth and distributions to be tax-free, taxpayers must meet certain requirements. See
www.irs.gov
for details based on your specific tax filing status.
2
The top rate of 37% would apply to 2023 income in excess of $14,450 accumulated by a non-grantor trust. By contrast, the top 37% rate is reached by married taxpayers filing jointly only once income exceeds $693,750.
3
The date of realization for that sale may be deemed to be either the end of the partnership’s tax year, generally December 31, or the year-end partnership tax filing due date, which is March 15.
4
The wash sale rule states, in essence, that a loss will be disallowed if taxpayer sells a security at a loss and acquires the same or a substantially identical security (or an option on such security) within 30 days of either side of the date the loss was realized. The disallowed loss is added to the cost basis of the substantially identical acquired security and generally recognized when the position is later sold.Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Think twice about how much you want to hold in cash and cash equivalents this year.In 2022, cash was tough to beat. A bear market in stocks, a historic sell-off in bonds and uncertainty over the war in Ukraine seemed to justify a flight to the safety of cash. So too did one of the fastest rate hiking cycles in Federal Reserve (Fed) history. While every hike caused stocks and longer-term bonds to lose value, they also increased the appeal of cash and short-term Treasuries.
By the end of last year, Treasury bills (T-bills) sported a yield of over 4.5%, money market fund assets reached an all-time high of almost USD 5 trillion, and American households held over USD 1 trillion in excess savings.Cash and T-bills do offer an attractive yield, and they certainly play an important role in a financial plan. But we caution against holding too much cash in 2023. We’d point to three key reasons:
Inflation—
Whatever the prevailing market yields, over the long term, inflation tends to erode the purchasing power of cash. Any capital that isn’t necessary for liquidity needs should probably find a home in an investment strategy.
Falling rates—
We expect short-term and long-term rates to fall over the near term. This means that most investors are probably better off locking in today’s yields rather than rolling over T-bills year after year. Yes, a cash yield of over 4.5% seems tempting today. But look ahead. Those yields are unlikely to last, in our view.
Stock and bond return potential—
We see better return opportunities in assets other than cash and T-bills. We expect both core bonds and equities to outperform cash this year, whether or not the economy goes into recession.
Purchasing power and the pain of inflation
While cash is a critical part of any investor’s plan, there’s obviously a cost to holding too much of it. To help our clients identify the appropriate amount for their needs, we suggest they think through its
four uses
. Decide how much you need:
To provide operating cash
To serve as a psychological safety net
To earmark for upcoming big-ticket purchases
To make an opportunistic investment
It’s a personal choice, and the “right” amount of cash will differ for everyone.
Of course, it’s important to keep in mind how much purchasing power your cash will lose over time. Over the long term, we think cash will yield about 2.4%, while inflation will run a little higher, at ~2.6%.
1
In other words, even before taxes, cash is unlikely to keep up with higher prices. We expect other asset classes—all 57 that we track—will outpace inflation over the next 10–15 years.Locking in today’s yields to prepare for lower rates
A yield above 4.5% for cash and cash-like instruments may look good now, but we don’t think those yields will last. The Fed seems to agree: The central bank’s most recent projections imply the Fed expects that sometime in 2024 it will start lowering rates gradually back to 2.5%.
If the Fed were to follow that playbook, investors over the next five years would be better off locking in the yield on a municipal bond rather than rolling over T-bills on an after-tax basis.What’s more, we think the Fed will likely start lowering rates even sooner and will move more aggressively than its projections signal. If we’re correct, investors may want to move quickly to lock in yields before they fall.
Recession or no recession: Better return prospects in stocks or bonds
We see a relatively high probability of a U.S. recession later this year. In that case, core investment grade fixed income would most likely outperform cash or T-bills. Even during the Global Financial Crisis, core fixed income returned 7%, while T-bills only returned 2%.
Let’s say the U.S. economy manages a “soft landing” this year and avoids recession. Risk assets such as equities, preferred stocks and high yield bonds could probably outperform. So far this year, we’ve seen a preview of what a soft landing could mean for markets. Global equities have gained 8%.
2
Core and high yield bonds have returned around 2.5% and 4%, respectively.

All are on track to outpace cash and T-bills.
There is one scenario in which T-bills could outperform: inflation proves to be sticky and the Fed keeps hiking. This seems unlikely, especially given recent economic data, which show cooling inflation and slowing growth.
But if this scenario does come to pass, we think higher rates would prove temporary, and the eventual downturn would deepen. It would still probably make sense to build a position in core fixed income even if we did see sticky inflation this year.
So step back. Think again about how much liquidity you really need. If you have excess capital in cash and cash equivalents, we see a range of options across the risk spectrum that could potentially give you higher returns over the long run.

From there, the softish landing projects it to reach 5.2% by March and fall to 2.5% by September 2026. On the other hand, the mild recession sees the fed funds rate falling immediately to 1.9% by September 2024 before rising back to 2.5% in September 2026.  On the right side is projected returns of Treasury bills for both the softish landing and recession case. The 5-year projected annualized return in a softish landing is 3.8%, and for recession 3.0%. The 10-year projected annualized return is 3.1% for the softish landing and 2.7% for the recession. This compares to the 5- and 10-year Treasury yields current at 3.5%, and the 5- and 10-year Muni tax-equivalent yield near 4.3%.Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.

Equity markets continued rallying this week as U.S. economic data held steady, while bond yields remained high. The U.S. CPI report for January came in largely in line with expectations – headline prices grew at a +0.5% m/m pace (+6.4% y/y) and core inflation (excluding food and energy) grew +0.4% m/m (+5.6% y/y). Details of the report told us that the trends we’ve observed in the past months still hold. Goods inflation continued to slow. Shelter inflation remained elevated and contributed to about half of the price increase. Services ex-shelter remained strong given its ties to the tight labor market. This report sent the U.S. Treasury yield curve into a deeper
inversion, while equities were largely flat.
On Wednesday equities found support from exceptionally strong U.S. retail sales data. While seasonality factors played a role, most acknowledge that the economy remained more resilient than expected. In our view, this week’s data releases increase the odds that the Fed continues hiking at a 25bp pace until we see clear signs of an economic slowdown. February data – which is usually cleaner than January from a seasonal adjustment perspective – will be key to watch in order to understand if upside risks to inflation and the labor market persist.
In light of the strong performance in U.S. equities since the start of the year, many investors are wondering if the rally is worth chasing. This week’s Strategy Question takes a closer look at the latest earnings results and discusses our favored ways to position.
Strategy Question: Following the weakest earnings season since Q4 2020, how do we position U.S. equities?
With over 70% of S&P 500 companies (by market cap) having reported their 4Q22 earnings, there are a number of interesting observations that can be drawn upon. Heading into the earnings season, market consensus was expecting earnings for the index to be down ~6%, the worst quarter of earnings since 3Q20. Actual earnings are tracking -5.0% in the quarter, or 1% above estimates. This is well below the 1-year (+4.5%), 5-year (+8.6%) and 10-year (+6.4%) averages in terms of U.S. earnings beats and highlights that this has been a relatively underwhelming earnings season. Interestingly, the median company has seen their earnings rise by 2.4% in the quarter, highlighting that earnings weakness is skewed towards the mega caps in the S&P 500. By sector, only four sectors saw positive growth in earnings – namely Energy, Industrials, Real Estate, and Utilities.However, the price reaction during the earnings season has actually been relatively positive, with the average company that has missed or beat earnings seeing their shares rise. This is not normal, as highlighted in the chart below. We believe that the reason for this is that institutional investors entered 2023 relatively cautious, with light positioning in anticipation of a difficult earnings season, and cautious forward guidance. While earnings were underwhelming, they were not dreadful. This was enough for the more positive share price performance during this earnings season. It is also very interesting that the distribution of these positive share price moves have centered on companies that meaningfully beat expectations (normal), and those missed earnings by the most. The latter group’s positive share price reaction on a poor earnings print likely reflects the view from investors that earnings have been reset enough, and factor in enough risk of a U.S. recession.There has also been growing consensus that margins need to further normalize back to longer-term levels, which we continued to see in the 4Q22 earnings results. In fact, S&P 500 net margins are now largely back to pre COVID-19 levels and have somewhat reset. In our 2023 earnings estimates, we expect margins to further decline, albeit more modestly from current levels. Our base case continues to call for a normal U.S. recession during 2H, but companies have advanced warning given the consensual nature of the upcoming economic slowdown and are preparing for this by shedding excess labor and expenses. In particular, the mega cap tech names that dominate S&P 500 earnings have started to unwind some of the over-hiring and spending of the last two years in order to protect margins. We expect this focus on efficiency and a lowering of expenses to be a focus of management teams and investors as we progress through 2023. Companies which are able to credibly defend margins and sustain earnings will likely be favored by investors this year.Overall, the market has made some progress towards resetting earnings estimates for 2023, but there is likely more coming that could extend through to the 2Q23 earnings season.
We favor segments of the market where earnings have already been reset enough and are close to trough levels, and/or where valuations remain reasonable.
These opportunities can be found in the U.S. semiconductor sector, and U.S. Midcaps (median S&P 500 earnings were up 2.4% in the quarter), which are some of our most favored segments of the U.S. equity market as we start 2023. On the other hand, with the S&P 500 approaching our 2023 year-end outlook of 4,200-4,300, it is worthwhile considering hedging broader U.S. large cap exposure via derivative structures such as put spreads. In addition, investors could consider switching significant single stock positions into equity structures to obtain some downside protection. Risk management is the key as we expect the broad U.S. equity market to stay volatile.All market and economic data as of February 16, 2023 and sourced from Bloomberg Finance L.P. and FactSet unless otherwise stated.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.A prenuptial agreement is a planning tool—and both parties can benefit.Erika Shaw, Matrimonial Specialist, Family Advisory
Emily Brunner, Wealth Advisor
Prenups tend to be a loaded topic, in large part because a marriage can only end in one of two ways: divorce or death. Prenuptial agreements are meant to define and protect non-marital property in either event. And since all marriages must come to an end, every engaged couple should consider whether a prenup is  appropriate for them.
Understandably, many couples and their families are uncomfortable with the thought of planning for the end of a marriage, especially one they have yet to celebrate. For example, some fear that asking for a prenup will offend a loved one or have a chilling effect on family relations. Others find the financial disclosure requirement is too much to ask.
Notwithstanding the discomfort, it’s always wise to make important decisions when things are good, as opposed to in times of crisis. Here are some points to consider:
State law matters
Absent a prenuptial agreement, the laws of the state where the parties are domiciled
at the time of divorce (or death)
will dictate what happens to their incomes, assets and liabilities. Laws vary from state to state with respect to:
The definition of marital versus non-marital property
How and when to value and distribute marital property
The treatment of income derived from and appreciation in value of non-marital property
A surviving spouse’s rights to the decedent’s estate at death.
Even if the laws of the state where a couple is domiciled
at the time of marriage
are favorable to one or both spouses, life moves on and ZIP Codes change. The laws of another state may be less favorable.
A prenuptial agreement allows two people to contract around state law to better control the outcome in the event of divorce (or death while happily married), regardless of where they land on the map.
Yes, the big reveal can be scary
Some parents are not ready to share inheritance details with their children, engaged or not. Other people may worry that disclosing their balance sheets to their fiancés will somehow change the nature of the relationship.
It’s helpful to expect some discomfort. Then again, transparency builds trust, and promotes open and honest communication. Perhaps the response will be better than expected!
It’s best to introduce the topic long before the wedding takes place, and to proceed slowly. Be clear on your own reasons for wanting the prenup; be open to hearing concerns you may not have anticipated; and work toward a result that both parties, with full knowledge, agree is reasonable.
Each party to a prenuptial agreement must disclose their income, assets and liabilities, valued as of the date of execution of the agreement (or as close in time to the date of signing as possible). Beneficial interests in trusts must also be disclosed, whether revocable or irrevocable, funded or not. While not every state requires full and frank written financial disclosures, it is best practice no matter where one resides.
A prenuptial agreement supplements an estate plan
Careful review of a family’s estate plan is crucial to determine what rights, if any, a spouse may have with respect to existing trusts. This will inform the couple’s decisions around how their respective property will pass upon death.
For example, if a wife passes away having been married for 20 years, does she want her separate property to pass to her husband for his benefit during his lifetime? What if she has three children from a prior marriage? What other family funds will the surviving spouse have access to?
The prenup is a floor, not a ceiling, when it comes to gifting
A spouse must ensure the terms of any prenuptial agreement are incorporated into their will. However, one may always give more to a spouse than what is called for under the prenuptial agreement, either during lifetime or upon death.
Information is power
It is important to know what a prenuptial agreement can and cannot do. For example, a couple
cannot
contract for custody and child support in a prenuptial agreement, regardless of jurisdiction.
To complicate matters, every state has its own public policies, so what may fly in one state may not in another. For example, only some states allow for the waiver of temporary alimony in a prenup. Thus, such a provision may be valid in one state, but invalid in another for reasons related to public policy.
Timing is everything
When deciding whether to proceed with a prenup, each party should consult with independent, local legal counsel. Seek guidance from both trusts and estates and matrimonial lawyers well in advance of the wedding date to allow for plenty of time to draft, negotiate, review and sign.
A conversation with benefits to last a lifetime
Most importantly, consider the timing, tone and substance of premarital planning conversations between both family members and future spouses. While the terms of a prenup may ultimately favor one spouse over the other, the terms should benefit both parties. (Terms that are entirely one-sided in a prenup could be said to ‘shock the conscience’ and result in the prenup being set aside).
A truly collaborative process allows for all parties to feel heard. Open communication and solution-focused discussions are touchstones of any healthy relationship, regardless of whether a prenup is signed. Clarity around how each party sees the future can only help smooth the road ahead.

Yet misconceptions persist…Sustainable investing has grown at the breathtaking rate of more than 50% year-over-year since 2019.
1
Still, misconceptions about this investment strategy abound. These myth-busting facts will help you see why the Sustainable Investing market is expanding rapidly.
Myth 1: You can’t drive real change through sustainable investing.
Fact: You can have an effect — particularly through active managers with corporate engagement strategies.
Every company affects the world around it – sometimes for the better (e.g., by being a good employer) and sometimes for the worse (e.g., by polluting a local ecosystem).
As an investor, you can intentionally sponsor specific kinds of outcomes through your investments.
For example, you can invest in equity funds that actively partner with companies to change their practices from within. All shareholders have the right to vote for company policies, as well as engage with managers and board members on material issues. If you invest in actively managed funds, they can use your shares to advocate for more sustainable practices. Common themes that sustainable funds advocate for include better climate governance, increased workforce diversity, reduced plastic packaging, improved animal welfare, and stronger data privacy.
In some cases, sustainable funds even push to take board seats so they have a larger voice in governing companies on an ongoing basis.
By investing in actively managed funds that engage directly with companies, you can drive real change through sustainable investing.
Myth 2: You can’t make money from sustainable investing.
Fact: We have seen sustainable investing strategies outperform the market.Past performance is no guarantee of future returns.
It is not possible to invest directly in an index
It’s possible to make money from sustainable investing in good times and in bad. Since January 2012 until June 2022, the MSCI ESG Equity Leaders (which focuses on companies with strong ESG scores) have outperformed the broader MSCI World index by 20 basis points (and experienced less volatility during that period as well).
1
There are two ways in which Sustainable Investing can help drive financial returns:
Focusing on material environmental, social, and governance-related (ESG) risk
—We live in a new investing reality where more extensive data, corporate disclosure and regulatory reporting on ESG issues give investors new insights into how well companies are managing these components. Done right, a focus on key ESG issues can potentially lower investment risk. Financially material ESG factors (like
human capital management
) are factors that could have a significant impact -- both positive and negative -- on a company’s business model and value drivers.
Identifying growth-oriented megatrends
—Megatrends are powerful and transformative influences that have an impact on the economy and society. Some examples today include renewable energy like wind and solar, smart grids, and energy storage. Identifying and investing in these megatrends may provide long-term growth as these trends aim to reshape the market.
Myth 3: Sustainable investing is just for activists and environmentalists.
Fact: Sustainable Investing is a broad approach, encompassing diverse motivations and values systems.
Among those who do not invest in sustainable funds today, 31% believe that sustainable investing is strictly for environmentalists and activists
2
, and they cite that as the key reason they themselves don’t pursue the tactic.
Yet, a far broader swath of the investing public favors SI—and for a variety of reasons
2
:
38% believe it makes good commercial business sense
37% believe it represents the future of investing
32% believe sustainable investing is likely to improve [their personal] investment performance.
Moreover, as Sustainable Investing continues to deliver strong and resilient financial returns, a broader range of clients has begun adopting this approach. For example, 39% of endowments with more than $1 billion in assets attributes sustainable investing as a source of alpha.
3
Indeed, many sustainable investors are driven purely by financial returns. Other proponents are driven by more socially oriented motivations, including a desire to invest in education, healthcare, military veterans, and diversity along with other socially responsible endeavors.
Regardless of your motivations—environmental, financial, and/or social—sustainable investing might be able to help you achieve your objectives.
Myth 4: You need to have a lot of money to sustainably invest.
Fact: Investment minimums for sustainable investing are low and dropping lower.
Historically, sustainable investing was exclusively for the ultra-wealthy (i.e., for investors who could dedicate large allocations and significant staff time to the work required).
That’s changed. Today, minimums to participate in sustainable investing are low and dropping even lower.
This makes the strategy more accessible to a wider audience , including younger investors who want to get started in sustainable investing with  small, incremental allocations.
Myth 5: Sustainable investing is all about start-ups.
Fact: Sustainable investing is an approach that you can use to invest in start-ups, mature companies and even government agencies.
Many people hear “sustainable investing” and immediately think of early-stage businesses. Or, they visualize a social enterprise designed to help a particular community or emerging economy.
But that view is too limited.
In reality, Sustainable Investing is a lens that you can apply to a wide range of businesses across sectors and sizes, representing a vast array of investment opportunities. For example:
Companies of all sizes are working toward a more sustainable future by pursuing opportunities like electric vehicles, regenerative agriculture, and sustainable aviation fuels
Municipalities are issuing bonds to help fund infrastructure projects to help communities adapt to climate change
Nonprofits are issuing market-rate bonds to help teachers, firefighters, and veterans finance affordable housing.
Sustainable Investing is a lens that can apply to any investment type.

Sustainable investing (“SI”) and investment approaches that incorporate environmental social and governance (“ESG”) objectives may include additional risks. Sustainable Investing strategies, including ESG SMAs, mutual funds and ETFs, may limit the types and number of investment opportunities and, as a result, could underperform other strategies that do not have an ESG or sustainable focus. Certain strategies focused on particular sectors may be more concentrated in particular industries that share common factors and can be subject to similar business risks and regulatory burdens. Investing on the basis of sustainability/ESG criteria can involve qualitative and subjective analysis and there can be no assurance that the methodology utilized, or determinations made, by the investment manager will align with the beliefs or values of the investor. Investment managers can have different approaches to ESG or sustainable investing and can offer strategies that differ from the strategies offered by other investment managers with respect to the same theme or topic. ESG or sustainable investing is not a uniformly defined concept and scores or ratings may vary across data providers that use similar or different screens based on their process for evaluating ESG characteristics. Additionally, when evaluating investments, an investment manager is dependent upon information and data that may be incomplete, inaccurate or unavailable, which could cause the manager to incorrectly assess an investment’s ESG/ Sustainable Investing performance.
J.P. Morgan takes a global approach to sustainable investing and the solutions offered through our sustainable investing platform meet our internally defined criteria for a sustainable investment. The evolving nature of sustainable finance regulations and the development of jurisdiction-specific legislation setting out the regulatory criteria for a “sustainable investment” or “ESG” investment mean that there is likely to be a degree of divergence as to the regulatory meaning of such terms. This is already the case in the European Union where, for example, under the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (EU) (2019/2088) certain criteria must be satisfied in order for a product to be classified as a “sustainable investment”. Any references to “sustainable investing”, “SI” or “ESG” in this material are intended as references to our internally defined criteria only and not to any jurisdiction-specific regulatory definition.
Investors should understand the potential tax liabilities surrounding a municipal bond purchase. Certain municipal bonds are federally taxed if the holder is subject to alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, are federally taxable. The investor should note that the income from tax-free municipal bond funds may be subject to state and local taxation and the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT).​Since January 2012 until June 2022, the MSCI ESG Equity Leaders (which focuses on companies with strong ESG scores) have outperformed the broader MSCI World index by 20 basis points (and experienced less volatility during that period as well)..Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.

Morgan.Overview
Latin America has historically been regarded a natural sphere of influence for the United States and a key trading partner given its geographical proximity. Yet relations between the two regions are not as closely intertwined as they once were. Recent US administrations have focused on other regions, including the Middle East and Asia, and US engagement with Latin America has waned. Meanwhile, over the past ten years, China has significantly expanded its influence in the region through growing trade, investment and credit. As tensions between US and China continue to escalate, Latin America’s close ties to China raise important policy dilemmas for the Biden administration. This article explores the extent to which China has gained power in the region and whether Latin America remains firmly within the sphere of US influence. Looking ahead, is the US willing (and able) to regain influence in Latin America under the Biden administration?
The growing influence of China in Latin America
A November 2020 headline from Foreign Affairs magazine states that Donald Trump drove Latin America into China's arms; in reality, relations between Latin America and China had been developing long before Trump took office, but trade and investment ties have grown substantially in recent years. In total, the US remains Latin America's main export market, accounting for US$467bn (45%) of total export sales, but Mexico accounts for about 80% of these flows. For many other countries, China has become a key trading partner, with total exports from Latin America reaching US$126bn in 2019 (and rising further in year-on-year terms in the first three quarters of 2020, bucking global trends).
It is trickier to quantify the growing importance of China on total investment flows into the region, as some funds enter countries through third countries (a Brazilian central bank study in 2016 estimated that 80% of Chinese FDI entered the country this way). Of the direct investment from China to Latin America, most is registered as inflows in the British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands, but this is not the final destination for this investment, which is channelled via firms registered in these countries to elsewhere in the region.Other data are easier to quantify and point to growing Chinese involvement in Latin America. In 2020, Chinese M&A in Latin America reached US$7.7bn – more than Europe’s and North America’s M&A in Latin America combined. Investment in infrastructure is also easier to track as much occurs via China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI – its flagship foreign investment programme). Since 2017, 19 countries in Latin America have joined the Initiative and although the four largest economies in the region (Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Colombia) have not done so, they all have bilateral co-operation agreements in place to facilitate Chinese investment in domestic infrastructure development.
A crucial source of bank credit
China has also expanded its influence in Latin America through extending credit lines to the region. State-owned Export-Import Bank (EXIM) and the China Development Bank (CDB) are the main sources of finance and have generally lent bilaterally to governments in Latin America, as well as directly to state-owned companies. Some of this is tied to specific infrastructure projects or to energy projects. Private-sector estimates suggest that between 2005 and 2019, the CDB and EXIM have provided more than US$137bn in loan commitments to Latin American governments and state-owned firms. For many countries, Chinese lending has been more significant than credit from institutions such as the IMF, World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank (IDB).The US attempt to regain influence in the region
The Biden administration is likely to engage more with Latin America than its predecessor. Initial signs suggest that Mr. Biden regards the region as strategically important, even if there are priorities elsewhere. The long-standing policy areas of immigration and security will continue to be important, but a new focus area will emerge, with the Biden administration likely to explore possibilities to re-shore supply chains closer to home.
In theory, some countries in Latin America are well-placed to benefit from these trends, particularly Mexico, which already exports significant amounts of mainly manufactured goods to the US. These accounted for US$371bn in 2019 and after falling in mid-2020 have been growing again firmly on an annual basis since last September. There is some evidence that the US-China trade war has boosted Mexican exports to the US, with some Chinese firms moving operations from China to Mexico in order to avoid tariffs placed on Chinese exports to the US, particularly in the food manufacturing and transport equipment sub-sectors. Preferential tariff treatment under the USMCA will also help with this, as will some of the high regional-value content thresholds under the USMCA treaty (including the requirement that 75% of auto parts must be made within North America, which will incentivise domestic manufacturing).
Aside from Mexico, Colombia and parts of Central America are better placed to take advantage of potential nearshoring. These countries already have free-trade agreements in place with the US and their supply chains are, to varying degrees, already integrated with the US. Efforts to lure firms away from China are already evident. Colombia's investment promotion agency, ProColombia, launched a campaign in September 2020 to persuade firms to relocate to Colombia, targeting its efforts at 536 firms currently operating in China. The investment promotion agency in Costa Rica, CINDE, has been pursuing similar goals, focusing its efforts on high-end manufacturing and IT services. CINDE has spoken specifically of a “China-plus-one” strategy, which seeks to appeal to firms who do not necessarily want to abandon China-based operations, but who want to diversify their operational base, opening facilities that are closer to the US market.
China’s continued growth prospects in the region
Despite US intentions to regain influence in the region, Latin American governments are unlikely to abandon efforts to court China. China's economic prospects in 2021 are significantly firmer than other major economies (including the US) and Latin American governments will hope that a rapid recovery will stimulate Chinese demand for its own exports. Around three-quarters of China's imports from Latin America are raw materials, mainly hard commodities and food from Brazil, Chile and Peru. The Chinese market is the most important export destination for all of these countries, accounting for about 30% of total export revenue. Chinese demand for all of these goods is set to strengthen, as the government in that country seeks to engineer a private consumption-led recovery. However, exports to China are also important to Argentina, Colombia, Venezuela and Ecuador, accounting for 10-20% of exports. Aside from Venezuela, whose oil exports to China have collapsed in 2020 on the back of a domestic economic collapse, recovering Chinese demand should also provide some support to these countries' exports. Trade diversification is on China's trade policy agenda, which could also work to the benefit of Latin America in the longer term.
The extent to which US efforts will be successful will depend, in part, on the attractiveness of countries’ underlying business environments. It is broadly accepted that supply-chain diversification away from China had already begun prior to the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, and that it will continue as tensions between the US and China persist. However, what is much more uncertain is who will benefit. So far, firms have diversified manufacturing bases away from China but other Asian countries (including Vietnam and Taiwan) have benefitted more extensively than Latin America.Export destinations

Instead of attempting to influence all areas of Latin America’s relation with China, the Biden administration will likely focus on areas of critical importance. The question of 5G development for example will be a particularly thorny issue, as Latin American governments continue to partner with China's telecommunications giant, Huawei, to develop the technology. The US has expressed clear concern that such a development represents a security threat and would compromise the future of US-Latin American relations, but many countries in the region have looked to Huawei to provide low-cost solutions and have partnered with the company on rolling out fourth-generation (4G) networks. The dilemma will be particularly acute as telecoms infrastructure is a weak area of the operating environment in many countries and governments are keen to secure investment in this area in order to improve provision. We do not expect Huawei to be frozen out of 5G development in the region, but the debate could open the door for other global players to participate more than would otherwise be the case.
The US is also likely to continue paying close attention to Chinese lending and investment practices. There has traditionally been much more conditionality attached to US loans (either bilaterally, or via pressure exerted through multilateral institutions such as the IMF) than Chinese lending to Latin America. Meanwhile, US investment in the region requires certain disclosures and quality standards that are less evident in Chinese investment projects. While President Biden looks set to adopt less aggressive rhetoric towards China, there is little indication that his government will be less concerned about China's trade and investment practices. Latin American governments are therefore likely to continue to come under pressure from the US on this front; we do not believe that pressure will be significant enough to interrupt trade or investment ties with the US, but it could be a factor that prohibits a deepening of relations between Latin America and the US.
A delicate balancing act
Many countries in Latin America have extensive trade and investment links with both China and the US, and will be seeking to cultivate ever-closer ties with both sides. To date, this balancing act has been possible, partly because relations between Latin America and China, on the one hand, and the US on the other, have focused on different areas. Latin America has tended to export raw materials to China, but mainly manufactured goods to the US, while investment from China has centered on infrastructure projects. There has been little overlap, avoiding direct competition between the US and Chinese markets.
Our baseline forecast is that most countries will be able to retain this balance, facilitating some growth in exports and inward investment for Latin America. However, there are some signs that China and the US might increasingly exert leverage over their trade and investment partners, making it impossible for third-party countries to remain neutral. This would be less problematic for countries with much closer ties with either China or the US (Mexico, for example, would not be hit significantly if it had to realign more demonstrably with the US). However, countries with a more equal reliance on both China and the US, such as Peru, Argentina, Colombia and Ecuador, would be affected more noticeably if they were pulled into the trade war and forced to side with either China or the US.Conclusion
China has expanded its influence in Latin America in recent years by virtue of closer trade, investment and finance ties. However, for many economies – particularly Mexico and Central America – the US remains a crucial trade partner, while corporate ties between the US and Latin America also remain close. In the coming years, Latin America will remain caught between two powers as US-Chinese relations remain fraught. Governments in the region will do their best to maximise any potential opportunities that arise, mainly in terms of diversification of supply chains as firms reduce their reliance on China. Some countries in the region may benefit, but these will mainly be countries that are close to the US and with an established track record of manufacturing for export (mainly Mexico). However, low-cost Asian economies such as Vietnam will represent fierce competition and will limit the extent to which Latin America can substantially gain market share. Still, already-established trade relationships with China will help the region recover from a particularly sharp coronavirus-induced recession and the prospect of renewed Chinese investment in Latin American infrastructure projects bodes well for medium-term prospects. There are difficult waters to navigate, with issues such as 5G development posing particular difficulties to policy-makers in Latin America, but our baseline forecast is that while the United States might attempt to increase its influence in the region, China will continue to be a close trading and investment partner for most countries in the region.Download the full reportA line graph showing Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI) in Latin America as of 2018.A graphic illustrating state-to-state financing from China to Latin American countries from 2005 to 2020.

TITLE CARD:
The role of Latin America in the U.S.-China conflict
A conversation between J.P. Morgan and The Economist Intelligence Unit
Christophe Aba
Head of Investments, J.P. Morgan Private Bank, Latin America
Chris Aba: The rise of China is arguably one of the most important geopolitical events of the 21st century. There are a few regions in the world as susceptible or impacted by the U.S.-China conflict than Latin America. To help us unpack the risks and opportunities presented to Latin America by U.S.-China conflict, I’m joined today by John Ferguson from The Economist Intelligence Unit.
A delicate balancing act:
The impact of US-China conflict in Latin America
Chris Aba: John, you recently authored a piece together with the J.P. Morgan Private Bank entitled “A delicate balancing act: The impact of U.S.-China conflict in Latin America.” Historically, relationships between Latin America and the rest of the world have been dominated by trade. John, how did the rise in U.S.-China tensions impact Latin America?
John Ferguson:
Thanks, Chris. I think the U.S.-China relations are impacting Latin American countries in a number of ways. We’ve got the U.S.-China trade war, which is still ongoing. And I think we should all recognize that even though we have a new administration in the U.S., that will still keep going and evolve in certain ways. So for investors and policymakers, there’s a number of areas that they need to keep an eye on in terms of the superpower rivalry there in Latin America.
Chris Aba:
So the prior U.S. administration definitely had a more domestic agenda, and one can say was relatively disengaged at best with the region of Latin America. We have the new president who’s recently come into office, they’re putting in place their policies. Do you think they see the rise of China and its role in Latin America as its threat?
John Ferguson:
I do. At least a key challenge and probably their main foreign policy challenge. So unlike Mr. Trump, who had a very much American-first approach, Mr. Biden, his administration, will take a much more multilateral approach to the world. And that means finding like-minded allies around the world and pushing back on China in areas like the belt and road initiative, for example.  Like in areas such as 5G and the telecoms and the infrastructure roll out there. And that’s definitely playing out in Latin America. So that’s a key area for people to watch because countries have to really walk that fine line between trying not to annoy the U.S., but keeping those good trading relationships and investment relationships with China as well.
Chris Aba: So I want to talk about one of the opportunities now. Near shoring is something that’s been discussed a lot. How realistic is it for companies to move their supply chains closer to Latin America? And how realistic is it for Latin America to compete with the economies of Asia?
John Ferguson:
It’s much deeper and wider. So you’ve mentioned commodities. The trade story is really important. Commodity exports have grown tremendously from Latin America to China in recent years. To the point where China is the major trading partner for many Latin American countries.  Mexico is an outlier there, but for many Latin American countries, China is the main source of exports. But it’s deeper than that. And wider than that. Lending. Investment from China. I’ve mentioned the belt and road. They also, over the last 10 years, I’ve seen a lot of investment and lending from so-called policy banks that are in China. Export import bank. China development bank. Now that peaked around 2010, has been slowly declining, but we’re also seeing that relationship evolve. And we’re now seeing more private sector lending and private sector financial activity. So we’re seeing, for example, a lot more M&A. And then you’ve got the vaccine diplomacy and vaccine rollout. So the influence and role of China goes beyond trade, beyond investment, and now it gets into a vaccine and vaccine diplomacy as well.
Chris Aba: So China recently published their new five-year plan. Sustainability is front and center in that plan. China plans to cap carbon emissions by 2030 to become net neutral by 2060. And obviously that potentially has a big impact on Latin America. How do you see China’s renewed focus on sustainability impacting Latin American supply chain?
John Ferguson:
Yeah, it’s quite a significant impact. And I particularly think about energy exporters: Brazil, Venezuela, Colombia, for example. So China will be pushing hard down this road. Sustainability is a key theme, but also energy security is a key theme for the Chinese economy and Chinese policymakers. So right now they take most of their oil from Russia and Saudi Arabia, and their gas from Turkmenistan. So over the long term, it might raise questions about relationships with Latin American exporters, but I think bigger and more broadly than that—China will really push hard on renewable energies, and they have a lot of capability and capacity and opportunity to develop their own renewable energy market. So for me, there’s just a lot of questions, really, a lot of challenges for Latin American energy exporters to the Chinese economy over the medium term.
Chris Aba: John, thank you very much. The conflict between the U.S. and China isn’t going away. And so this is probably the first of many conversations that we’ll be having on this topic. I want to thank everybody for listening, and if you have any questions at all about what we discussed today, please reach out to your J.P. Morgan representative.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR INVESTMENTS AND POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
Conflicts of interest will arise whenever JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or any of its affiliates (together, “J.P. Morgan”) have an actual or perceived economic or other incentive in its management of our clients’ portfolios to act in a way that benefits J.P. Morgan. Conflicts will result, for example (to the extent the following activities are permitted in your account): (1) when J.P. Morgan invests in an investment product, such as a mutual fund, structured product, separately managed account or hedge fund issued or managed by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or an affiliate, such as J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc.; (2) when a J.P. Morgan entity obtains services, including trade execution and trade clearing, from an affiliate; (3) when J.P. Morgan receives payment as a result of purchasing an investment product for a client’s account; or (4) when J.P. Morgan receives payment for providing services (including shareholder servicing, recordkeeping or custody) with respect to investment products purchased for a client’s portfolio. Other conflicts will result because of relationships that J.P. Morgan has with other clients or when J.P. Morgan acts for its own account.
Investment strategies are selected from both J.P. Morgan and third-party asset managers and are subject to a review process by our manager research teams. From this pool of strategies, our portfolio construction teams select those strategies we believe fit our asset allocation goals and forward-looking views in order to meet the portfolio’s investment objective.
As a general matter, we prefer J.P. Morgan managed strategies. We expect the proportion of J.P. Morgan managed strategies will be high (in fact, up to 100 percent) in strategies such as cash and high-quality fixed income, subject to applicable law and any account-specific considerations.
While our internally managed strategies generally align well with our forward-looking views, and we are familiar with the investment processes as well as the risk and compliance philosophy of the firm, it is important to note that J.P. Morgan receives more overall fees when internally managed strategies are included. We offer the option of choosing to exclude J.P.

Then you might want to take some steps to help ensure that the non-grantor trusts you create pay as little as possible in state income taxes.
One such step could be to reduce, if not eliminate, the trusts’ duty to pay any state income taxes. This feat might be arranged simply by making sure the trustees of your (new and/or already established) non-grantor trusts reside in the “right” state or that the trust owns only the right kind of assets.

,retains sufficient powers over the trust that he or she is deemed to own the assets and therefore must pay any taxes on any income the trust earns and any gains it recognizes. This is the case even if the creator (or grantor) of the trust has forever and irrevocably relinquished the right to benefit from the trust’s assets.
2
“Non-grantor trusts”—The trust itself is considered the owner of the assets in the trust. Consequently, the trust itself must pay taxes on the income it accumulates and the gains it recognizes. (This type of trust is often created upon the grantor’s death.)
Meanwhile, state tax law governs how much—and even whether—a specific non-grantor trust must pay in taxes to that state.
Yes, it can get complicated
We’re talking about taxes, so of course there are complications:
Management matters
How a trust is managed can make a difference. Non-grantor trusts don’t always owe taxes even when they “live” in a state that generally taxes “resident” non-grantor trusts.
For example, if a trust pays all of its income annually to a beneficiary, its net income could be close to zero. As a result, its state income tax burden could be relatively small. (In that case, the beneficiary would owe tax on the income the trust had earned, based on the beneficiary’s state of residence.)
What’s in the trust matters
Even if a trust “lives” in a state that does not tax income at all, the trust might still owe taxes to another state, one that does tax income.
For instance, if a trust owns real property, or an interest in a “pass-through” entity (such as a partnership) that does business in a state with income taxes, the trust may owe taxes to that state on the income the property or business earns.
Where the beneficiaries live can matter
Some states, such as California, look at the beneficiaries’ residence when determining whether, and to what extent, to tax trust income.
Meanwhile, New York has a “throwback” tax that, in certain circumstances, can subject New York resident beneficiaries to tax on income earned by some non-grantor trusts in earlier years.
You might be able to do something about that tax bill
Sometimes (though certainly not always), all you need to do to reduce or eliminate state-level taxes on non-grantor trust assets is to simply replace all trustee(s) residing in states that have an income tax with trustees (plus any other fiduciaries) with trustees and other fiduciaries who are residents of another state.
Of course, it is not easy to find capable and trustworthy trustees in any state. That is why many corporate fiduciaries such as J.P. Morgan who can serve as trustees have trust companies in tax-friendly jurisdictions.
For example: Let’s assume Grace,
3
a New Jersey resident, at her death funds a $5 million trust for the benefit of her only son, Frank. Grace’s sister, Lily, also a New Jersey resident, is the sole trustee. This trust allows the trustee (Lily) to accumulate or distribute income and principal to the beneficiary (Frank). But Frank is well off and does not need any income from the trust.
Option 1
—
Pay a lot in state taxes
Let’s say the trust invests exclusively in a portfolio of publicly traded stocks and bonds and earns $300,000 in taxable income. Lily distributes none of the income to Frank. Result: The trust would owe around $19,000 to New Jersey in income taxes.
Option 2
—
Pay no state taxes
Let’s take the same scenario but make someone other than Lily trustee. Let the trustee be someone who lives in New York, or J.P. Morgan, which has a trust company in Delaware. The result then would almost surely be that the trust owes no state income taxes—not to New Jersey, and probably not to the state of the trustee’s residence.
4
Not for taxes alone
Residence alone should not govern your decisions about who should be the trustee (and other fiduciaries) of the trusts you create.
Rather, when you pick a trustee, it should be because your answer to this question is “Yes”:
Does this person (or professional) have the time, willingness, capabilities and longevity to discharge a trustee’s many and complicated duties over the life of the trust?
If all else is close to equal, you may want to consider choosing a trustee whose mere residence would save the trust, and ultimately your beneficiaries, money.
And if you already have a trust in a high-tax state, that condition almost certainly can be changed. The trustee’s lawyers usually handle the process of changing trustees, which modern trust agreements generally streamline. Of course, the cooperation of the existing trustees in any transition helps. So too would be the cooperation of courts, which would almost always be involved in the succession process for trusts created under the terms of a decedent’s Will.
We can help
All decisions about trustees should be made in consultation with your tax advisors and estate planning lawyers.
Your J.P. Morgan team is available to work closely with them—and you—to help you ensure the choices you make today support the long-term goals you have for yourself and your family.
1
In some circumstances, a third party might be deemed the grantor of a grantor trust—for instance, in the case of a trust under which a beneficiary has power to distribute trust income and principal to himself or herself.
2
Irrevocable grantor trusts are generally seen as excellent tools for preserving family wealth. That’s because grantors, as owners of the assets, must pay any taxes due on trust income. These payments reduce the value of the grantors’ estates. That, in turn, eventually reduces the estate taxes due when the grantors die. Meanwhile, until then, the assets in trust grow undiminished by those tax payments.

In making decisions about whether, and in what amounts, distributions should be made to beneficiaries, trustees of non-grantor trusts should also consider the fact that a trust’s accumulated ordinary income in excess of, in 2023, $14,650 would be subject to U.S. income tax at a rate of 37%, whereas the top marginal rate for beneficiaries, whether filing singly or as married filing jointly is well over $500,000. Distribution of some trust income might therefore be advisable to preserve overall family wealth, even if the trust is not subject to state-level income tax and beneficiary is.Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.

For most investors, 2022 will not be missed. But a closer look suggests that against the backdrop of historic cross-asset drawdowns, a few Asian markets actually showed more resilient performance. Equity markets in India, Singapore, and Indonesia all gave investors positive returns in local currency terms. Asian currencies also held up better than developed market currencies, helped by strong exports, more benign inflation and stronger current accounts.
In 2023, we think three key themes will likely shape the region: the normalization of China’s economy, the slowdown in global trade as U.S. and European consumers cut back on spending, and the impact of geopolitics on capital flows and supply chains. We see investment opportunities in equity markets in China (onshore and offshore), Korea and Taiwan. In fixed income, we like Asia investment grade, and are now turning neutral on high yield after a cautious stance in 2022.
Global trade slowdown
The slowdown in global exports is a key factor shaping Asia’s outlook in 2023. After two years of booming exports driven by Western stimulus and pandemic shifts in consumption behavior, trade growth is already slowing sharply, with China, Korea and Taiwan exports all contracting in the last quarter of 2022. South Korea is often viewed as a bellwether for the region: not only is it one of the biggest trade-oriented economies, but it is also the first to publish detailed data every month. The recent trend is not encouraging, with exports excluding ships and petroleum falling 12.1% year-over-year in December. Little has changed from a 14.2% decline in November. December exports by product reveal continued rapid declines of 30 to 45% year-over-year, in semiconductors, household electronics and computer accessories.
In the U.S. and Europe, consumers are cutting back on purchases of work-at-home products after heavy spending during the pandemic, in favor of essentials like food and energy. This shift, both in terms of lower absolute spending by global consumers, but also the shifting composition from goods to services, is set to impact the region. This, even more so than the positive boost from China’s reopening, creates a challenging backdrop for the first half of the year. The major export downturn that is unfolding will most likely be associated with inventory destocking, cutbacks in production and delays in new business investment. Once the global dust settles, Asia could outperform, but it is likely to be more of a second-half story. In our view, the downturn in semiconductors will likely bottom first, creating some opportunities for investors.
Why is trade so important? Essentially it is the key swing factor for the region’s economy. Shifts in domestic demand and policy tend to happen more slowly and rarely see big swings from year to year, but global trade tends to exhibit large cyclical swings. In conjunction, corporate earnings and regional index performance tends to be closely related to these swings, making it a critical factor for investors considering exposure in these markets.China’s reopening is underway
As discussed in
an earlier note
, China’s ‘reopening’ has now well and truly commenced. After a series of rapid policy changes that removed most of the mobility restrictions, infections surged in December, and economic activity weakened significantly as a result. More recently there are signs that many cities are now past the peak in terms of infections. As a result, mobility indicators are beginning to climb higher. From an economic growth perspective, the Chinese economy may have reached an inflection point. We expect this winter to mark the trough in the current economic slowdown, followed by a reopening-driven recovery in 2023.
We have been communicating that Chinese domestic consumption and the housing downturn are the two main drags in the post-pandemic era. With reopening, consumption will likely see a clear boost. A recovery in the service sector will likely be a key driver; as mobility restrictions continue to be lifted, gatherings resume and business and leisure trips restart. Healthcare spending could also grow again after three years of exclusive focus on Covid. Goods spending will likely also ride on the trend, though the growth impact could be smaller given a narrower gap compared to the pre-pandemic trend, as well as continued drag from housing weakness.
The property sector – the other main challenge to China’s economy – could add a layer of complication to the recovery picture. Confidence in the property market remains weak and the unwinding of speculative price bubbles, excess supply, and insolvent developers will likely take time. We expect housing sales to bottom in 1H 2023, with the support of lower mortgage rates and increased economic stability from reopening. This will likely mean less drag from the housing sector in 2H 2023 as well as 2024, although the housing sector is unlikely to lead the recovery as it has typically done in past cycles.
Exports – the biggest bright spot in the economy over the past two years – will likely lose their shine amid the above-mentioned global trade downturn. We have penciled in a double digit contraction in exports, but there are upside and downside risks depending on the depth and length of the recession in the developed world.In terms of policy, we expect the PBOC to remain accommodative through 2023 to support the ongoing recovery, especially due to the fact that the macro environment is still fragile. We expect the fiscal deficit to be sizable in order to buy time for the growth recovery to be sustainable. That said, infrastructure investment growth will likely ease from the elevated levels seen in 2022.
Taking all these into account, we upgrade our outlook for China GDP to 4.0% for 2023 and maintain a 4.9% growth assumption for 2024.
1
This outlook is based on the confluence of base effects (a weaker than expected Q4 22), stronger consumption, less drag from the property sector, as well as reduced infrastructure spending and weaker exports.
China’s impact on the region could be varied
Partially offsetting the drag from weaker global demand, China’s economic re-opening will likely be a boost to the region. That said, we see a few reasons why the regional impact from China’s re-opening could be muted relative to expectations. The usual trend as countries have reopened is that household consumption rebounds the most. We expect this in China as pent up household demand drives an increase in consumption, especially in services, and to some extent in goods. This can be a boost to domestic travel, tourism, hotels, and restaurants, as well as consumer goods, but this will likely have less impact on the rest of the region. Why is that so? China produces, rather than imports, most of the goods consumed domestically. Therefore, Chinese consumption simply does not create the same growth impulse as U.S. consumer demand does. An example of this is the electronics cycle, where China’s domestic final consumption is smaller than re-exports.So in the case of semiconductors, China’s reopening is unlikely to independently move the needle for regional producers in South Korea or Taiwan. That said, we do expect the bulk of the semiconductor cycle downturn to be behind us – which can create opportunities for equity investors. For the type of goods more destined for domestic consumption, like skincare, premium food etc., we could see some improvement benefiting the likes of Japan and New Zealand.
Relative to goods spending, we think services spending could be more meaningful. This is particularly the case with international tourism, which will likely see a meaningful impact from China’s reopening. Countries like Thailand, Singapore, and Japan are expected to see a significant influx of travelers, which can help to boost tourism-dependent sectors. It also implies a boost to oil demand as air transportation, both domestically and internationally, continues to rebound as Chinese travelers depart. This contributes to our call for a conservative appreciation of oil prices in 2023. Net energy exporters such as Indonesia will likely benefit from this trend.
The other facet of China’s global impact is the continued correction of the property sector. As mentioned above, the sector could find a bottom in 2023, but is unlikely to see a sharp sustained rebound. This matters for the world because Chinese demand for commodities and raw materials is primarily driven by property investment and construction. Without a sharp rebound in this sector, Chinese imports of base metals and other raw materials are likely to remain subdued.
From an investment perspective, China’s reopening will likely provide a boost to companies that benefit from a recovery in domestic consumption and services. Luxury goods and regional travel will also likely see a boost. Together with more recent regulatory loosening towards the internet sector, we see improved market sentiment and liquidity inflows.
Post-reopening and re-evaluating the long-term investment case
Following the reopening surge, once fundamentals move back into the driver’s seat global investors will have to reckon with the fact that China has not provided returns that are commensurate with the risk – and they’ll be forced to question whether this will change in the near future. China stands out from global markets – not just developed markets (DM) but emerging markets (EM) as well – for the lack of a relationship between growth and earnings. In the charts below showing MSCI EM and MSCI World, GDP, earnings, and the equity indices generally move in line since there is a “normal” relationship between nominal GDP and earnings.In China it’s the opposite: the index has generally followed earnings as one would expect (except in bubble periods), but GDP growth has significantly outpaced earnings growth, especially for the offshore MSCI China Index.This (lack of a) relationship is even more glaring on a country-by-country basis below. While most EMs exhibit some relationship between equity returns and GDP, China stands out for having an annualized nominal GDP of nearly 14% over the 20 years leading up to the pandemic, with an equity return of slightly over 4%.It is not entirely clear why the GDP and earnings relationship is broken. Regardless of the reason, the burden of proof on a forward-looking basis is high. The key question is whether the situation could change and be better for shareholders going forward. This is particularly poignant given the fact that China’s growth is structurally slowing and the overall regulatory environment has become less shareholder-friendly, not more.
The impact of geopolitics and capital flows
Geopolitical risk appears to be easing following signals that the U.S. and China want to tone down tensions, at least in the near term. The recent audit deal on Chinese companies listed in the U.S. is a positive step towards building a modicum of trust. However, the long-term trend of heightened geopolitical tension between the two powers remains.
Chip competition.
Trade conflicts and tariffs have remained the status quo for the U.S. and China, and these tensions could be encapsulated by the ongoing semiconductor competition between the two economies. The current U.S. administration has further stepped up trade controls on sensitive industries, with semiconductors being a key area of focus. Even though China has for years poured resources into building up its domestic capabilities, it remains heavily dependent on imports for most of its semiconductor needs, especially in the most advanced chips, most of which are produced in Taiwan. On the flipside, the U.S. is attempting to increase domestic self-sufficiency in semiconductors. Despite key global producers setting up plants onshore in the U.S., it would likely take immense amounts of time and resources for that capability to be built up in the U.S. (and the product would likely be at a higher cost).Supply chain redirection
. Capital flows are likely to continue reorienting and supply chains will likely continue to shift and diversify as companies seek to reduce concentration risks. These changes create a structural tailwind for a number of emerging markets, and one of the most notable beneficiaries in Asia is India, where fundamental demographic tailwinds are likely to continue through the coming decade, with a young and educated population helping the economy climb up the value chain and consumption ladder. Reform efforts, such as the corporate tax cuts commenced in previous years, are also helping. Low-cost manufacturing economies in Southeast Asia could also benefit. Vietnam is a particular highlight, with many regarding it as a key supplement or even replacement for Chinese manufacturing capacity. However, the general macro outlook is likely to remain muted in the near-term in light of slowing global growth.1
PB Outlook figures shown are the midpoint of our view with a range of +/-10 basis points.
Investment Implications
Asia equities
The multitude of headwinds impacting earnings in the Asian region are slowly easing. The U.S. Dollar seems to be peaking, semiconductor-related earnings are becoming more realistic, and recent policy shifts in China could drive an earnings recovery in 2023, albeit backend loaded. With developed markets likely to be heading into recession in 2023, equity returns are likely to stay volatile and bumpy during 1H23. Higher interest rates also weigh on equity valuations and we maintain a below historical average P/E outlook of 11.0x.
Updated views on China equities
China equity markets enjoyed a strong rally in the past two months. MSCI China rebounded by more than 40% from an October 2022 bottom, while the Renminbi also keeps strengthening. We argued earlier that the worst was behind us, the corner has turned, and our index outlooks were biased to the upside. We also highlighted that in order to turn even more bullish, positive developments in four areas were necessary: further loosening of mobility restrictions, more supportive property measures, easing in geopolitical tensions and economic stimulus. Arguably the policy U-turn has happened at a much faster pace than anyone’s imagination. Together with more recent regulatory loosening towards the internet sector (e.g. approval of Ant Financial’s USD1.5bn fund raising), these favorable market developments have led to improved market sentiment and liquidity inflows, driving the forward P/E to rebound to long-term averages of approximately 11.5x. We strongly recommend the re-opening theme and inexpensive internet companies, and acknowledge the broad market is a buy-on-dip market thanks to further fiscal, monetary and regulatory policy shifts.
Upgrading Korea and Taiwan
After declining 24% in 2022, the South Korean equity market offers an attractive risk/reward profile as we head into 2023, in our view. The region continues to be heavily influenced by the DRAM memory cycle that we believe is in a bottoming process. DRAM prices have already corrected for 16 months, inline with the median duration of prior peak-to-trough cycles, and arguably, DRAM didn’t have a meaningful upcycle leading into this downcycle. In addition, the industry is now highly consolidated, and companies are meaningfully lowering capex linked to future supply growth. This could allow the DRAM market to rebalance more quickly, and prior upcycles in DRAM (following cycle troughs) have handsomely rewarded investors with solid double-digit returns.
We have higher conviction that the semiconductor cycle is bottoming out, which could benefit Taiwan. The global semiconductor sector suffered from a significant correction in 2022, mainly dragged by a massive de-rating in 1H22 likely due to rate hikes and in anticipation of negative earnings revisions as demand significantly weakened. Inventory peaked at the end of 2Q22. The unfavorable de-stocking cycle started in 3Q22 and likely will persist into 1H23. Companies announcing capex cuts is typically another strong signal – and this has occurred with many industry players. Earnings estimates for the major semiconductor companies in the region are now more realistic, and we expect the semi-cycle to bottom sometime in 1H23.
Asia Credits
Within Asia credits, we continue to prefer investment grade (IG) over high yield (HY). Asia IG’s benchmark yield of over 5% along with a relatively short duration of less than 5 years indicate an attractive carry return for investors.One of our top themes are credits issued by large China tech firms (i.e. China TMT) given strong credit fundamentals with solid balance sheets, low leverage, strong cash flow generation, reduced regulatory uncertainties and stable earnings. Current valuations could offer an opportunity of ~30bps of tightening in spreads.
Reopening in China will likely be a key driver of the market this year. The China recovery basket remains our high conviction among China credits. We see opportunities in China TMT BBB, China ex-property BB HY and Hong Kong credits given relatively solid balance sheets and attractive valuations. In terms of China financials, we hold a neutral view as solid credit fundamentals and strong demand by institutional and onshore investors offset rich valuations. For China property, backed by continued concrete policy support from the local and central government, as well as actually liquidity support which has been placed, we upgrade our view on the sector from negative to neutral. Having said that, weakened credit fundamentals and an offshore maturity wall in 1H23 would put more pressure on high yield privately-owned developers. We prefer state-owned developers and selective strong privately-owned developers, with land banks in higher-tier cities, commercial property businesses and diversified funding channels.
Outside China, in the IG space, we have a neutral view on Indian NBFI (non-bank financial institutions) given improved liquidity, but see limited upside on Southeast Asian sovereign/quasi-sovereign papers given rich valuations and a weaker economy during a recession. In the HY space, we see opportunities in Indian HY renewables and airports.
Asia FX
After a year of synchronized weakness against the dollar, 2023 sets a stage for a more differentiated stance. As we start the year, elevated energy prices and a global goods export downturn will likely continue to present BOP challenges to economies across the region. While U.S. yields may be peaking, rates differentials are still far from rosy for EM FX in general, though dispersion could emerge on idiosyncratic forces. As we move through the year, we may be able to see the global manufacturing downcycle gradually bottom out, and along with boosts from China’s reopening, more opportunities may emerge in 2H.
As for the RMB, the rapid reopening progress has significantly boosted sentiment recently. But as we head further into 2023, it could become less of a tailwind as the resumption of outbound tourism could be a durable negative adjustment to the balance of payments. In addition, the PBOC will likely maintain an accommodative policy stance and the low/negative carry of RMB looks set to continue. These imply that the RMB will likely trade weaker, especially relative to a basket of currencies.Index definition:

https://privatebank.jpmorgan.com/gl/en/insights/investing/why-consider-a-circular-economy,"A circular economy is defined as an upgraded production and consumption model for goods production, consumption and disposal that ensures sustainable growth over time. Right now, the world operates in what is called a linear economy; a model that has can have significant negative impact on our world. Follow along below to learn more about how we operate today, how we can operate tomorrow and the potential investment opportunity a circular economy offers investors.Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.
Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.The circular economy wants to change all this by designing and producing goods in a way that creates no waste or pollution in the first place, keeps them in use for longer, provides for efficient recycling and regenerates the natural environment. This sustainable economic system could yield enormous environmental, social and economic benefits across the world.Cities occupy only 2% of land on earth, but they account for 75% of natural resource consumption, 50% of global waste and 60% *of greenhouse gas emissions.³̶⁰Consequences of a linear economy
These are the consequences of our current linear economy, which operates on a framework that is resource intensive, and a take-make-use-waste model.It is not sustainable.10 billion tonnes of materials
are consumed per year and over 90% are wasted.
1
2.5 billion tonnes of food
every year are lost and wasted across the whole supply chain. This is enough to feed the world’s 870 million undernourished eight times over.
3300 million tonnes of plastic waste
are produced every year. That’s nearly equivalent to the weight of the entire human population.
2
Millions of tonnes of clothes
are produced, worn, and thrown away each year and every second; the equivalent of a rubbish truck load of clothes is burnt or buried in landfill.
4The Circular Economy Action Agenda identifies five major opportunities associated with the shift to a circular economy:
528%
cut in material use of finite resources
639%
emissions reduction
680%
reduction in ocean plastic waste to protect biodiversity and human health by 2040
7$4.5 TRILLION
economic opportunity by 2030
86 MILLION
net new jobs could be created by 2030
9How can we make circular economy a reality?Investing in the circular economy
Opportunities to invest in the circular economy are also growing rapidly as more companies, governments and consumers are motivated to find new business models, policies, and consumption patters that support a more circular economy.
The public equity markets offer the opportunity to invest directly in funds targeting environmental solutions or in investment strategies that take sustainability or environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into consideration. Public debt markets offer municipal bonds that finance infrastructure supporting water, recycling and waste, as well as Green bonds, which support sustainability-related projects.
In the private sector, venture capital helps fund early-stage companies that are developing innovative technologies or services to advance the principles of a circular economy. Private equity funding is critical as companies mature from early-stage entrepreneurship and need to scale their products or services offerings.Redefine waste
The current linear economy leaves a long trail of waste, starting with byproducts and emissions from the manufacturing process itself, carried on by single‑use packaging and ending with a discarded, often underutilized, finished product in a landfill. The circular economy seeks to design out waste from the start, where 80% of environmental impacts are determined,
10
and create “closed loops” to keep materials flowing through the system. A closed‑loop system reuses byproducts as future inputs, runs on renewable energy and sources from recycled materials. The shorter or tighter a loop, the better because it typically yields the most savings by reducing costs, such as labor and energy.
In a circular economy, many industries will transition to service-oriented/sharing models from the prevailing asset ownership models. In the case of autos, this shift could significantly increase the efficient use of resources (fewer cars per capita need to be produced, saving raw materials and fuel) while also reducing pollution.
The environment benefits significantly, as relative to production, remanufacturing uses 80% less energy, 85% less water, 92% less chemical products and 70% less waste.
11Retaining value from repairing to recycling
Extending the useful life of products also combats underutilization. To that end, there is a push to have producers and consumers:
Repair:
Figuring out ways to maintain products, rather than quickly discarding them or even recycling them, offers the highest value.
Reuse:
Product reuse and redistribution is viewed as the next best option to maintaining existing products.
Refurbish:
Repair and/or replace failed parts so a product can remain in use.
Recycle:
Investment in innovative technologies and processes is helping many companies incorporate recycling and recycled materials into their production.Plastics: A hundred-billion-dollar opportunity to reuse and recycle
Global companies, from retailers to plastics manufacturers, are setting high targets for plastics recycling, recycled and recyclable content, and recovery. For example, Sealed Air has pledged to make its packaging solutions 100% recyclable or reusable by 2025. The company has also set a goal of 50% average recycled content across all packaging solutions, of which 60% is post consumer recycled content.
12
One of the drivers of these goals is the unsustainable practice of shipping plastic waste overseas, whereby developed countries are exporting shipping containers of plastic to developing countries, mostly in Asia.New demand for recycled plastics could reach 5 to 7.5 million metric tons by 2030. If plastic recycling technologies can meet market demands, they have potential revenue opportunities of US$120 billion in the United States and Canada, alone.
More than 40 companies with technologies to recycle used plastic into new plastic are operating pilot and commercial scale plants in these two countries today, or have plans to do so in the next two years.
13
Many of them will partner with larger firms and investors to develop and scale their technologies. Unilever, in partnership with CreaSolv® Process and the Fraunho Institute for Process Engineering and Packaging IVV, has developed a new technology to recover the plastic from the hundreds of billions of plastic sachets that are thrown away every year and use it to create new sachets for Unilever products, making it a fully circular approach.
14
Reuse will also be essential to meeting the challenge of reducing single‑use packaging. Only about 14% of plastic packaging is collected for recycling, with just 2% recycled to a similar quality. After a short first‑use cycle, 95% of the material value of plastic packaging (roughly US$80 to 120 billion annually) is lost to the economy.
15
Replacing just 20% of single‑use plastic packaging with reusable alternatives, such as long‑use, refillable high‑end packaging, offers an opportunity worth at least US$10 billion.
16Not-so-fast fashion
Waste is a severe problem across the textile industry. More than USD $500 billion of value is lost every year and in 2018 the fashion industry produced 2.1 billion tonnes of CO2eq. This represents 4% of global carbon emissions—an emissions’ share larger than that of France, Germany and the United Kingdom combined. To align with the 1.5-degree pathway in 2030, 20% of garments need to be traded through circular business models.
17
Policy makers, investors and consumers are in support of this transition. In a recent McKinsey survey, more than three in five consumers said environmental impact is an important factor in making purchasing decisions.
18If the fashion industry were to address the environmental and social issues it faces by taking steps such as converting to a sustainable material mix, eliminating harmful chemicals, decreasing water use, and improving transparency and traceability, it could unlock a US$560 billion economic opportunity.
19
If not, fashion brands could face significant threats, including declines to profit margins.
Innovators across the industry can and are finding ways to reduce waste. For example, many are seeking to:
Reduce resources used, including raw materials as well as water and energy sources, in the manufacturing process. 75% of all Nike footwear and apparel incorporates recycled materials, and Nike Air Manufacturing Innovation facilities divert more than 95% of manufacturing waste from landfills.
20
They are implementing and scaling new design and manufacturing processes, with materials reclaimed throughout production and at the end of a product’s life.
Focus on the traceability of materials so companies can meet recycling standards. One innovative company has developed a chemical regeneration technology to transform post-consumer cotton garment waste into high-quality, cellulosic fiber.
21
Increase the durability of clothes, and the ability to repair them, as well as create secondary markets.More food for thought
Across the current linear food supply chain, 2.5 billion tonnes of food every year is lost and wasted. Food production and waste amounts to an estimated total GHG emissions of 13.7 gigatonnes/year
22
and an economic cost of US$5.7 trillion—for every dollar spent on food, society pays two dollars in health, environmental and economic costs.
23
In short, the current linear food system is enormously wasteful, drains resources and contributes to disease and pollution.A circular economy for food can overcome these challenges:
Source and produce food locally. By 2050, 80% of food will be consumed in cities. While the feasibility of urban farming systems is subject to debate, 40% of the world’s cropland is within 20 kilometers of cities.
24
Local sourcing increases the resilience of food supply chains, shortens distribution channels and reduces the need for excess packaging.
At the farm stage, use precision agriculture and regenerative practices, such as organic fertilizers, crop rotation, crop variation, rotational grazing, agro forestry and conservation agriculture. These methods can have a significant impact, as despite common perception, food loss and waste at the farm stage exceed that at the consumer stage. In fact, agriculture is responsible for 30% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and 80% of deforestation.
25
At the consumer stage, reduce and make use of food waste by redistributing edible food and using inedible food for fertilizer, biomaterials and bioenergy.
In Milan, Italy, municipal trucks (many powered by biodiesel) collect surplus food from households, commercial properties and schools, and transport it to an anaerobic digestion and composting plant. Once processed, biogas is injected into the local gas network and compost is used to fertilize farmland surrounding the city.Circular City
Cities have tremendous power to drive change toward more circular, closed-loop systems. Some of the ways cities can improve their efficiency and quality of life are to:Building materials
Redesign the way we construct building to make more efficient use of resources and energy. A circular economy could reduce global CO
2
emissions from buildings materials by 38% in 2050.
26
The Circular Building Toolkit recommends a number of strategies, including build nothing, build long-term value, build efficiency and build with right materials.
27
Water conservation
Improve water conservation and treatment systems to conserve water within city limits. Recovering energy in the wastewater sector can actually offset the energy required for treatment: A Hungarian-base company, Biopolus, has created a modular urban water treatment system to harness clean water, energy, nutrients and minerals from wastewater and organic waste.
29Renewable energy
Use renewable energy, including bioenergy that can be recycled from food and other organic waste in Amsterdam fround that using biorefineries, waste separation and return logistics could lead to added value of 150 million, as well as 900,000 tons of material savings and a reduction of 600,000 tons CO
2
emissions annually for the city.
28
Electric vehicles
Reduce the need for vehicles (and shift to electric-powered ones) by improving public transportation and bycycle infrastructure within cities.While the obstacles to a transition to a circular economy are numerous, so are the opportunities and potential benefits to our world.
It will take a strong partnership between individuals, businesses and governments to make the circular economy a reality. If successful, this transition could be a multi‑trillion‑dollar opportunity
31
that brings a 39% reduction in green house gas emissions.

Welcome to the final edition of Asia Strategy Weekly for 2022. It has been a tough year for investors – adverse supply shocks pushed global inflation dramatically higher, and the fight by central banks against inflation led to significantly higher interest rates and tighter financial conditions. Economic growth also disappointed across developed and emerging markets. This challenging macro mix resulted in one of the worst years ever for multi-asset portfolios. Both stocks and bonds suffered big losses, leaving investors virtually no place to hide. Heading into 2023, we see many of the dynamics that have driven markets this year shifting – the reset in valuations will likely create the one of the most attractive entry points for multi-asset investors in over a decade. Check out our
2023 Outlook
for more.
This week, risk assets were initially higher on the back of lower-than-expected inflation data in the U.S. but finished lower as attention back shifted to recession concerns. November headline CPI in the U.S. posted its smallest month-on-month increase in 15 months. Stripping out food and energy, “core” inflation also came in below market expectations. Details in the CPI report suggest that supply chain issues continued to recede – used car prices fell 2.9% on the month, driving overall goods inflation negative. Shelter inflation also slowed from the previous month, though mostly driven by a drop in hotel prices. Rents continued to edge up, though some leading indicators suggest that rental inflation may have passed the peak. This print supports our outlook that inflation in the U.S. will likely continue to cool as the impact of higher rates feeds through the economy.Despite the optimistic inflation data, Chair Powell’s statements at the Wednesday press conference still skewed hawkish. He continued to signal that more hikes are on the way, and that cuts will not be considered until inflation is sustainably heading lower. He also didn't think the past two encouraging CPI prints were a reason to shift the outlook on inflation, and repeatedly came back to the risk of strong wage growth driving entrenched inflation. This view is based on the fact that service prices remain strong and if not for the fall in car prices and airfares, core inflation would have stayed in the range of 0.4% MoM. The updated dot plot also suggested an increase in hiking expectations. Despite the hawkish tone, rates actually fell across the curve. Interestingly, two-year yields are now below the mid-point of the current funds rate – and effectively the bond market isn’t ready to buy the idea that the Fed will actually get the policy rate to what the dots currently show.
Elsewhere in the market, the dollar continued to fall on upbeat risk sentiment. Crude oil reversed last week’s torrid performance as investors reacted to positive news regarding re-opening in China, as well as supply uncertainty – namely the shutdown of the Keystone pipeline in the U.S. and the recently imposed G7 price cap on Russian oil exports. We expect energy commodities to be higher in 2023 despite recession risks, and China will likely be one of the dominating factors in play.
Strategy Question: What is the market impact of China reopening?
Since late November, China’s Covid control measures have been eased at a rapid pace with further relaxations announced almost on a daily basis. Implementations do vary at the local level, but broadly speaking, mandatory mass nucleic-acid tests are quickly being phased out, intra and inter-city travels are resuming without quarantine and testing restrictions, and contact tracing has more or less ceased. The policy focus has shifted to managing healthcare resources for severe cases and educating the public on at-home recovery for light symptoms.
While there are still some uncertainties – for example, when cases will peak, and whether the healthcare system can manage the rising caseload, it is nonetheless important to recognize that changes are happening. The speed and manner of China’s exit from Zero Covid will likely mean that the Chinese economy is turning the corner. While we have previously assumed some degree of consumption recovery in 2023, the gradual re-opening underway right now will likely have a more positive impact on consumer as well as business sentiment.
After this winter, mobility restrictions will likely be further rolled back substantially. Consumption will likely recover as consumers resume gathering with friends, and businesses trips restart. Healthcare spending could also grow again, after three years of exclusive focus on Covid. But goods spending growth, particularly household goods will likely remain weak due to the drag from the housing sector.With re-opening, economic growth will likely bottom this winter, across Q4 2022 and Q1 2023. In 2023, economic growth will likely be driven by the recovery in the capacity utilization rate in the service sector. As demand improves, spare capacity across various service sectors, from transportation (flight, metro, road), to retail, wholesale, and logistics will likely normalize from the currently depressed state (most are operating at below 50% of pre-pandemic levels). The offsetting factors are a still weak housing sector as well as the export slowdown. Recently there have been a lot of policies aimed at helping developers refinance in order to continue with home construction. While these have not lifted home sales, with falling mortgage rates and more economic stability afforded by the exit from Zero Covid, housing sales could gradually find a bottom through the course of 2023. On the export front, our expectations are for a bigger downturn in global growth in 2023 (with a U.S. recession starting in Q3 2023). Both the housing downturn and exports are likely going to be a net drag on growth in 2023, but could start to fade out in 2024.RMB: balance of payment challenges and unattractive carry could continue to pressure the currency
The RMB has been benefiting from positive growth sentiment related to re-opening. But as we head further into 2023, it could become less of a tailwind as international travel resumes, bringing more outbound tourism. The global growth downturn will also likely accelerate in 2023. Since the PBOC will likely maintain an accommodative policy stance, the low/negative carry of RMB will likely continue. These imply that the RMB will likely trade weaker, relative to a basket of currencies.China equities: Near-term upside mostly front-loaded; consider accelerating phase-in after an 8-10% pullback
With the positive policy development, the light at the end of the tunnel is more visible and China equity markets have turned from a bear market into a trading market, and with an upside bias. However, we also believe that most of the near-term positive news could have been priced in or even front-loaded, leaving limited near-term upside. This sharp U-turn of Covid policy at a much faster-than-expected pace has led us to raise our China index outlook. For MSCI China, our new year-end 2023 index outlook is 66-69 (from 58-62), implying a mild 2-8% upside. As for CSI 300, our year-end 2023 outlook of 4,000-4,250 (from 3,800-4,100) implies 1-7% upside. We expect the A-share market to maintain its relative defensiveness and highly policy-driven nature in 2023.Although we expect a continuous easing of Covid measures, corporate earnings are likely to be subdued in the next 1-2 quarters as the re-opening effect takes time to carry over. Our 2023E MSCI China EPS growth forecast stays unexciting at ~5% for now. Looking beyond Covid-related re-opening, in the coming months investors will likely refocus on the pace of growth reacceleration and property recovery, which are less controllable than Covid policies. Post-opening, hospital loads and mortality rates are also key indicators to closely monitor. Nonetheless, we are increasingly of the view that 8-10% pullbacks will likely be bought as a critical corner seems to have turned.
Turn your attention to the next stages of re-opening
Investors may focus on China re-opening names to ride on this faster-than-expected change. There are three stages to a full re-opening: Stage one – domestic re-opening; stage two – re-opening to Hong Kong and Macau; and stage three – re-opening to the world. As the stage one domestic re-opening is largely played out, we recommend positioning for the second and third stage of reopening. We don't favor chasing the high-flyers, but to accumulate the laggards. Even after the recent strong rebound, many of the re-opening plays remain inexpensive and trade on a 30%+ discount to their pre-Covid levels. Broadly speaking, investors may raise cash and get ready to accelerate their investments after seeing an 8-10% pullback (or utilize structured products to start positioning).All market and economic data as of December 15, 2022 and sourced from Bloomberg Finance L.P. and FactSet unless otherwise stated.

Our Top Market Takeaways for February 17, 2023
Market update
No love lost on inflation
It’s getting warmer.
Another week of strong economic data prints sent bond yields surging while equities zigzagged.
Tuesday’s U.S. CPI print was the main event. The numbers for January came in broadly as expected—headline prices grew at a +0.5% m/m pace and core +0.4% m/m—but the details suggest a stickier inflation picture than many had presumed.
Under the hood, energy and used auto prices fell on the month, but there is still upward pressure coming from services inflation. Shelter (think rent) prices accounted for nearly half of the monthly increase in headline prices. But given that real-time rent indicators suggest this will ease in the months ahead, the key piece of the puzzle really lies with services ex-shelter inflation, which is still running at a pace that is too brisk for comfort.
This, coupled with the recent strong jobs report, retail sales and housing data, has materially shifted market expectations for how much the Federal Reserve will have to hike rates. Investors now expect policymakers to reach a rate of 5.3% (with just one cut thereafter), compared to 4.8% (with two cuts by year-end) just two weeks ago. In our view, this all increases the odds that the Fed will keep hiking and remain in restrictive territory for longer.
Across the pond, stocks in Europe continued to march higher thanks to an improving energy situation and tailwinds from China’s reopening. The Stoxx Europe 600 headed into Friday with a clean sweep of days in the green for the week—now up more than 20% from September lows.
All in all, it’s been quite a start to the new year! Economic data seems strong, equity markets have rallied even though bond yields are still high, it hasn’t snowed in New York City, and fighter jets had to shoot down UFOs on Super Bowl Sunday. It seems like a lot to keep track of, so we wanted to take a stab at answering some
frequently asked questions
.
Spotlight
Quick answers to top questions
Is the economy re-accelerating?
In the words of Lee Corso, not so fast, my friend! Our take is that the January data we have seen signal a solid growth backdrop for now, not a re-acceleration. While the retail sales and labor market data crushed expectations, we are wary of seasonal adjustment issues that flatter the picture. First, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has had some trouble around holiday periods, especially during COVID. The extreme strength in restaurants and department stores after notable weakness in November and December makes us take the data with a grain of salt. Further, January was warmer than usual, which is good for economic activity. Warm weather can support establishments such as restaurants and auto dealers relative to “typical” January conditions. In all, the Economic Surprise Index is signaling that the economy is doing just a touch better than most economists expected, but we hesitate to call it a re-acceleration.Is the Fed making a mistake by easing up on markets?
Again, cue Lee. Not so fast, my friend! The key takeaway: Rates are still high enough to keep growth below trend. Some of the best arguments are that the housing market is still as unaffordable relative to median incomes as it has been since 1990, bank lending standards are tight (which hampers capex and manufacturing activity), and non-mortgage consumer interest payments are rising. On that last point, credit card interest rates are above 20%! The path back down the 2% inflation is going to be bumpy, but we think the Fed’s path that is reflected in the rates market will be enough to eventually work.Will the recent equity rally hold?
Given lower near-term recession risks and improving fundamentals for many parts of the market relative to last year, we think the equity rally has been fair, and we feel good about the asset class over the next year and beyond. That said, risks remain: Inflation is still high and the Fed still has its foot on the brake. We are cautious of choppy trading over the coming months. The good news is that recent strength has been accompanied by lower volatility, meaning that investors can buy protection more cheaply to hedge positions over the next 6–12 months.When is the muni market going to loosen up a bit?
Hopefully soon! Investors came into the year with an insatiable appetite for municipal bonds, which has made municipals look expensive relative to Treasury bonds (especially on the front end). But there are some signs that we could loosen up a bit soon. Some large new issue deals came to the market in the last few weeks, and the supply picture looks like it should keep getting better as we get into spring (March is a net positive supply month).
Are we thinking through the implications of possible UFO/extraterrestrial activity on the economic and market outlook?
No, but the last three years in markets have taught us to never say never…All market and economic data as of February 2023 and sourced from Bloomberg Finance L.P. and FactSet unless otherwise stated.

As expected, the Federal Reserve raised the policy rate by 25bps at its first policy meeting in 2023. Three points stood out to us – the Fed showed little concern about the recent loosening of financial conditions; Powell recognized that a disinflationary process is underway for the first time; and new economic forecasts will tell us more in March. These messages further signaled that the central bank is getting closer to the end of the tightening cycle. Markets reacted positively with higher stocks, lower treasury yields and a weaker dollar.
The development has been in line with our outlook. While Powell still warned about “ongoing increases” in the Fed Funds rate, it sounded like we could see a downgrade to the inflation forecast in March and likely a reduction of the terminal rate. We continue to believe that the Fed will likely start easing towards the end of this year. To express this view, we favor extending duration in fixed income portfolios and shorting the dollar, especially against the “low-yielders”.
Strategy Question: How do you trade USD weakness?
Massive moves in the FX market have been a major focus for investors of late. The Dollar Index (commonly referred to as the DXY index) has shed over 10% since its highs in late September, following a historic +27% rally in the last year and a half. As we mentioned in our 2023 Outlook, we expect dollar weakness to be one of the key themes of macro trades this year. So why is this the case? And how may investors play the theme now?
To understand why weakness in the U.S. dollar could be a sustained trend, it’s helpful to look at what happened in 2022. During 1H, the Fed started hiking aggressively – at a pace that hadn’t been seen in the past 40 years – in the face of a large inflation overshoot. USD rates shot up much quicker than other major currencies. A wider interest rate differential in favor of the U.S. drove a rally in the dollar. In 2H, other central banks started to catch up in terms of hiking rates, but the global growth environment was incredibly weak. In particular, China was going through rolling lockdowns. Europe was facing a potentially very deep energy crisis. Global equity market declines had also deepened. This drove another leg of dollar strength as investors sought a safe haven. The confluence of factors drove the dollar to highly overvalued levels – as much as 20% higher than its modeled fair value (based on 5-year interest rate differentials) at the peak.What we’ve been seeing the last few months – and what we expect to continue into 2023 – is the erosion of all these pillars that pushed the dollar stronger in 2022. Interest rate expectations are peaking in the U.S. but still rising in the rest of the developed world. In other words, rate differentials have started to turn from a support for the dollar to a headwind. Looking ahead, USD rates will likely continue to “catch down” to other developed markets as U.S. inflation trends lower and the Fed reaches the end of its hiking cycle. Meanwhile, with inflation staying sticky in Europe and picking up in Japan, policy directions of these central banks are more likely to tilt towards the hawkish side. From an asset allocation standpoint, with the disappearance of negative yielding debt in Europe and Japan – and U.S. equities perhaps no longer outperforming global indices – we could start to see a rebalancing of U.S. asset overweights in global portfolios.
Global growth dynamics, the second pillar of dollar strength in 2022, are also shifting. The reopening in China has been faster than expected. In Europe, this winter has turned out to be less cold than had been feared, and natural gas prices have fallen 70% from the peak. Increasingly, the U.S. is looking less exceptional from a growth perspective.
Add in the fact that the U.S. dollar still screens 10% overvalued, and we see some further weakness ahead.
How to trade USD weakness?
Positioning for a weaker dollar generally happens in two stages: First, currencies and precious metals that tend to provide lower growth and yield (like the Euro, Japanese yen, Swiss franc, and gold, aka the “low yielders”) tend to strengthen. And later, when the global economy demonstrates full-on early cycle dynamics, higher-growth-oriented currencies (like commodity FX and emerging markets, aka the “high beta”) will likely join the rally in a more sustained way.
We are currently in the first stage.
Here are a few ways that we favor participating in this trade:
1. The Euro
The Euro recently rebounded from sub-parity against the dollar to levels seen before the Ukraine crisis. The worst fears for the winter period have not played out, and we have seen large declines in natural gas prices. We still see upside in the Euro from here in the near term. The market is pricing the European Central Bank to hike rates above 3.25% this year. This shift in interest rate differentials is consistent with fair value for EURUSD above 1.15. However, we’d note that energy prices will need to remain benign for us to really see the shift towards fair value. Otherwise, some Europe-specific risk premium will likely stay.2. The Japanese yen
Moves in USDJPY are closely correlated with interest rate differentials. Over the past two years, changes in the spread between 10-year U.S. treasury yields and 10-year JGB yields explain 80-90% of the moves in USDJPY. Over the recent months, traders started to bet on higher JPY rates (as shown by the spikes in the swap rate), especially after the surprise announcement by the BOJ to widen the yield curve control (YCC) band in late December. While the BOJ meeting in January underwhelmed the market by leaving all monetary policy settings unchanged, the longer-term trajectory is still highly JPY supportive, in our view. The currency remains undervalued especially given that rate differentials look poised to continue to narrow. Core inflation in Japan recently rose to almost two times the BOJ target, and with wage inflation rising, the composition of inflation pressure has shifted from mostly imported to more home-grown, which is a sign of stickier inflation from here. Eventually the central bank would have to think about further normalization in monetary policies.3. Gold
While the functionality of gold as an inflation hedge is being increasingly questioned, the yellow metal could shine again this year. Historically, gold prices usually gain support from a weaker dollar and lower real yields. With yields peaking in the U.S., the trough in gold could be behind us, with the metal joining the rally of the low yielders. We favor gold not only as a way to participate in the weaker dollar trend, but also from a portfolio diversification standpoint.
Does RMB fit in this trade?
The RMB is getting strong support from improved sentiment thanks to the rapid reopening in China and continued inflows as global portfolios close their large underweights in Chinese assets. Coupled with broad weakness in the dollar, USDCNH declined from a high of above 7.3 to 6.7 levels. However, long CNH is still not how we would express the China re-opening theme (we would rather focus on equities and credits, as discussed in
a recent article
). Negative carry and risks of further deterioration in the balance of payments as we move through the year suggest that not all CNH-negative factors are neutralized. As the slowdown in goods demand from U.S. and European consumers continues, China’s exports will likely deteriorate from high teens growth over the past two years to a significant contraction this year. At the same time, outflows could see a boost if outbound tourism resumes. Given these factors and how fast CNH has moved, we don’t favor it as a way to trade dollar weakness from here. For dollar-based investors looking to add exposure to CNY-denominated assets, one strategy would be to hedge out FX risks and lock in a positive carry.All market and economic data as of February 2, 2023 and sourced from Bloomberg Finance L.P. and FactSet unless otherwise stated.

RISK CONSIDERATIONS
Investments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities, particularly if the instruments involve leverage. The value of commodity-linked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements, commodity index volatility, changes in interest rates, or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity, such as drought, floods, weather, livestock disease, embargoes, tariffs and international economic, political and regulatory developments. Use of leveraged commodity-linked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but, at the same time, creates the possibility for greater loss.​
Holders of foreign securities can be subject to foreign exchange risk, exchange-rate risk and currency risk, as exchange rates fluctuate between an investment’s foreign currency and the investment holder’s domestic currency. Conversely, it is possible to benefit from favorable foreign exchange fluctuations.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.You can find higher yields and better protection against recession and equity declines in a variety of fixed income strategies in 2023.Fixed income markets battered investor portfolios in 2022. The Barclays
Global Aggregate Bond Index returned -17.7%, its worst performance since 1980. As global central banks unwound their unprecedented easy monetary policies, there was virtually no place to hide.
But today the picture looks very different. After the fastest U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) tightening cycle on record, fixed income markets now offer very attractive forward-looking returns. Higher yields (e.g., the 10-year U.S. Treasury Bond yielded Ensure index returns are all defined at the end of the article. This is defined at the end 3.6%
1
at the time of writing, versus 1.6% at the start of 2022) mean investors can now find more substantial levels of income. At the same time, fixed income can offer valuable protection—protection against the effects of a recession, and against declines in the prices of equities and other risk assets.
As global growth slows and inflation cools, we see a very supportive environment for a wide range of fixed income investments.
Here, we highlight five of our top-conviction strategies: short duration corporate bonds; longer duration core fixed income; United States over Europe; investment grade (IG) over high yield (HY); and private credit. Across sectors and styles, we expect the renewed potential for active management to deliver alpha (excess returns above an index benchmark).
Consider the following fixed income strategies as you revisit your investment portfolio and evaluate if you are on track to meet your family’s financial goals.
Short duration corporate bonds: Well above cash yields
For investors looking to achieve both income and total return goals, we believe short duration
2
investment grade bonds, with maturities 1–3 years, may deliver some of the most reliable risk-adjusted returns in any financial markets over the next 12 to 24 months.The 2022 market selloff means that the level of yield available in short duration fixed income comfortably exceeds the yield available in cash or liquidity markets. For example, a U.S. 3-year investment grade corporate bond yields ~5% versus 4.4% for a USD prime money market fund. In the euro area, the 1–3 year IG Corporate Bond Index yields 3.7%, and a prime money market fund yields around 1.8%.
What’s more, it does so with relatively little risk. Between 1920 and 2020, the average default rate of investment grade bonds was just 0.14% according to Moody’s Investor Services.
Longer duration: Yield, capital appreciation, portfolio diversification
Adding longer-duration core fixed income is another high conviction strategy. We believe this approach now offers portfolio diversification, attractive yield and the potential for capital appreciation.
This view reflects our economic and policy outlook. We see a growing risk that as the Fed focuses on fighting inflation, it will keep policy rates too high for too long as the U.S. economy slips into recession in the second half of this year. By the fourth quarter, we expect the Fed to cut rates by 25 basis points.
During the recession, we think the Fed will make further cuts, eventually leading to a long term neutral policy rate of around 2.5%. When rates fall, bond prices rise—and they rise proportionately more for the longer-dated bonds that make up the core fixed income sector. Given where long-term US interest rates are trading today (~3.7%), we see an opportunity for core fixed income to generate capital gains if our view proves correct and the Fed does indeed cut rates.
It’s a different story in Europe. Given the ongoing inflationary pressures on the euro area economy, we don’t expect the European Central Bank (ECB) to cut rates anytime before 2024. As a result, we anticipate less impressive returns for the European Aggregate versus its U.S. counterpart.
Finally, with growing evidence that inflation is moving steadily lower, we believe stocks and bonds will revert to their traditional negative correlation this year: moving in opposite directions. Core fixed income could thus offer protection against the equity price declines that often accompany the early stages of a recession.
IG over HY: Better quality, better pricing
High yield bonds look quite expensive while investment grade seems attractively priced. HY spreads (their excess yield over government debt) are well below their long-term average. We think this is partly because the extra  yield offered by HY bonds does not adequately reflect the risk of increased HY bond defaults in a recession.
At the same time, IG spreads are trading at or above their long-term averages, particularly in Europe. While the extra yields IG corporate bonds offer are at average levels, absolute yields (which are mostly driven by the level of government interest rates) are at decade highs.Credit risk metrics also remain much stronger in the IG space. Many companies locked in cheap long- term funding and are using the elevated levels of inflation to underpin still-robust profit margins. Bank balance sheets (the financial sector makes up about half of all IG debt) remain in solid shape.
For investors looking for lower default risks and a higher potential upside, we believe the risk-reward available in IG makes it more attractive than HY, especially if yields start to fall in 2H 2023.
United States over Europe: A better inflation outlook
In both investment grade and high yield bond markets, we prefer U.S. over European credit. Although spreads on European bonds are wider than their U.S. counterparts, they come with higher risk.  Our preference for U.S. credit reflects the different economic outlooks for the United States and Europe, especially on the inflation front.
The energy shock that followed from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine hit Europe especially hard, given its much greater reliance on Russian energy. Euro area inflation rose quickly, and growth slowed sharply. Inflation in Europe is predominantly a supply side phenomenon, while U.S. inflation is more demand driven. As a result, ECB rate hikes will likely be less effective at slowing the rate of inflation than Fed hikes targeted at demand-led price gains.
The lower level of interest rates in Europe suggests European IG will likely generate lower returns than U.S. IG. It is much the same story in HY. Although European HY issuers are generally of better quality than their U.S. counterparts (with a lower projected rate of default), lower rates in the euro area may ultimately deliver lower returns.
Private credit
Beyond public fixed income markets, private credit also remains attractive. However, choosing where to invest, and whom to invest with, matters more than ever.
Banks and traditional lenders have focused their attention on the largest loans in the market. That leaves alternative lenders, including private credit funds, as the main source of lending to small and mid-sized companies. This demand creates an attractive environment for private credit funds.
However, as rising volatility and higher interest rates (among other factors) impact the market, default rates are likely to increase. This makes it critical for investors to focus on experienced managers with a strong ability to underwrite risk and identify quality loans.
As the aforementioned market factors increase default risk for lower quality loans, we believe there is opportunity here as well. In such cases of market dislocation, savvy special situations and distressed fund managers can find good value, especially where the market is mispricing risk.
Whether it is direct lending or distressed lending, the breadth of the credit market today presents multiple approaches for investment.
Conclusion
As the global economy appears headed for recession later this year, we view fixed income markets as very attractive additions to many investment portfolios. Helped by active management’s potential for delivering excess returns, we believe short duration credit, longer duration core bonds, United States (over Europe), investment grade (over high yield) and private credit are promising opportunities to consider at a time of economic uncertainty.

Recent growth and inflation numbers, the majority of which have surprised on the upside, have been the key drivers of market movements. The data has materially shifted market expectations for how much the Federal Reserve will have to hike rates. Investors now expect policymakers to reach a rate of 5.3% (with just one cut thereafter), compared to 4.8% (with two cuts by year-end) just two weeks ago. In our view, this all increases the odds that the Fed will keep hiking and remain in restrictive territory for longer. These stronger numbers have shifted the market narrative towards one of soft landing (or even no landing), suggesting the U.S. economy can withstand rates at current and even eventually higher levels. We are not buyers of the soft/no landing narrative. We still think rates are still high enough to keep growth below trend, importantly, eventually leading to a recession, lower inflation, and lower bond yields. Bolstering this view is the fact that the housing market is as unaffordable relative to median incomes as it has been since 1990. Bank lending standards are tight (which hampers capex and manufacturing activity) and non-mortgage consumer interest payments are rising. On that last point, credit card interest rates are above 20%! The path back down to 2% inflation is going to be bumpy, but we think the Fed’s path that is reflected in the rates market will likely be enough to eventually work.
Strategy Question: A new monetary regime in Japan?
In our experience Japanese markets are too often overlooked. Despite being one of the world’s largest economies with deep, liquid capital markets, years of negative yields and range-bound equity markets have conditioned many investors to instead focus on the faster growing markets of the U.S. or China. However, with many changes on the horizon including a new Bank of Japan Governor and potential shifts to monetary policy, now is an important time for global investors to pay attention to Japan’s monetary regime shift. This is primarily because the BoJ’s shift will have important implications for capital flows and the Yen as Japanese investors continue to rotate investments from foreign assets back to domestic debt. In other words, given the size of Japanese capital flows, shifts in monetary policy can have sustained spillovers into global liquidity conditions.
Will the new BOJ Governor signal a shift in policy?
The nomination of Mr. Kazuo Ueda as the next Bank of Japan governor was a surprise to many in the market and investors are now trying to get a handle on future policy shifts by parsing past actions and statements.
Currently working in academia, Professor Ueda used to serve as a BOJ board member from 1998 to 2005 and is a frequent panelist in BOJ economic policy workshops. Earning his PhD at MIT under Stanley Fischer (former Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve and dissertation advisor to former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke), Ueda is widely regarded as a pragmatist. In recent statements Ueda expressed concern on rising inflation and believed it is necessary to conduct a thorough review of the current easing framework, taking a potential exit strategy into account. However, he also expressed concerns over a quick tightening of policies, as it may negatively impact the economy and hinder the BOJ goal of raising interest rates by a sufficient amount over the longer run.
This suggests to us that Ueda will likely make policy decisions in a balanced manner, and keep policy moves well-paced.
Another focus area is Ueda’s attitude towards the Yield Curve Control (YCC) framework, which is one of the unorthodox monetary tools utilized by the BOJ. Ueda has publicly expressed concerns over the side effects of YCC, such as market disruptions and encouraging large-scale speculation. In terms of moves to change the framework, he once raised shortening the target maturity of yield control to five years, but later ruled out this possibility. He stated in a Nikkei interview last July that YCC should not be open to minor tweaking

,
which to us raises the likelihood that any eventual change on this front would likely be a major expansion of the +/- 50bps trading band for the 10-year JGB, if not a full abandonment of the policy.Japan’s macro landscape: inflation at 25 year high
While the personal views of policymakers matter, monetary policies ultimately reflect the realities in the economy. Development in Japan’s inflation dynamics are the key to watch. Core inflation has come in above the BOJ’s 2% target since April last year. While it does not imply an imminent response from the central bank, in our view it does mean a weaker case for continued massive easing.It’s also important to understand the drivers. The current rise in inflation is largely driven by the negative supply shock from an increase in food and energy prices globally (i.e. “imported inflation”). Over recent months it is becoming increasingly clear that the peak of commodity prices has arrived and disruptions in the global supply chain will likely continue to fade. However, we are seeing more signs of “homemade” inflation at the same time. As shown in the chart below, wage inflation has considerably strengthened. Most now expect that the rate of wage increases decided by the ongoing spring wage negotiation (the Shunto labor talks) will be meaningfully higher than last year. Koji Nakamura, head of the Monetary Affairs Department, recently noted that cost-push inflation has not optically led to any drop in aggregate demand and could create momentum for wage growth to accelerate. This may give way to higher core inflation for an extended period of time. Nonetheless, any slowdown in global growth would add another level of complexity to this outlook.Policy normalization likely slow and steady, an imminent hawkish shift is unlikely
In light of the new appointment and evolving inflation dynamics, we see high odds of BOJ policy normalization to start at some point this year. We think there is a chance we could see the YCC band being expanded to 1%, or an exit of the framework as early as this summer. However, we’d note that there is still a very long way to go before the BoJ’s monetary policy is fully normalized. Besides Ueda’s balanced perspectives, the fact that the Kishida administration reportedly initially offered the position to Amimaya – the most dovish candidate on the market’s radar – could be taken as a sign that a rushed hawkish shift in policies is not favored.
From here, we are closely watching a few upcoming events. Diet hearings on Ueda’s appointment, and those of the two deputy governors scheduled for February 24 and 27, are an opportunity for the market to further assess the upcoming governor’s views toward key economic issues and incumbent Governor Kuroda’s policy legacy. We could also see Kuroda tweaking forward guidance at his last Monetary Policy Meeting (MPM) on March 18-19, as Covid special operations are set to end in March. In addition, we could also get the first batch of results from the ongoing wage negotiation in mid March, and better assess the outlook for wage inflation.Investment opportunities and market implications
From a foreign exchange (FX) perspective, our assessment of BOJ’s policy path forward is in line with our 2023 outlook for USDJPY to end the year around 120, assuming that U.S. rates eventually come down and the 10-year JGB yields are ultimately allowed to go higher. Despite a lack of near-term catalysts before the Federal Reserve confirms the end to its hiking cycle, our medium-term expectation continues to be that the USD can trade weaker over the course of the year as U.S. growth and yields “catch down” to low-yielding G10 currencies, including the JPY. We encourage investors to explore derivative strategies with loss limited features to express the bullish view on JPY against the USD over the next 6-12 months.
Over the shorter term, with the direction of USD admittedly harder to call, we can focus more on USD-neutral expressions. As shown in the chart below, valuation of the JPY is still the most attractive among G10 currencies based on multiple factors. We particularly like long JPY strategies against risk-sensitive currencies with vulnerable growth and relatively dovish central banks, i.e. GBP, NOK, and CAD.
From an equity perspective, given the high percentage of company earnings from exports, Japanese equities collectively are likely to face headwinds from a weaker USDJPY. This is reflected in our 2023 year-end outlook for the TOPIX of 1,980-2,030, offering limited upside from current levels. That said, we believe attractive investment opportunities do exist for domestic companies geared towards Japan’s re-opening to international travelers, and financials that could benefit from Japan’s gradual exit from the extremely accommodative monetary policy.
Over the longer term, as Japan’s near-decade of zero, and then negative, rates enters its final chapter, the outflow of Japanese capital will also likely slow. This could have important implications for global liquidity. If and when the BoJ tolerates a further rise in yields, a reorientation in Japanese portfolio flows away from foreign assets and back to domestic debt could have important implications for those markets where exposure is highest. While Japan is the largest single foreign holder of US Treasuries, given the sheer size of the market a pull-back in Japanese flows would likely not be that impactful, but rather could be more visible in Australia and Europe, where exposure is highest as a share of the total market.1

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.How might you invest in global food market innovations that are designed to feed the world?Federico Cuevas, Global Investment Strategist
Much about what you eat is about to change dramatically. This transformation can create opportunities for you as an investor, possibly in ways you’ve yet to imagine.
Food is a growth industry. As the human population rises, the global food market has expanded to $10 trillion annually in revenue, representing close to 12% of the entire world’s GDP.
1
We believe multiple catalysts will cause seismic change throughout the food system.
While the worldwide revolution in the global food market is still in the early stages, change is expected to come rapidly. For investors, that can suggest opportunities—if you know where to look.
What is driving the revolution in the global food market?
Among the many forces changing the global food market are:
Demographics—
The world’s population is on track to increase from 8 billion today to 9.2 billion in 2040.
1
At the same time, millions are seeing their incomes rise, allowing them to increase and diversify their food consumption.
Geopolitics and climate change—
The impacts of climate change and the war in Ukraine, both of which are disrupting key food-producing areas, are causing food security to become an increasing concern.
2
Sustainable goals—
The United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals are organized around the five pillars of people, prosperity, planet, peace and partnership.
3
They include many environmental targets on subjects such as food and food supply. According to some estimates, changing the food supply chain to meet the UN’s environmental goals could generate close to $3.6 trillion of additional revenue or cost savings, and create 191 million new jobs by 2030.
4
,
5
New social norms—
As awareness of environmental issues and health concerns around some aspects of traditional Western diets have permeated society, social norms are changing. Rates of veganism have risen steadily, and many companies are disrupting established food markets or creating entirely new sub-industries. Consumer patterns in major industrialized economies are shifting toward local sources, organics and plant-based food.
Government incentives—
Some governments are providing incentives for sustainable food processes through tax breaks or subsidies. Farm to Fork (F2F), for example, is a part of a 10-year European Commission plan to create a healthy, fair and environmentally friendly EU food system.
6
What does this mean for you as an investor? Let’s look at three major areas of opportunity.Automation is changing as farmers seek to reduce input costs
We are rapidly advancing toward an “autonomous future” in which artificial intelligence, robotics and autonomous vehicles create greater productivity with fewer workers and more careful use of resources.
7
Agriculture will not be ignored in this process. Companies are using new technology, innovating with automation and connectivity, and utilizing precision agriculture where advanced sensors and powerful software can enhance productivity and reduce environmental impact.
For example, once an autonomous tractor is placed on the field, it enters autonomous operation and allow farmers to focus on other tasks.
8
It also allows more precise application of farming techniques, leading to lower input costs, aiming for higher margins and higher crop yields.
Smart agriculture, which involves the automation of commercial greenhouses with highly controlled environments, is one of the most exciting areas of growth in the food system. Market studies have shown a projected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.8% for the global smart agriculture market, which will potentially expand from its 14.44 billion size in 2021 to 30 billion in 2028.
9
Sustainable packaging market: Food packaging is changing as consumers demand sustainability
The global sustainable packaging market, a market in which packaging can be reused, recycled or composted, putting less stress on the environment, is projected to reach $470 billion by 2027, up from an estimated $305 billion in 2020.
10
It promises a shift away from throw-away plastics and a movement toward materials such as corrugated cardboard, packing paper, glassine, reusable plastic tubs and biodegradable, plant-based packaging.
Companies are innovating because consumers are demanding sustainability. About two-thirds of consumers say they consider it important that the products they buy come in sustainable packaging. The same percentage consider themselves environmentally aware.
11
Food producers and bioscience are changing what we eat
The U.S. market for organic and naturally healthy foods is estimated to nearly double, to $85 billion by 2027, up from about $52 billion in 2020.
12
In addition, new biotechnologies and fermentation tools that help preserve food during transport to market are likely to gain popularity as firms are pressured to reduce food waste. Some studies show that the market for improving food production and limiting food waste, via processes such as food contaminants and soil analysis, could grow from $30 billion in 2020 to $52 billion by 2030.
13
In addition, new nutrition options are gaining market share as consumers increasingly accept alternative proteins instead of meat and fish, such as:
Plant-based proteins— including soy, tempeh, seiten, black beans and “biomimickry” foods that try to replicate the look, feel and/or taste of animal proteins
Microbial proteins— single-cell proteins that consist of algae, fungi or bacteria
Cultivated meat— meat grown by cultivating animal cells in a laboratory
We expect the consumption of alternatives to increase over the next decade and a half, rising to 97 million metric tons by 2035.
14
Regulation continues to support the market for these innovative food options. For example, on November 26, 2022, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the first time cleared “cultured meat” for human consumption.
15
As of 2022, 100 companies were involved in the supply chain of cultured meat; by 2040, a projected 60% of meat will be created from cells grown within bioreactors.
16
We can help
Public and private companies are both looking to address the myriad challenges the food ecosystem faces. For investors, there seem to be many evolving opportunities across the entire food system value chain.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Winter Heating: unexpected economic resilience in the US and Europe; Large language model battles heat up
A warm Northern Hemisphere winter has coincided with a flurry of positive economic surprises in the US, Europe and Japan. The US list of positives includes retail sales, manufacturing output, the highest NAHB housing market index in 5 months, resilient residential construction employment, a rebound in the PMI services index, jobless claims back at low levels, a surge in the household survey of employment growth, a miniscule high yield default rate, stable capital spending projections and a 70% decline in the number of companies citing labor shortages. Also: GDP tracking models are back in positive territory everywhere in the developed world except the UK. Combine this with Europe surviving the winter with a high level of gas inventories and China’s re-opening, and the world growth outlook appears less troubling than it did last fall.The problem: policy rates are not normalized yet.
Despite the fastest Fed tightening cycle on record, real US 3-month and 10-year yields are still negative when based on trailing inflation measures. Consumer and producer price increases are falling as we expected they would but it’s too soon for the Fed to pause here. It also seems unlikely that the Fed or ECB will be able to cut rates later this year, unless they overshoot first. Will economic resilience prompt the Fed to tighten even more than markets expect? I think it would take more than a couple of months of positive surprises for the Fed to hike by 50 bps. We still see weakness ahead in our preferred leading indicator (new orders vs inventories) and deflation in the housing pipeline.
Bottom line
: 2-3 more Fed hikes ahead, and a mild US recession whose likelihood and possible severity may be shrinking.The US equity market rally this year is partially built on appreciation of low-quality and high short-interest stocks, a $6 trillion rebound in the global money supply, and the view that Fed hikes will not do much damage to the economy or earnings. With this backdrop and a deteriorating earnings outlook
1
,
I would not chase the equity market rally here
. It’s positive that the global economy is not imploding as some suggested it might. But I think there are still shoes to drop once lagged effect of higher US interest rates kick in.Large language model battles heat up
I was at our annual conference in Miami two weeks ago listening to Sam Altman from OpenAI talk about ChatGPT on the same day that Google rolled out Bard, its own large language model (LLM). The perception of a botched rollout roiled Google’s stock, resulting in its largest week of underperformance vs Microsoft in a decade and one of the largest since its 2004 IPO. There’s some irony here since Google’s Flan-PaLM model just passed the highly challenging US medical licensing exam, the first LLM to reportedly do so.Some big picture thoughts on LLM:
Artificial intelligence is attracting a lot of VC money and mind-share among computer scientists, as shown below. I’ve been critical of unprofitable innovation over the last two years (metaverse, hydrogen, buy-now-pay-later fintech, crypto, etc). But I feel differently about LLM; without getting into details of pre-IPO valuations for specific companies, I think LLM will result in much greater productivity benefits and disruption
LLM are essentially “conventional wisdom” machines; they don’t know anything other than what has already been documented in the annals of digitized human experience, which is how they are trained
BUT:
there are billions of dollars in market cap and millions of employees in industries which traffic in the packaging and conveyance of conventional wisdom every day
. In a 2022 survey of natural language processing researchers, 73% believed that “labor automation from artificial intelligence could plausibly lead to revolutionary societal change in this century, on at least the scale of the Industrial Revolution”
2
But before we get too carried away, let’s acknowledge the shortcomings of LLM as they exist right now…Hallucinations, bears in space and porcelain: LLM still make a lot of mistakes despite all the training
ChatGPT reportedly has a 147 IQ (99.9
th
percentile)
3
, but LLM need to get better since they routinely make mistakes called “hallucinations”.
They recommend books that don’t exist; they misunderstand what year it is; they incorrectly state that Croatia left the EU; they fabricate numbers in earnings reports; they create fake but plausible bibliographies for fabricated medical research; they write essays on the benefits of adding wood chips to breakfast cereal and on the benefits of adding crushed bits of porcelain to breast milk. The list of such examples is endless
4
, leading some AI researchers to describe LLM as “stochastic parrots”
Galactica, another LLM roll-out failure
: Meta’s LLM Galactica was yanked last November after just three days when its science-oriented model was criticized as “statistical nonsense at scale” and “dangerous”
5
. Galactica was designed for researchers to summarize academic papers, solve math problems, write code, annotate molecules, etc. But it was unable to distinguish truth from falsehood, and among other things, Galactica produced articles about the history of bears in space.
Gary Marcus
, emeritus professor of neural networks at NYU and founder of a machine learning company, described Galactica as “pitch perfect and utterly bogus imitations of science and math, presented as the real thing”
6
Stack Overflow
, a question-and-answer site many programmers use, imposed a temporary ban on ChatGPT-generated submissions: “Overall, because the average rate of getting correct answers from ChatGPT is too low, the posting of answers created by ChatGPT is substantially harmful to the site and to users who are asking or looking for correct answers”
7
New products will be needed to identify nonsense LLM output.
Researchers trained an LLM to write fake medical abstracts based on articles in
JAMA
,
the
New England Journal of Medicine
,
BMJ
,
Lancet
and
Nature Medicine
. An AI-output checker was only able to identify 2/3 of the fakes, and human reviewers weren’t able to do much better; humans also mistakenly described 15% of the real ones as being fake
8
The new Bing chatbot has already been “
jailbroken
” to provide advice on how to rob a bank, burglarize a house and hot-wire a car (by Jensen Harris, ex-Microsoft / currently at Textio)
The ability for AI to replace humans is sometimes exaggerated.
In 2016, a preeminent deep learning expert predicted the end of the radiology profession, advocating that hospitals stop training them since within 5 years, deep learning would be better
9
. The consensus today: machine learning for radiology is harder than it looks
10
, and AI is best used complementing humans instead
LLM have begun to train themselves to get better
. Google designed an LLM that comes up with questions, filters answers for high-quality output and fine-tunes itself. This led to improved performance on various language tasks (from 74% to 82% on one benchmark, and from 78% to 83% on another)
11
.
Human interaction
is also a part of the improvement process; the “.5” in Chat-GPT 3.5 refers to the incorporation of human feedback
12
that was consequential enough to give it another digit
Even with all the hallucinations, LLM are making progress on certain well-specified tasks
. LLM have potential to disrupt certain industries, and increase the productivity of others.
Despite a Chat-GPT ban at Stack Overflow,
LLM coding assistance is being rapidly embraced by developers.
GitHub’s Copilot tool which is powered by OpenAI added 400k users in its first month, and now has over 1 million users who use it for ~40% of the code in their projects
13
. Tabnine, another AI-powered coding assistant, also reports 1 million users who use it for 30% of their code. Microsoft has an advantage here through its partnership with OpenAI and its ownership of GitHub
LLMs have outperformed sell-side analysts when
picking stocks
(not shocking)
14
, and show promise regarding long-short
trading strategies
based on synthesis of CFO conference call transcripts
15
. They also improve
audit
quality
using frequency of restatements as a proxy, and do so with fewer people
16
. Projects like GatorTron at the University of Florida use LLM to extract insights from massive amounts of clinical data with the goal of furthering
medical research
Other possible uses include marketing/sales, operations, engineering, robotics, fraud identification and law. Examples:
LLM can be used to predict breaches of fiduciary obligations and associated legal standards
. A database of court opinions on breach of fiduciary duty has never been online for LLM to train on
17
. Even so, GPT-3.5 was able to predict 78% of the time whether there was a positive or negative judgment, compared to 73% for GPT-3.0 and 27% for OpenAI’s 2020 LLM. LLM using GPT-3.5 achieved 50% on the Multistate Bar Exam (vs a 25% baseline guessing rate), and passed Evidence and Torts
18
. ChatGPT also demonstrated good drafting skills for demand letters, pleadings and summary judgments, and even drafted questions for cross-examination. LLM are not replacements for lawyers, but can augment their productivity particularly when legal databases like Westlaw and Lexis are used for training them
Another example: GPT-3.5 as corporate lobbyist aide
. An AI model was fed a list of legislation, estimated which bills were relevant to different companies and drafted letters to bill sponsors arguing for relevant changes to it
19
. The model had an 80% chance of identifying whether a bill was relevant to each company
Microsoft and NVIDIA have released
Megatron
, the largest LLM to date with 530 billion parameters and which aims to let businesses create their own AI applicationsIs there an upper limit regarding online information to train these models?
AI researchers estimate that the stock of high-quality language data is between 4.6 trillion and 17 trillion words, which is less than one order of magnitude larger than the largest datasets used today. They believe that LLM will exhaust high-quality data between 2023 and 2027, while the stock of low-quality data and images will last well beyond that.
Source: “
Will we run out of data? An analysis of the limits of scaling datasets in Machine Learning
”, Sevilla (University of Aberdeen) et al, October 2022What will happen to the profitability of the search business?
Microsoft’s CEO stated that “the gross margin of search is going to drop forever”, and Sam Altman at OpenAI has referred to the existence of “lethargic search monopolies” that are at risk
Google knows a lot about machine learning and AI, and I anticipate a robust response from them at some point soon regarding its capabilities after the Bard rollout.
But future search economics do look more challenging
. Google’s operating margins (including Youtube) have averaged ~24% since 2018. Any LLM initiative on Google’s part would sit on top of its existing cost structure
Estimates of ChatGPT costs vary widely from 0.4 - 4.5 cents per query, a function of the number of words generated per query, model size
20
and costs of computing
21
. Let’s assume 2 cents per ChatGPT query as a rough midpoint. This compares to 0.2 - 0.3 cents of infrastructure costs per standard Google search query. Using ChatGPT costs as a starting point, every 10% increase in Google queries powered by AI would reduce Google’s operating margin by 1.5%-1.7%, according to the Morgan Stanley reports cited below. For these reasons, it’s worth wondering if Microsoft and Google will offer higher-cost LLM-enhanced search engine products to all users, or just to users with higher expected ad revenue potential
However
: Google announced that Bard will rely on a “lightweight” version of LaMDA instead of the full version or its larger PaLM model. As a result, ChatGPT’s cost per query may substantially overstate the incremental costs Google would incur from its own LLM initiatives
More broadly, LLM costs are lower when “sparse” models are used
. If you submit a request to GPT-3, all 175 billion of its parameters are used to generate a response. Sparse models narrow the field of knowledge required to answer a question, and can be larger
and
less computationally demanding. GLaM, a sparse expert model developed by Google, is 7x larger than GPT-3, requires two-thirds less energy to train, requires half as much computing effort and outperforms GPT-3 on a wide range of natural language tasks
22
Google’s share of search traffic has averaged 92% over the last year. As shown below,
Google has so far suffered an immaterial decline in that share since ChatGPT was launched
. These relative shares also imply that Google’s LLM could get smarter a lot faster than ChatGPT due to more usageWhat is the future of LLM capabilities?
Watch the “Big Bench”
There’s a project underway called “Big Bench” with contributions from Google, OpenAI and over 100 other AI firms. Big Bench crowd-sourced 204 tasks from over 400 researchers with the goal of assessing how LLM perform vs humans. From the authors: “Task topics are diverse, drawing problems from linguistics, childhood development, math, common-sense reasoning, biology, physics, social bias, software development, and beyond. BIG Bench focuses on tasks believed to be beyond the capabilities of current language models”. The tasks are interesting, and I list indicative ones below
23
.
The Big Bench team published their first results last summer and as shown below,
there’s a way to go before LLM catch up to humans on higher degree-of-difficulty tasks
. Increasing LLM parameter sizes help, but these models still perform poorly in an absolute sense. Model performance also improves with the number of examples that LLM are given at the time of inference, which is what the subscripts in the charts refer to (1-shot vs 3-shot); but again, absolute LLM performance scores are still low. It will be interesting to see how the latest LLM perform against Big Bench given how quickly they’re improving.
By the way: note how performance of OpenAI and Google LLM were similar when calibrated at the same parameter scale in the first chart.
The LLM battles are just beginning
. Next steps: LLM integration into products like Office 365 and Google Docs/Sheets; longer context windows for entering more data at time of inference; LLMs capable of digesting data matrices and charts and not just text; and shorter latency periods for bulk users.Indicative Big Bench challenges:
Ask models to determine whether a given text is intended to be a joke (with dark humor) or not
Give an English language description of Python code
Solve logic grid puzzles and identify logical fallacies
Classify CIFAR10 images encoded in various ways
Find a move in the chess position resulting in checkmate
Ask a model to guess popular movies from their plot descriptions written in emojis
Answer questions in Spanish about cryobiology
GRE exam reading comprehension
A set of shapes is given in simple language; determine the number of intersection points between shapes
Given short crime stories, identify the perpetrator and explain the reasoning
Present models with a proverb in English and ask it to choose a proverb in Russian that is closest in meaning
Ask one instance of a model to teach another instance, and then evaluate the quality
Identify which ethical choice best aligns with human judgement
Determine which of two sentences is sarcastic

MR. MICHAEL CEMBALEST: Welcome to the February 2023 Eye on the Market podcast. This one is called Winter Heating. Most of what we’re going to be talking about are the battles between the new large language models, which you’re reading about everywhere, a quick few comments on the markets and the Fed. One of the warmest northern hemisphere winters in decades has coincided with a flurry of positive economic surprises in the U.S., Europe, and Japan. The U.S. list of positive surprises is a long line, from employment, retail sales, manufacturing, jobless claims, a miniscule high-yield default rate, capital spending projections are stable, et cetera, so definitely a surprise in terms of how strong the U.S. economy is in January and February.
The problem is that policy rates aren’t normalized yet, and looks like we may peak closer to 5 and a quarter to 550 on the funds rate before the Fed pauses. So we still see some weakness ahead in our preferred leading indicator, which is looking at new orders versus inventories. And the bottom line is it looks like we’ve got two to three more Fed hikes ahead and a mild recession whose likelihood and possible severity is probably shrinking.
What makes us not really want to chase the equity market rally here is that the rally so far this year has been based, at least in part, on appreciation of some low-quality and high-short-interest stocks, a huge explosion in the money supply both in Asia, and the view that the Fed hikes aren’t going to do that much damage to the economy, which I think is still flowing through.
We did not have the view there was going to be a severe recession this year; we thought it would be a mild one. And we still think that’s the case. And as we’re looking at leading indicators for earnings, it does look like there is some downside for both earnings and margins in the month ahead, but nothing too catastrophic.
The centerpiece of today’s podcast and our Eye on the Market this week is on these large language models, which have been impossible to ignore over the last couple months. I was at our annual client investment conference in Miami a couple weeks ago was listening to Sam Altman from OpenAI talk about ChatGPT. And it was on the same day that Google had rolled out Bard, its own large language model, where there was a perception of a botched rollout by Google.
And it resulted in one of the largest weeks of underperformance of Google versus Microsoft in a decade and one of the largest since Google’s IPO in 2004, which was ironic because just last month, one of Google’s large language models passed the U.S. medical licensing exam for the first time. It was reportedly the first one of these models to be able to do that.
So I want to give you some big picture thoughts on all of this large language model stuff. Artificial intelligence is attracting a ton of VC money and mindshare among computer science Ph.Ds. I’ve been very critical of unprofitable innovation over the last couple of years, whether it was the metaverse or hydrogen or these buy now, pay later companies or crypto or anything. But I feel differently about this stuff without getting into the details of pre-IPO evaluations for specific companies. I think these models are going to result in greater productivity benefits and disruption than those other things, although the bar is admittedly low when you’re talking about things like metaverse and crypto.
Large language models are essentially conventional wisdom machines. They don’t know anything other than what has already been documented in digitized human experience. They are not artificial intelligence the way that you conceive of it in terms of it coming up with something new that hasn’t been thought of yet.
That said, there’s billions and billions of dollars of market cap in companies that traffic in the packaging and conveyance of conventional wisdom all the time. And so what is interesting is that artificial intelligence in these large language models aren’t likely to kind of break any new ground intellectually, but they have the potential to displace a lot of the conventional thinking and conventional wisdom companies that exist right now.
So before we get too carried away, I want to be clear about a few things. These models make tons of mistakes, tons of them. And some of them are kind of hysterical. They recommend books that don’t exist, they don’t know what year it is, they believe certain countries have left the EU and it hasn’t happened, they make up numbers in earnings reports, they write essays on the benefits of adding woodchips to your breakfast cereal. The list is endless, and some AI people describe these models as sarcastic parrots because all they’re just doing is repeating things that they see, and sometimes not correctly.
And remember, it was just last November when Facebook/Meta rolled out Galactica, which was a large language model designed to help researchers summarize academic papers and solve math problems and write code. It was unable to distinguish truth from falsehood. It produced articles about the history of bears in space and got yanked after three days of intense criticism from the scientific community.
As another sign of how far there is to go here, Stack Overflow, which some of you may have heard of, is a question-and-answer site that a lot of developers and programmers use, I’ve even used it to help me with some Visual Basic code, they put a ban on ChatGPT submissions at that website because the rate of getting correct answers from it wasn’t good enough.
And so we’re still in a world where there’s a lot of errors that come out of this stuff, and you can make it, you can make these models produce garbage. Some researchers at Northwestern trained a model to write fake medical research abstracts, which both other models and humans couldn’t figure out were fake.
There’s also a lot of hype in this space. One of the grandfathers of machine learning in 2016 advised hospitals to stop training radiologists because we wouldn’t need them anymore since deep learning would be better. And here we are a few years later, and it turns out machine learning for radiology is a lot harder than it looks. And artificial intelligence in that kind of thing is best used when complementing doctors instead of replacing them. All of these errors and bizarre things that large language models do are referred to as hallucinations, and you can see why.
Now with that, these models are making progress on a lot of well-specified tasks. And despite what Stack Overflow to ChatGPT, there are a couple of new companies that are being rapidly embraced by developers. GitHub has something called a copilot tool, added 400,000 users in its first month, now has over a million users who use it to help them with 40% of their code. Tabnine is another artificial intelligence-powered coding assistant backed by a lot of the who’s who in Silicon Valley, also have a million users. And Microsoft has an advantage here, ‘cause it’s got a partnership with both OpenAI and it owns GitHub.
And there have been just in the last few months some interesting practitioner and academic analyses of what you can do with these models. They outperform sell-side analysts when picking stocks. They show promise in putting together short-term, long-term, long/short trading strategies based on synthesizing comments from CFOs in conference call transcripts. They are already improving audit quality at the big accounting firms if you use the frequency of audit restatements as a proxy for that. The University of Florida created something called GatorTron to extract insights from terabytes and terabytes of clinical data to help them with medical research.
And in law firms, this is looking interesting. These models have correctly gone through court cases and predicted with the judgements were going to be. They have passed bar exams. They have begun to be used to draft contracts and conduct legal research, et cetera, et cetera. And Microsoft just released MegaTron, which is the largest one of these things to date. So there is evidence that if you narrow down the scope of what you’re asking these models to do, that they can be more productive and do a much better job.
One of the big questions that came out of this, as I mentioned earlier, Google’s stock got pummeled after this rollout. What’s going to happen to the profitability of the search business? Microsoft’s CEO says the gross margins of these, of search is going to drop forever, and Sam Altman is referred to lethargic search monopolies. We know who he’s talking about when he says things like that.
We’ll see. I mean Google knows a lot about machine learning and artificial intelligence. They were the ones that designed some of these initial transformer programs. There’s a lot of machine learning that already is going on within Google Search. And I anticipate a pretty robust response from them soon regarding their capabilities after what happened.
That said, the search economics do look more challenging. Google’s operating margins are about 24%. And that includes YouTube, so obviously without that, they’re higher. But anything that they offer with respect to large language models being integrated into the regular search offering would sit on top of their existing cost structure.
Now ChatGPT’s cost structure is pretty high because they’re not completely vertically integrated, and depending upon the number of words generated per query, the model size, and their computing costs, it can get very expensive for them. And some of the estimates we’ve seen is anywhere from five to ten times more expensive per query compared to the standard Google search query.
But I think it’s important to remember, first, Google has announced that when and if they incorporate large language models into the search engine, it would be a lightweight version instead of its heavy-duty version. So I think the ChatGPT cost estimates probably overstate the impact on Google’s operating margins.
Also, there are things called sparse models. Right now if you use ChatGPT 3, all 175 billion parameters are used to generate a response, and sparse models are built narrowing the field of knowledge that you need to answer a question, and they require a lot less training energy, a lot less computing energy, and actually can work faster.
I know it’s tempting to kind of look at the pace of innovation and see a big threat to Google here on the search side. So far, the ChatGPT/Bing combination has taken like .3% market share on search traffic from Google, whose base market share is above 92%. So I just think it’s important to look at the numbers to keep these things in context.
What’s the future of these things, these large language models? One of the more interesting projects that’s underway is, despite all the hyperbole of what these things can and can’t do, there is about 400 researchers from Google, OpenAI, and 100 other firms, and they’ve put together something called the BIG-bench, which refers to the big benchmark. And they’ve all created about 200 tasks for large language models to solve, and I list a few of them in the Eye in the Markets.
Some of them are interesting. They ask the models to guess what movie they’re referring to when they describe the plot just written in emojis. They have a take-the-GRE exam reading comprehension section where sometimes the right answer is more than one. They read short stories about crime and have to identify who the perpetrator was and the reasoning behind it. They have to see whether they can identify sarcasm or dark humor. You get the point. These are common-sense reasoning capabilities that are often beyond what the current models can do.
And they released the results last summer, and there’s a long way to go. So the aggregate score that Google and OpenAI were getting at the time was about a 15 out of 100, where the average human was a 45, and the best humans were 70 to 80. So these models have a long way to go in understanding things and being able to put things in proper context. The larger the models get presumably, they’ll be able to get better at doing this.
But these large language models, the battles are just beginning. A lot of times their capabilities are overstated. But it will be interesting to watch the narrow, more well-defined tasks that they get asked to do, ‘cause that’s really where the big productivity benefits are going to come from. And my feeling is they’ll probably end up boosting productivity of companies rather than putting legions of people out of work. But we will see. Anyway, take a look at this month’s Eye on the Market, and we get into all of these details and more. Good talking to you, and we’ll see you next time, bye.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.When working with philanthropists on humanitarian relief, we often encourage them to think about the traditional trio of ‘relief, recovery and rebuild’.Philanthropists are often in a position to be nimble and reactive, putting them in a unique position to respond to crises quickly.It’s important to acknowledge when you are not the expert, and to focus on supporting organisations that you have confidence in, to provide support where it is needed most.Olivia Jenkins, Head of The Philanthropy Centre, Europe and the Middle East for J.P. Morgan Private Bank

David Miliband, President and CEO of the International Rescue Committee (IRC)
Philanthropists are often in a position to be nimble and reactive, putting them in a unique position to respond to crises quickly. But how can they help when the duration of a crisis is unknown and the impact is unrelenting?
In this article, Olivia Jenkins, Head of The Philanthropy Centre, Europe and the Middle East for J.P. Morgan Private Bank, shares advice she received from Hang Ho, Head of Global Philanthropy International for the J.P. Morgan Chase Foundation, and David Miliband, President and CEO of the International Rescue Committee (IRC), for philanthropists to consider one year on from the outbreak of the war in Ukraine.
Their lessons and thoughts are relevant when thinking through continued support for Ukraine, but also in reaction to future and current disasters, such as the devastating earthquakes in Türkiye and Syria earlier this month.Collaboration and communication
When working in often dangerous situations, philanthropy needs to be collaborative. Hang reminds us that it’s important to acknowledge when you are not the expert, and to focus on supporting trusted organisations to provide support where it is needed most. Encouraging open dialogue with your partners in relief efforts is vital to allow you to identify your role both in an initial response, and on an ongoing basis.
David echoed much of this, highlighting that the IRC views partnership as based on a marriage of expertise – expertise that is both different and complementary to its own. As an organisation they seek to have local credibility and legitimacy, allowing them to work with others to scale in response to changing needs. This has been particularly relevant to their work in Eastern Ukraine, where fewer NGOs have a presence and there is continuing pressing need.
The message from both was clear – build a team, either internally or with partners, that you know and trust, allowing you to have the confidence in them to respond in the most impactful way to a crisis.
Consider cash as a tool and remain flexible
David shared that the IRC often use cash as a distribution method; considering it to be empowering, efficient and effective. Cash allows families to respond to their own changing requirements in a disaster and working with existing banking systems – such as in Ukraine – can be the fastest way to reach the most vulnerable.
The J.P. Morgan Chase Foundation offers flexible funding when it comes to relief efforts, operating on an unrestricted basis as they believe that in quickly changing situations their partners on the ground know how to provide support best. This is a sentiment we often encourage clients we work with in The Philanthropy Centre to consider.
Who are we trying to reach?
When working in conflict situations, David reminded us that women and girls bear extra risks, and so providing holistic care such as psychosocial support forms part of their considerations. The majority of Ukrainian refugees in Poland are women and children, many of whom are in need of social and medical care in addition to housing and childcare to enable them to enter employment. The J.P. Morgan Chase Foundation therefore worked with trusted partners to develop considered programmes that worked alongside schools and social partners to deliver employment programmes that also provide wrap around support – including access to childcare. Starting from a stance of ‘who are we trying to reach?’ allows thoughtful grantmaking.
Pull all levers at your disposal
Hang and her team at the J.P. Morgan Chase Foundation have had an evolving response to the crisis in Ukraine. What started as an initial philanthropic commitment to existing and trusted partners to deliver relief developed into a collaboration with The Chamber of Commerce of the Polish Hotel Industry via our real estate team to offer shelter and assistance to refugees. This has now led to a work and training programme including language and schooling support in the J.P. Morgan Warsaw office. By working with internal and external partners, Hang and her team were able to identify how they could best help those impacted by the war.
We encourage philanthropists to similarly explore all avenues for impact available to them; remaining flexible and responsive to need, and considering different tools for support as situations develop.
Philanthropic capital as risk capital
We spoke to David less than 36 hours after the earthquakes in Türkiye and Syria, in the middle of the IRC’s initial response. He spoke of the desperate need for blankets, tents and food as the freezing temperatures impacted the survivors and the rescue efforts. By using their emergency response fund, much of which is funded through private philanthropy, the IRC was able to respond immediately to the crisis, assessing what the need is and the role it could play in helping impacted communities. This current example highlights the important role philanthropy can play in providing quick and flexible assistance.Looking to the future – consider the sustainability of interventions
Finally, David encourages philanthropists to look to the future, considering both conflict and climate as among the key drivers for future crises. Private philanthropy is an important part of the sector’s ability to be able to respond instantly to need and also plays a role in ensuring sustainable rather than episodic recovery.
When working in Poland, Hang and her team collaborated with partners with strong links in the community and ability to work collaboratively with key actors across sectors to ensure sustainable programme design that acknowledges the unique challenges that Ukrainian refugees face, taking lessons learnt from their previous responses.
We are here to help

Our Top Market Takeaways for February 24, 2023.
Market update
What’s so good about 5%
The big story in markets the last few weeks is that investors think policy rates in the United States will stay higher for longer.
After a string of strong economic data to start the year, the market thinks short rates will be almost 5.4% by the end of the year, up from 4.5% in January.
As a result, this week, for the first time in over 15 years, one-year Treasury bills yield over 5%.Earning 5% to lend money to the U.S. government seems tough to beat. But as we
recently argued
, investors should be mindful of what they might be missing when they keep too much capital in T-bills.
Despite the uncertainties, many different markets, assets and securities have outperformed the 0.59% return that cash has generated so far. Here are just a few examples:

Buying the dip in municipal bonds
Last week, we asked when the municipal bond market might get to a point where it gets attractive to U.S. taxpayers again. This week, we explain why we think now is the time to consider buying the dip in municipal bonds.
The strong start to the year for fixed income was too good to be true. Investment grade municipal bonds have pared most of their close to 3% rally to start the year after hotter than anticipated inflation and employment data forced investors to reassess the path of Federal Reserve policy. Now that investors are expecting policy rates to go higher and stay there longer, investment grade and high yield municipal bond indices have dropped by 2.3% and 3.4%, respectively.
Investors are starting to lose some faith. Prior to February 9, municipal bond funds saw 26 consecutive days of inflows. Since that time, they have experienced outflows on six out of the last eight days. While a 3% sell-off may not seem like much to equity investors, this is a pretty material unravelling in the municipal bond space.
The good news is that we think this sell-off is giving U.S. taxpayers a good opportunity to pick up some yield, especially in shorter-term bonds. In January, yields on short-term municipal bonds were so low that they failed to beat similar T-bills on an after-tax basis. But now, after the sell-off, there are many parts of the market that can.
In fact, the municipal SIFMA Index, which measures the yields on 7-day tax-exempt securities, has surged to 3.4%, and nearly hit 4% just last week. Almost incredibly, this is comparable to the yield on the 20-year Municipal Bond Index. Indeed, many parts of the municipal yield curve are inverted. This is historically rare, and is another indicator of the potential value in short-term municipal bonds.As the Fed reaches the end of its rate hiking cycle and inflation continues its bumpy decline, we expect longer-duration core bonds to outperform short-term ones (either municipal, federal or corporate). But short-term municipal bonds may look attractive for capital that is earmarked for liquidity and yield in the near term.

Cross Asset Strategy
February was an eventful month for markets. The Fed slowed the pace of hiking to 25bps at the start of the month, signaling an exit from the “crisis tightening model”, however it was followed by a sharp repricing of terminal rates from 4.8% to 5.5% on stronger-than-expected economic data. U.S. Treasury yields surged across the curve with the 2-year jumping +59bps and 10-year up +43bps during the month (both the largest increases since September), sending equities lower and the dollar higher. The pressure extended into this week and the S&P 500 finished February below the 4,000 mark.
Taking into account the latest development, we now expect the Fed to hike to a terminal rate of 5.0% - 5.25%, and finishing the year at 4.50% - 4.75% with cuts coming in Q4 2023. If economic data continues to surprise to the upside, the probability of cuts shifting to Q1 2024 could grow higher. We still expect tight conditions to cause a recession within the year, which could eventually send long-end yields lower (we think the 10-year will likely end the year around 2.85%). At the current level, core fixed income remains high conviction as it provides attractive yields and protection during downturns.
In China, equities went into consolidation over the past weeks after a sharp rebound following reopening. This week, all eyes are on the annual Two Sessions, and the expectation that more guidance on policy direction may come. Read on for a deep dive on what to expect.
Strategy Question: Will China’s “Two Sessions” be a turning point?
China’s National Party Congress (NPC) and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC and also known as the Two Sessions) kick off this weekend and will likely last until March 20. Over the course of these meetings the government will set major economic targets and lay out key priorities and reform initiatives.
Some of the key questions likely to be addressed include: What will be the GDP growth target? Will the government jump-start market-oriented reforms? Will speeches address the concerns of foreign businesses? And importantly, how will the government look to revive consumer confidence? In today’s note we assess how China’s recovery is progressing, while reiterating our views on the economy and markets. We’ll also preview what to expect at the Two Sessions and follow up in coming weeks with key takeaways.
After a rapid normalization catalyzed by re-opening policies, we expect China’s economy to recover more gradually in the coming months. While there is pent up demand, as well as excess savings, there is also considerable slack in the labor market (see chart below), as well as the overall economy. Sectors with secular tailwinds, for example consumer services and industrial sectors, will likely recover faster than others, such as the property sector. But from a broader point of view, it will likely take a few quarters for the economy to return to a higher overall utilization rate and kick off a virtuous cycle of economic growth. Policies will likely turn more supportive under the new economic leadership. We expect 2023 GDP growth to average 4.0%, and improve further to 4.9% in 2024. We are below consensus largely because we see a significant drag from weaker exports, as well as a still sluggish housing recovery. The three key factors – exports, consumption, and property – will likely be the key to China’s recovery. If global demand is stronger than we expect, or property sector confidence rebounds more quickly, then there is upside to our forecasts. On the other hand, if consumption underperforms then it will be a challenge for the economy to reach government targets. The tone set at the Two Sessions and the extent private sector confidence can be restored will be the factors to watch.On the consumption front, high frequency indicators point to a swift rebound in consumer sentiment. Services consumption, like restaurants and domestic tourism, have all bounced off the lows. We expect the recovery in services consumption to continue in the coming months. In contrast with seemingly strong tendencies towards spending on services, goods spending growth looks more moderate. Auto sales, for example, were down 30% y/y in January, and were only recovering slowly in February, partly due to the phase-out of buyer subsidies. We expect the overall consumption recovery will slow to a more moderate pace of growth in line with income growth in 2023. We expect headline retail sales to grow 7% in 2023, up from 1% in 2022 but slower than the 9% pre-pandemic due to the drag from housing-related big ticket items.
The restricted mobility brought on by the pandemic has meant that consumers have RMB15trn more in savings than pre-pandemic. Estimates of how much of this is “excess savings” will be imprecise, but our guess is that it’s around RMB4-5trn. While some will be drawn down this year and spent on holidays, we think a lot will only be spent over time. This is partly because a lot of the savings arise from deferred home purchases, which is not easily redirected, at least in the near term. More importantly, in China, consumer sentiment is cyclical, just like business sentiment. After several years of significant upheavals in the economy, such as the trade war, Covid restrictions, and the property market downturn, households are likely going to be more focused on job security, and income, in the near term. As the economic recovery makes further headway, and income prospects improve, households will likely feel comfortable to gradually draw down the rest of their excess savings in the coming quarters.In regards to the corporate sector, anecdotal evidence suggests that production normalization has been swift after the holidays. That said, in the backdrop, global demand has been slowing at a rapid pace (see below chart). For example, export figures from China and other East Asian economies, which tend to act as bellwethers for global demand, have shown a very sharp decline. Korean exports were down 7.5% y/y, in February following a 16.6% decline in January. Similarly, indicators of Chinese exports all showed weakness to start the year. The China Containerized Freight Index, which measures the average shipping price of containers from China’s 10 major ports to other parts of the world, declined by 13.9% from end-December to mid-February, while the Freightos Baltic Index, a measure of international freight rates, dropped by 11.3% over the same period. In addition to an expected global downturn, many global consumers are continuing the shift from goods and towards services spending, which is exacerbating the Asia export slowdown.
The late cycle global downturn will likely constrain capex plans in the near term. Meanwhile, property developers are still paying down their debt, and are likely still a few quarters away from fresh Capex activity. In the property sector, confidence is key. Despite looser measures over recent months, sales and activity haven’t bounced back. This stems from key concerns around price expectations and developers’ ability to deliver properties. With lingering concerns about unfinished properties, and prices that remain sky high in many cities, would-be purchasers are largely staying on the sidelines. It’s unclear whether “animal spirits” will return to the sector, but our sense is that the overhang of still-high prices, excess inventory, and shaky developers will take some time to normalize and continue to be a drag on overall economic activity.As the Two Sessions unfold a lot of focus will be on the new economic leadership. Transition does not occur in a day, but rather spans the whole year, as the incoming ministers and governors get acquainted with their tasks at hand, and develop new policy initiatives. The Two Sessions is the beginning, rather than the end, of the personnel transition. In the near term, the key focus will be the government work report, annual budget, as well as press conferences. We think this year’s policy focus will likely be on supporting the post-pandemic growth recovery, and the language around the GDP target will send an important signal. A positive message will likely be welcomed, although we are not expecting an outsized stimulus. On the fiscal side, while the pandemic has been quite costly from a fiscal perspective, we expect the government to maintain most of the fiscal support, such as local government bond quotas, and support for small and medium-sized businesses. Adding the two main fiscal books together, this may translate into an overall fiscal deficit of around 6-7% of GDP, (similar to 2022), with spending focused more on infrastructure necessary for the green transition and industrial upgrading. On the monetary policy side, the PBoC will likely look through some post-pandemic price increases and even lean accommodative by encouraging banks to do more business lending. The new PBoC governor will also be announced alongside the cabinet. In recent years, policy coordination has become a big focus and we may see some institutional change to improve this.
In addition, foreign investors will likely be particularly interested in how the new economic leadership approaches sector regulations, after some big policy-induced adjustments over the last few years – first with the internet, and then with the property sector. While major adjustments such as those are probably behind us, we expect to see signals of policy stability ahead. That said, the attention will turn to policies around economic restructuring, and particularly the interaction between the government and private sector. In recent years increased government involvement in the economy has driven productivity, and in some direct cases, return on investment lower. Speeches during the Two Sessions will give key insight into how the new economic leadership team plans to address stalled economic reforms and the broad operating environment.
Geopolitical tensions could continue to be a wild card, but the NPC could potentially set the tone on what to expect. Increasingly, investors are learning to accept that geopolitics is part of the new normal when seeking returns. While geopolitics are impossible to predict (and the market impact is even harder to predict), the one area where we could see a continued impact is on the global flow of capital. An easing of U.S. tensions and clear signs of economic re-opening drove sharp inflows at the start of the year, but as events unfolded in recent weeks there are signs that global capital has turned more cautious. If the U.S. measures move to restrict capital flows into China or worsening tensions turn investors more cautious, geopolitics could continue to play a role in global sentiment, and also have an impact on China’s recovery.
Investment implications
From an investment perspective, the RMB will likely be influenced by broad USD directions in the near term. We think the RMB will likely remain range bound against the dollar from here, despite screening relatively rich versus a basket of currencies due to balance of payment pressure. Given the uptick in both onshore and offshore bond yields, we also see some select opportunities in the fixed income space, with some FX overlay to boost returns.
On equities, we are positive on outbound consumption / brokers / oil / renewable energy, and cautious on property / banks / EVs / exports.
From the Two Sessions we expect more policy stimulus for green energy (positive for renewable companies); financial market reform will be re-emphasized and probably accelerated (positive for brokers); banks will be encouraged to promote lending, likely at the expense of higher bad debt / lower margin (negative for banks). Markets have currently priced in low expectation in policy support to the internet sector, so any surprises are likely on the upside. The oil sector may not be a focus in the NPC, but this sector remains under-allocated, with a decent dividend yield of 10%+. A faster-than-expected China economic recovery may provide upside to oil prices.Fundamentally we are cautious on export-related sectors given the uncertain outlook. On the other hand, consumption sectors, especially service sectors like restaurants and households, will likely continue to rebound. Nonetheless, most of the short-term positives are priced in regarding the consumption rebound, so we prefer to wait for a dip to add to this sector. The outbound tourism-related sector remains our preferred consumption proxy. The outlook for big ticket items like auto and housing remains challenging given the lack of consumer confidence, so excess savings will likely stay in the consumer’s bank account in the next few months. Although potentially nearing a bottom, property sales remain sluggish, hence we only suggest tactically buying selected high-quality privately owned developers with strong balance sheets, while staying cautious on distressed developers.
We are particularly cautious on the electric vehicle sector given the increasingly competitive industry landscape since Q4 2022 and the lack of funding sources from the capital market (or at much higher interest expense). A price war has already started and most of the smaller EV companies will face huge margin pressure, with the breakeven timetable prolonged (if they can survive this round). On the other hand, we are increasingly positive on the renewable sector as share prices have corrected meaningfully in the past few months, making their valuation attractive again, especially versus the broader market.
We expect China onshore to outperform offshore from here.
Traditionally onshore China shares outperform offshore China in a policy-driven market rally

, which is likely the case in 2023. Onshore equity investors currently remain relatively calm and do not have high allocation to the A-share markets.

If business and consumer confidence continue to recover over the next few months, we expect higher onshore participation as the IPO reform (i.e. New Registration System) and SOE reforms help to reshape China’s onshore equity market. Meanwhile, MSCI China inclusion provides longer term liquidity support.
Recent consolidation provides an appealing re-entry opportunity.
The post-Chinese New Year consolidation in February is largely within our expectation, given the 50%+ sharp rebound in MSCI China / Hang Seng Index since last October. We take this as an attractive re-entry opportunity. Our year-end outlook is unchanged at 23000-24500 / 75-80. We overweight China (both onshore and offshore) as the macro and earnings recovery story remain intact. China onshore is expected to outperform offshore shares given its higher leverage towards policy stimulus, and stronger resilience in the case of intensifying geopolitical tension. The recent consolidation in A-shares is an opportunity to add exposure. We are confident that the upcoming reporting season in March/April, together with more fund inflows, will likely lead the second stage of a China market rebound in Q2.1

Our Top Market Takeaways for March 3, 2023.
Market update
It’s getting warmer
…and the slew of strong data of late (from manufacturing to inflation, consumption and jobs) has been too hot for markets to handle.
Bond yields have gone on another tear higher—2-year Treasury yields breached 4.9% for the first time since 2007, and the 10-year is back above 4% for the first time in four months. February’s surge was the largest monthly jump since September. Bonds are back on the menu, and the latest moves give investors another chance to bite.
And while higher rates have prompted stocks’ weakness over the last three weeks, the S&P 500 is sitting at the same level (3,981) it was in May 2022, when the Federal reserve was expected to only hike to 3%. Stocks are holding up pretty well, considering 10-year Treasury yields have jolted over 100 basis points since then and markets are now pricing Fed policy rates to get to 5.5%.
Stocks outside the United States are holding up even better. Core Eurozone inflation hit another record yesterday, and the Stoxx Europe 600, which includes companies listed across the region, still finished the day in the green and is sitting at levels prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Chinese stocks are also catching another bid as reopening boosts growth. February’s PMI data (one of our favorite leading growth indicators) just smashed expectations across the board, with manufacturing activity expanding at its fastest pace in over a decade.
All that’s to say, U.S. large-cap stocks are holding up, but they may not be the only game in town. We continue to scour the market for pockets of opportunity that offer compelling valuations and growth. Within the United States, small- and mid-cap stocks might be hidden gems, and today we share why we think investors should consider building exposure.
Spotlight
Broadening horizons: Looking to SMID-cap stocks
You would never shop in only one aisle of the supermarket, would you? Unfortunately, many investors do just that when it comes to their portfolios—by, for example, sticking to their home country markets, or to just familiar large companies. Failing to broaden horizons or adapt to the changing tide could leave future returns on the table, especially in a shifting economic environment like this one.
We believe the opportunity is ripe today for smaller and medium-sized companies, for
three big reasons:
1. Believe it or not: Small- and mid-cap stocks have outperformed large-cap companies over the last 25 years.
We all tend to suffer from a bit of recency bias—we expect what happened in the past to repeat. Big tech galvanized large-cap stock returns over the last decade, earning a whopping ~160% price return since then. Yet, a look at returns over the last 25 years shows us that smaller companies have actually outgrown and outperformed larger firms.
All that’s to say, the large-cap outperformance over the last few years may be the exception, not the rule.2. It’s so bad, it’s good. We think valuations and earnings estimates have bottomed—cue entry point.
Over the last year, across all market capitalization ranges, estimates for corporate profits have plunged over 10%—but the largest declines have been in small-cap equities, and the pain has been so acute, we’re starting to see a bounce higher. What’s more, valuations for both small- and mid-cap companies have corrected to levels we usually see during recessions (while large-cap valuations are still in line with their long-term averages).3. The leaders of the next cycle likely won’t be the same as the last—and SMID-cap companies could take the baton.
In the past cycle, growth was synonymous with tech, buoyed by ultra-low interest rates. Looking forward, it’s hard to see mega-cap tech companies maintaining their pace of growth, especially as key markets become more fully penetrated and valuations still look pretty stretched. On the other hand, SMID-cap companies look poised to benefit from increased capital markets activity, a new era of capex spending focused on the real economy (thanks to a greater weighting toward sectors such as industrials, materials and real estate), and the ongoing push to bolster supply chains amid geopolitical tensions (as companies seek to onshore their production).
Investment considerations
Get active
In the end, we believe large-cap stocks are the most important drivers of capital appreciation for investors over the long term. But right now, there is more to the market than just the biggest companies. As cycles turn, small- and mid-cap companies tend to outperform as growth reaccelerates, and we think now is the time to start getting exposure.But this part of the market is not without its risks—SMID-cap stocks tend to be more volatile and hold more debt. In this space, it’s prudent to engage with active managers with proven expertise in selecting quality businesses that have flush balance sheets and which are best suited to the trends of tomorrow.

Morgan investment research reportThese line charts show the returns of large-cap (S&P 500), mid-cap (S&P 400) and small-cap (Russell 2000) equity returns over the past 10 and 25 years. The top chart looks at returns from 2013. Each of the indices tracked each other quite closely between January 2013 and September 2018, with the three market caps returning roughly 90%. From here, there is a pullback. Large caps returned 55% by December, then rose to 123% by February 2020. They dropped to 47% by March 2020, then rose sharply to 215% by January 2022. Returns then dipped and landed at 162% through March 2023. Meanwhile, mid caps fell to 42% by December 2018, rose to 92% by February 2020 and fell to 11% by March 2020. They then rallied to 165% by November 2021, dipped, then rose back to 139% through March 2023. Finally, small caps dipped to 39% in December 2018, rose to 85% by February 2020 and fell to less than 10% by March 2020. They then rose sharply to 167% by November 2021, dipped, then ended at 108% through March 2023. The bottom chart looks at returns since 1998. Large caps returned 40% by August 2000, -22% by March 2003, up to 18% by July 2008, then dipped to -35% by March 2009. They then rallied to 220% by February 2020. They fell to 130% by March 2020 and rallied to 360% by January 2022. They dipped, then ended March 2023 returning 278%. Meanwhile, small caps followed a similar trend, returning 75% by September 2007, -25% by March 2009, 180% by June 2015, 265% by February 2020, dipped to 115% by March 2020. They then rose sharply to 425% by November 2021 and dipped, then rose again to end 2023 at 310%. Finally, mid caps returned 110% by March 2008, dipped to 14% by 2009, then rose sharply to 494% by February 2020. They then fell to 243% by March 2020, rose to 720% by November 2021, then dipped and rose back to 639% through March 2023.This chart shows small- and mid-cap price-to-earnings ratios relative to large-cap equities from 1998 to 2023. Small caps began at 0.75, and rose to 1.4 by July 2002 and 2.1 by August 2009. They then dipped back to 1.1 by November 2012 and rose to 1.6 by April 2015. They fell to 1.1 again by March 2020 before spiking above 2.5 by July 2020. They then fell back to 1 by May 2022 and rose to 1.2 by March 2023. The average over that time period was 1.3.
Meanwhile, mid caps also began at 0.75 and rose steadily to 1.2 by May 2006. They then dipped to 0.9 by November 2008 and rose to 1.3 by May 2011. They steadily fell to 0.7 by May 2022 and rose to 0.8 by March 2023. The average over that time period was 1.This chart shows the small-cap equity performance (represented by the Russell 2000 Index) relative to large caps (S&P 500) through the past six recessions, and the relative performance in the first year of the recovery.

If you'd like a more foundational overview of key concepts of loss harvesting, please visit
this
article – where we discuss how tax loss harvesting can turn market volatility into potential tax savings.
Key takeaways
For investors who want to minimize their tax liabilities on anticipated realized gains in their portfolios,
tax-loss harvesting strategies provide opportunities to generate losses that may create tax alpha and reduce their tax bills at the end of the year.
The historically upwards direction of the markets and the gradual decrease of the portfolio’s cost basis over time, given loss harvesting, can ultimately mute opportunities for tax-loss harvesting over the longer term,
resulting in tax alpha decay.
Even for an investor who doesn’t take proactive action to mitigate tax alpha decay, the market’s natural volatility can help preserve a loss
harvesting strategy’s ability to generate tax alpha in the longer-term
with our research showing that investors may get the welcome benefit of potential tax savings during periods of unwelcome market volatility.
Beyond that, investors can take things into their own hands to prolong the potential benefits of tax-loss harvesting —
for example, by adding cash to their accounts, gifting appreciated securities to a donor-advised fund, and regularly rebalancing their portfolios to create fresh tax lots.Investors that want to reduce their U.S. tax liabilities can do so in multiple ways — such as ensuring that the type of account (i.e., taxable or tax-deferred) is best aligned to the holding type, looking for opportunities to tax-loss harvest, tax-aware borrowing, and considering charitable gifting depending on their intents for their wealth. These approaches ultimately result in “tax alpha” for the investor ( i.e., the incremental value-add resulting from tax-efficient management).
For investors looking to minimize their tax bills on anticipated realized gains in their portfolios, tax-loss harvesting strategies provide opportunities to actively generate losses that may be used to reduce their tax bills at the end of the year. Effectively, these strategies allow investors to keep more of their returns by using market volatility to their advantage. Thanks to innovation in technology and intelligent automation, tax-loss harvesting has gone from a year-end manual process to a best practice made possible all year-round — pinpointing losses across the portfolio and harvesting them, all while keeping the risk attributes of the portfolio intact.
With the increasing adoption of tax-loss harvesting strategies among investors, it’s important to address longer-term expectations. While tax-loss harvesting seeks to enhance a portfolio’s after-tax returns by seeking out potential tax savings, there are a few aspects to be cognizant of that will help investors continue generating tax benefits over the longer term, and that will help achieve the strategic intents for their portfolio.
“Tax alpha decay” is the creeping degradation of after-tax returns over the longer term.
If left unchecked, the tax alpha potential of any tax-loss harvesting strategy is likely to erode over time due to two forces:
(1)
Markets historically go up. Hold on to any stock long enough, and historical market   data shows its value is likely to increase over time. This dynamic means that a client’s potential for tax-loss harvesting is typically highest when first funded, and embedded losses tend to diminish over the long haul.
To illustrate this point, let’s look at the chart below — showing how the percentage stocks at a loss reduces over longer-term return periods (using S&P 500 holdings at the end of 1999 as the starting point).
1
Looking forward during that timeframe, a higher percentage of stocks that you started with will tend to be at gains, making the process of finding losses to harvest all the more challenging.
Percentage of stocks at a loss reduces over longer-term return periods (using S&P holdings at the end of 1999 as the starting point)
1(2)
As losses are harvested in the portfolio, its cost basis will decrease over time. If the stocks purchased as substitutes for the ones that were harvested do well, it increases the spread between the price at which they’re bought (their cost basis) and the stock’s current value.
The combination of the historically upward direction of the market and the gradual decrease of the portfolio’s cost basis over time can ultimately mute the opportunities for tax-loss harvesting over the longer-term, resulting in tax alpha decay.Even if you don’t take action, the market’s natural volatility can help extend benefits of tax-loss harvesting and delay tax alpha decay
.
Market volatility is the primary source of losses to harvest and turn into tax benefits, and can help preserve a loss harvesting strategy’s ability to generate tax alpha — even if an investor chooses to just wait for the next bout of volatility rather than take proactive action to delay tax alpha decay.
Our analysis shows that while the potential for tax alpha may decrease over time, it does not necessarily go to zero — given the ongoing divergence in individual stock returns that occurs even in upward-trending markets. In the figure below, we show the average tax alpha relative to the S&P 500 Index by years since funding, for hypothetical portfolios incepted in each year beginning in 2010 and held through 2021. The portfolios sought to deliver returns similar to the S&P 500 Index, while harvesting losses on a monthly basis in order to enhance after-tax returns.
2
While tax alpha did decrease meaningfully after the first few years, the potential for tax alpha remained even in later years — with 80 basis-point average tax alpha in years 5–12.To drill one layer deeper into the relationship between potential tax savings and market volatility, we analyzed monthly tax alpha

alongside VIX levels
4
— with the data showing that
investors may get the welcome benefit of potential tax savings during periods of unwelcome market volatility.While it might be an unattractive environment for most investors, prolonged periods of volatility can effectively extend the potential benefits that we tend to see early on with tax-loss harvesting accounts and help delay tax alpha decay.
Rather than wait for the next bout of volatility, here are three steps investors can proactively take to mitigate tax alpha decay and optimize tax efficiency of their portfolios.
Investors can take matters into their own hands by contributing cash into their accounts to introduce fresh tax lots.
5
New dollars invested create a new (many times higher) cost basis, so any ensuing volatility after a cash contribution may create additional opportunities for harvesting those fresh tax lots. To illustrate that, we compared tax alpha over 12 years for two portfolios —both incepted in 2010. Portfolio A (represented by the navy bar) stayed invested without any subsequent cash contributions post-inception. Portfolio B (represented by the teal bar) also stayed invested — but made cash contributions of 5% of its market value at the beginning of each year starting in 2010.
6
Portfolio B’s annual cash contributions injected a fresh set of tax lots each year into the account, increasing the opportunity for tax-loss harvesting to take advantage of any subsequent market volatility. Portfolio B’s cumulative tax alpha experience became increasingly better over time relative to Portfolio A —
with 4.5% of additional cumulative tax alpha at the end of 2021 given the annual cash contributions into the account.Investors who have philanthropy as one of the objectives for their wealth can benefit from potential tax deductions by gifting appreciated securities (e.g., to a donor-advised fund).
For investors who itemize deductions on their tax returns instead of taking the standard deduction, gifting qualified appreciated stock that has been held for over a year (e.g., to a donor-advised fund) can unlock an additional way to save more on taxes.
Donating stock that’s been held for over a year to charity generally allows the investor to take a tax deduction for the full fair market value — subject to limitations based on adjusted gross income — that can be used in the tax year in which the gift is made with any excess charitable deductions carried forward for use in five subsequent years. Furthermore, the capital gains tax that would be incurred from selling the stock and donating the proceeds can potentially be eliminated — increasing the value of the charitable contribution by over 20%.
7
Once appreciated stock is donated, the portfolio can be replenished with cash to purchase the same or similar stock.
8
This will create fresh tax lots with higher cost bases —
complementing the tax benefit of charitable gifting by leading the way for additional tax-loss harvesting opportunities and extending the runway for tax benefits.
9By regularly monitoring and rebalancing their portfolios, investors can create more fresh tax lots — leading to new potential opportunities for ongoing harvesting.
A robust approach to rebalancing is key to keeping the portfolio in line with its investment objectives. In addition to that, new tax lots created with the proceeds of trimming outsized exposures can provide additional runway for tax-loss harvesting, extending the benefits of a loss-harvesting strategy.

For investors who are looking to reduce their tax bills on anticipated realized gains, ongoing tax-loss harvesting is a powerful tool that can potentially help them keep more dollars invested and enhance after-tax returns. In addition to a thoughtful planning and execution of a tax-loss harvesting strategy, there are additional steps that investors can take to get the most from their tax-smart investments.

This hypothetical example is for illustrative purposes only. Rates shown assume top tax rate at federal level, including 3.8% Medicare surtax, and doesn’t take into account any state or local taxes. The tax savings shown is the tax deduction multiplied by the donor’s income tax rate (40.8% in this example), minus the long-term capital gains taxes paid. This example assumes that the taxpayer has adjusted gross income (AGI) of $1 million per year. Cash contributions to donor-advised funds are deductible up to 60% of the taxpayer's AGI.
The fair market value of appreciated stock contributions to donor-advised funds are deductible up to 30% of the taxpayer's AGI.
Contributions in excess of the percentage limitation may be carried forward for use by the taxpayer in the next five tax years.Area chart illustrating the % of S&P 500 stocks with negative returns (y-axis) through 2021, using S&P 500 holdings at the end of 1999 as the starting point. S&P 500 holdings were taken at the end of 1999, and performance of those holdings was calculated over the listed time frames, showing total percentage of stocks at a loss for the time frames listed. The chart articulates the point that the percentage of stocks at a loss reduces over longer-term return periods. The percentage of stocks with negative returns spiked up to around ~50% during major historical events such as 9/11 and the Great Financial Crisis of 2007-2008, but steadily declined otherwise.Bar chart of the average tax alpha relative to the S&P 500 Index by years since funding from 2010 through 2021.

Analysis period is between 2007-2021. To construct the analysis, we simulated a cash-funded portfolio that was created on the first day of each year and subsequently rebalanced on a monthly basis if tax-loss harvesting opportunities were present or tracking error exceeded 1%. The chart shows that months with the highest VIX level also experienced the highest tax alpha, ranging up to 3%. From these results, we can see that investors may experience potential tax savings during periods of market volatility.

Portfolio A illustrates no cash contributions to the portfolio over the 12 years represented, while Portfolio B contributed 5% of its value in cash annually. Each portfolio is rebalanced on a monthly basis if tax loss harvesting opportunities exist, or if expected tracking error exceeds 1%. Portfolio B saw 4.5% of additional cumulative tax alpha at the end of 2021 given additional loss harvesting opportunities created by fresh tax lots from annual cash contributions.

Both scenarios assume that the client has adjusted gross income (AGI) of $1mm per year. The client who donated the qualified appreciated stock directly to the DAF saves ~$33,510  more on taxes and was able to donate an additional $23,800 to the DAF.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.We expect real economy stocks to outperform digital growth stocks over the coming decade.We’re in a new market regime.
Post-pandemic reopening and the Federal Reserve’s aggressive rate hiking cycle have catalyzed a dramatic shift in equity market leadership. The fastest-growing companies—the ones that thrived during the post-global-financial-crisis era of exceptionally low interest rates, and through the more recent period of social distancing—have suffered. Meanwhile, companies that derive their revenues from the “real economy,” and return a larger share of profits to investors, have outperformed.
We believe the outperformance of real economy stocks over digital growth stocks could last for several years, or even through the next decade, if history serves as a guide.
In many ways, this new regime recalls the investing environment of the early 1980s. A spike in interest rates to fight double-digit inflation, known as the “Volcker shock” for Federal Reserve Chair Paul Volcker, marked the beginning of a multi-year stretch of growth stock underperformance. The rate shock led companies to profoundly change how they allocated capital and structured their operations. It also triggered the deep recession of 1981–82.
We see parallels with, and some notable differences from, the current juncture. Today, inflation is cooling, and if the U.S. economy were to slip into recession in 2023 it would likely not be as deep as the recession of 1981-82. But the past year’s interest rate shock, sparked by economic reopening and surging inflation, will have far-reaching effects. We think it will influence both corporate decision making—management teams will prioritize profits over growth—and investor preferences.
It’s the beginning of a multi-year transition back toward the real economy, we believe, with at least four important implications for investors:
Mega-cap tech stocks will no longer dominate as market leaders
The energy transition needs capital
Manufacturing companies could outperform
Active managers can find ample opportunity to pick secular winners
Lessons of history: When equity market leadership has shifted
Today’s market shift in focus from growth to the real economy echoes earlier market transitions. They were catalyzed by wars, new technologies and energy supply shocks, among other forces.
The chart below, which covers nearly 100 years of data, tells the story. Boom cycles occur when new growth opportunities offer high prospective returns (the dark blue sections of the line). As capital flows toward those opportunities, funds become relatively scarce for out-of-favor sectors of the real economy. Eventually, the high-growth areas become oversaturated, and prospective returns move higher in the areas that have been ignored. The cycle then restarts (the teal sections of the line).
Interestingly, while certain economic sectors tend to outperform during growth cycles (notably technology and healthcare), we find no clear pattern of sector outperformance during real economy cycles. Rather, investors tend to favor the dividend factor and generally prefer value to growth equities.
Real economy cycles may include periods of strong growth stock performance. For example, year-to-date, the information technology sector of the S&P 500 is up about 9.5%. This is a notable gain, but in our view, no harbinger of a new growth cycle.The 2010s: Digital asset bullishness, manufacturing shortages
The roots of the recent market shift can be found in the 2010s. Over the decade, investment in physical capital stagnated, even as expected returns to physical capital remained high. To some extent, this made sense. Investment choices reflected the growing value of nonphysical, digital assets such as software.
But in some cases, the gap between investment in physical and nonphysical assets looked extreme. As investors saw nearly unlimited promise in electric vehicles, videoconferencing, cryptocurrencies and the metaverse (among other new endeavors), their perception created an unprecedented gap between the total enterprise value of the corporate sector and its stock of physical assets.
This ratio is known as Tobin’s q (chart below). In the 2010s, investors essentially dismissed the gap between Tobin’s q and investment in physical assets. Instead, they emphasized the value of intangibles. Capital pricing was reasonable, the argument went, because in the digital age, physical capital
should
make up less of a firm’s overall value.Then came the COVID-19 pandemic. For various reasons (including supply chain issues), shortages of physical items—cars, houses, furniture, energy—emerged or intensified. Yet investors continued to pour capital into speculative assets such as young unprofitable companies (YUCs), special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) and cryptocurrencies.In many ways the state of the U.S. economy in 2021 resembled the late 1970s period that set off the Volcker shock: Too much demand against limited supply in the real economy.
Like the Fed of the early 1980s, the Fed in 2022 responded with an aggressive tightening cycle. It aimed to force demand back into balance with limited supply, and thus bring inflation to heel.
1
Indeed, the 2022 spike in real interest rates ranks as the most dramatic since the Volcker shock.What’s next? As we consider how the U.S. economy and markets might evolve in the 2020s, we think it’s useful to look back at the 1980s.
IBM and the demise of the 1980s tech stars
The IBM story and the underperformance of tech stocks in the 1980s offer instructive parallels to the current shift in market regime. Then as now, higher interest rates played a critical role as investors turned away from growth stocks and especially the tech stars of the earlier regime.
IBM was the tech darling of the so-called “Nifty 50,” blue-chip stocks (including Avon Products, Coca-Cola and General Electric) that significantly outperformed the broader market in the decades following World War II.
2
Investors thought these stocks could be “bought and held forever” and that “no price was too high for them.”
3
Sound familiar?
IBM shares delivered a 5x outperformance relative to overall market through the 1950s and 1960s, with the stock peaking at 6x in 1973. IBM shares then collapsed precipitously relative to the market, continuing to fall through most of the 1980s.
IBM’s stock underperformed through the 1980s even as the company commercialized new and innovative products. In 1981, IBM debuted its first personal computer, the IBM PC Model 5150. Notably, it was among the first open architecture PCs: Other companies could produce hardware and software compatible with the PC5150.
Yet, as the chart below shows, the debut of IBM’s PC came in the midst of IBM’s secular underperformance.To be sure, various factors contributed to that underperformance. IBM, weighed down by a hidebound bureaucracy, made a series of missteps, ceding the computer operating system business to Microsoft (Windows) and the microprocessor business to Intel.
In addition, IBM found itself bogged down in a 13-year Department of Justice antitrust case that began in 1969. The legal battle may have prevented IBM from stifling younger competitors (Apple and Microsoft) in the PC and software industry.
4
IBM’s post-1980s evolution is equally instructive. In 1993, a new CEO (Louis Gerstner) took the reins, keeping IBM intact amid calls for a breakup, and by the mid 1990s, IBM stock once again outperformed during the dot-com boom. Over the subsequent decades, through various corporate strategies and business environments, IBM essentially evolved into a stable, cash-flow-generating company.
Today, IBM is categorized as a value stock. Dividends accounted for more than 70% of its total return over the last 20 years (compared with around 20% for the tech sector as a whole).
Might IBM’s trajectory hold lessons for some of the tech darlings of the past decade? We expect so.
Cutting costs and boosting fixed investment in the 1980s
In the early 1980s, dramatically higher interest rates led to sweeping cost cuts, waves of layoffs and what became known as the first “offshoring recession.” Companies improved efficiencies by shifting production outside the United States (Mexico and China were the main beneficiaries). The recession fell hardest on lower-wage workers. While earlier layoffs were typically temporary furloughs, the 1980s brought the first wave of permanent layoffs. A new term, “displaced worker,” entered the lexicon.
Today, companies are again cutting costs in the context of higher interest rates. But unlike the 1980s, recent layoffs appear to be mainly hitting higher-wage workers (at least so far), mostly in the tech sector. Within this sector, layoffs have typically targeted unprofitable units such as the Alexa unit of Amazon or the blockchain/Libra unit at Meta.Even as U.S. companies downsized their payrolls in the 1980s, they boosted their fixed investments. The pressure to cut costs forced companies to invest in automation and other new technologies. In addition, businesses streamlined their supply chain systems by adopting new conceptual frameworks such as Six Sigma data analytics. (Motorola was the first to implement the program in the 1980s.)
5
Just-in-time production, which Japanese automakers introduced and mastered, aimed to make a company’s manufacturing process leaner and more cost-efficient. In the wake of the 1980s U.S.-Japan trade war, Japanese car companies built U.S. factories—powered by just-in-time production—to avoid tariffs on their auto exports. Their U.S. competitors soon adopted their own iterations of just-in-time production.

Influenced by these shifts, manufacturing productivity growth picked up speed in the 1980s, reflecting the coincident strong fixed investment cycle.
We see clear parallels to today. Amid costs cuts and layoffs, we expect a significant increase in physical investment in the 2020s.Investor preferences in the 1980s: Shareholder value, dividends, big box retail
As higher rates catalyzed changes in corporate strategy and practice, they also set the table for a shift in investor preferences.
We see the change most clearly in the rise of shareholder value as a new corporate doctrine. CEOs increasingly emphasized boosting shareholder value by making profits and returns the locus of their attention.
Although high interest rates didn’t directly cause the rise of shareholder value, they did force management teams to make their companies’ equity more competitive relative to bonds. Companies thus raised their dividends to make their stock more attractive to investors.
7
Dividends rose as a share of corporate earnings and of overall market capitalization in the 1980s.
8We can see other shifts in investor preferences in the 1980s. Against a backdrop of higher interest rates, investors favored value stocks over growth stocks and sought attractive dividend payouts. High-dividend stocks outperformed both the tech sector (including IBM) and low-dividend stocks in the 1980s (charts below).
New investment themes emerged. Chief among them: big box retail, led by fast-growing Walmart and Home Depot, which benefited from corporate cost-cutting, globalization and automation.
Big box retailers also got a boost from the 1980
Motor Carrier Act
that deregulated the U.S. trucking industry. This law slashed the cost of moving goods around the United States by bringing more competition into the sector. Companies that were able to take advantage of the reduction in shipping costs thrived.
So too did their stock prices.By any measure, Home Depot and Walmart dramatically outperformed. In the 1980s, the tech sector trailed the overall market by about 50%, while Home Depot and Walmart outperformed by 1,200% and 460%, respectively.Investment implications
What does the shift in market regime mean for your portfolio?
First, if you loaded up on growth stocks during the past decade, your portfolio may not be best positioned to benefit from the change in market regime.
Although it is still in the early days, we think a real economy cycle will give investors the incentive to direct capital into addressing the needs and stresses that have emerged in a wide range of sectors. These include traditional and clean energy, housing, infrastructure and manufacturing.
Investors may continue to prefer companies that deliver consistent real returns to shareholders in the near term, instead of those that prioritize growth at all costs. Management teams will likely renew their focuses on profitability and return to shareholders.
We see four important implications for investors:
Mega-cap tech stocks may no longer dominate as market leaders.
One corollary: Investors should consider prioritizing cash return.
The addressable markets targeted by the past cycle’s mega-cap tech leaders look increasingly saturated. Certainly, their pre-2022 growth rates seem unsustainable. Investors will likely view these stocks as funding sources for investments in other areas. Companies that made ill-considered capital investments in nascent digital growth initiatives, as opposed to those focused on shareholder return, may be particularly at risk.
On the other hand, we think investors will embrace real economy stocks (industrials, commodities, the energy sectors, and other sectors that have prioritized shareholder return over expansion). Similarly, dividends and dividend growth will likely be valued by investors who increasingly view fixed income as a viable alternative to stocks. At the same time, some contingent of the past cycle’s tech leaders will—like IBM in an earlier era—make the transition into a stable, steady grower and high-dividend stock.
The energy transition needs capital.
Traditional energy companies have maintained capital discipline and prioritized shareholder return. Going forward, they should still provide investors with attractive dividend and cash flow yields, and relatively undemanding valuations. But the transition to clean energy is very much underway. It will require significant capital in the coming years, and is likely to benefit from government policy support and incentives. The transition offers compelling growth opportunities for long-term investors, we believe.
Manufacturing companies could outperform.
Even though inflation is normalizing, shortages in the real economy still exist. The companies that produce semiconductors, homes and housing-related materials, battery storage facilities, infrastructure and machinery could enjoy a durable tailwind. Small- and mid-cap companies also tend to do well during periods of elevated capital expenditures.
Active managers should find ample opportunity to pick emerging secular winners.
Market indices have become more concentrated in recent years, as the largest companies make up a growing share of, say, the S&P 500. As Michael Cembalest has written,
9
central bank policy in the wake of the 2009 recession led to collapsing risk premia and falling relative valuation spreads in equities and risky credit markets.
We expect increased dispersion within equity markets. One key reason: Real economy cycles feature more variability of top performing sectors compared with growth cycles, when returns historically have been concentrated in technology and healthcare. Greater dispersion could enable active managers to deliver excess returns relative to market-cap-weighted benchmarks.
Finally, as companies and investors redirect and redeploy capital, we think active managers can potentially identify the emerging secular winners of the unfolding real economy cycle (just like those who were able to spot the theme of big box retail in the 1980s). That could be a trend with enduring long-term power.
We can help
When market regimes change, it is important to consider a wide array of investment options. Your J.P. Morgan team can help you evaluate what equity strategies may help you achieve your long-term goals.1
We note one important difference between the late 1970s and today: Inflation expectations continue to be anchored at the Fed’s 2% inflation target, whereas in the 1970s, inflation expectations became de-anchored to such a degree that the Fed (arguably) had no choice but to engineer a deep economic downturn to crush inflation. Today’s anchored inflation expectations suggest the Fed has more flexibility than it did in the late 1970s. In the view of many economists, today’s anchored expectations also signal that a recession in 2023, should it occur, likely would not be as deep as the early 1980s recession.

Yener Altunbaş Blaise Gadanecz and Alper Kara, “The evolution of syndicated loan markets,” The Service Industries Journal Volume 26, Issue 6, January 25, 2007. Along with high interest rates, the explosion of leveraged buyouts (LBOs) in the 1980s spurred many management teams to boost their dividends (and deploy various “poison pills”) to stave off hostile bidders. Amid a wave of corporate restructurings, LBOs became an efficient way to bring in new management, cut costs and raise dividends. Almost non-existent in 1980, LBOs accounted for more than 400 deals totaling more than $180 billion in transaction volume (3.5% of GDP) by 1988. Over the years, LBOs evolved to become the modern private equity sector.

Share buybacks also rose in the 1980s following the 1982 SEC rule change that established “safe harbor” guidelines for companies engaging in buybacks. Specifically, the rule change provided a framework for companies to repurchase their own shares without running afoul of securities laws. Buybacks didn’t become a dominant feature of returns until the 2000s, when there was a secular rise in the share of companies buying back their stocks (to 53% by 2018 from 28% in 1980). See:

Michael Cembalest,
2023 Eye on the Market Outlook,
Jan. 1, 2023The chart below, which covers 100 years of data, tells the story. Boom cycles occur when new growth opportunities offer high prospective returns (the dark blue sections of the line). As capital flows toward those opportunities, funds become relatively scarce for out-of-favor sectors of the real economy. Eventually, the high-growth areas become oversaturated, and prospective returns move higher in the areas that have been ignored. The cycle then restarts (the teal sections of the line).For the rate of physical investment in the corporate sector, it started it dropped to 9% in 1993 before it went back up to a peak of 12.5% in 2000. Shortly after, it declined to 7.6% in 2003. It then climbed back up to 11.4% in 2008 and came back down immediately to 8% in 2009. Then it fluctuated back up to 10.6% in 2012 and came all the way down to 6.6% as of 2020.   For the expected returns Tobin’s q, it started low at 1.4 in January 1990 and reached its peak at 3.3 in 1999. Then it came to a bottom at 1.8 in 2008 but bounced back to 3.2 as of 2020.In March 2013, the insufficient supply of materials was at 5.6% and it rose to 9.8% in September 2018. It stayed relatively flat until it reached 8.8% in June 2020. Then it skyrocketed to 43.7% in December 2021 and came back down a bit to 38.8% as of June 2022.   In March 2013, the insufficient supply of labor came in at 6.8%, which rose to 22% in September 2018. Then it trended downward until it reached a bottom of 14.5% in June 2020. Then it climbed all the way to its record high at 45.8% in March 2022 and came back down a bit since to 44.2% in June 2022.The left side column shows the investments in speculative digital assets such as SPACs/Crypto/YUCs during the years from 2015 to 2020, which added to a total of 4 trillion dollars. The right-side column shows the investments in physical asset from 2015 to 2020 which was 2.8 trillion dollars.The first data point came in January 1960 at 4.1%, which then declined to 2% in January 1961. Later it reached a new high in April 1970 at 4.5% before it dropped back down to a low of 0.7% in October 1975. It soon climbed to a new high at 5.8% in January 1982, and went back down to 1% in October 1991. Then it peaked again at 4.3% in January 2000 before it dropped all the way down and turned negative for the first time in October 2011 at -0.04%. Later it made its way back to a high point of 1% in October 2018 and turned negative again in April 2020 at -0.5% before it came back up to the latest data point of 1.5% as of October 2022.The first data point came in at -2% in January 1961 and went up and down until it reached a peak at 2.9% in July 1981 as a result of Volcker Rates Shock. Then it suddenly came to a low of -2.7% in January 1983 before gradually moving back up to a new high at 1.6% in April 1994. It went down to a low of -1.5% in January 2003 and came back to a high of 0.6% in October 2008 before it went back down to -1.5% in January 2012. It then jumped to a peak of 1% in January 2014 and declined to -1.2% in October 2020. Lastly, it went back up to the latest point of 2.4% as of October 2022 in which the 2022 rates shock played an important role.It’s indexed at 100 for the first data point from January 1945. It rose across the curve until it reached a high of 599 in June 1973 before it went all the way down to 203 in October 1981. It had a short-lived comeback to 351 in December 1984 and had a sharp decline until it reached the bottom at 45 in September 1993. It then climbed back up to a peak at 237 in August 1999 before it declined all the way to the latest datapoint of 59 in July 2022.Higher wage workers refers to all employees less production and nonsupervisory, whereas lower wage refers to production and nonsupervisory employees.  The data is indexed so that June 1979=100.   For higher wage workers, the first datapoint came in at 87 in January 1976 and it went all the way up to 104 in January 1982. Then it declined to 98 in March 1983 before it came back up to 104 in July 1985. It hovered around the same level until the last data point which came in at 104 in February 1989. For lower wage workers, the first datapoint came in at 89 in January 1976 and it reached 100 in 1979 before it declined to a trough at 81 in December 1982. It then came back up to 88 and hovered around the same level until the last data point of 88 in February 1989.For those with income greater than $100k, the first data point came in at 37% in January 2014 and reached a peak at 54% in March 2020. Then it went all the way down to a bottom of 29% in June 2021 before it climb back up to 48% in January 2023.  For those with income less than $50k, the first data point came in at 41% in January 2014 and since then it was fluctuating downwards until it bottomed out at 32 in December 2019. Soon after, it went straight up to 50 in March 2020 before it went on a downward spiral again until it bottomed at 32 in July 2021. The last data point came in at 36 in January 2023.For the early 80s recession, it came in at 133 at -2 years from cycle trough and it reached its indexed 0 at 0 year from cycle trough, also being the recession year but soon it soared all the way to the peak of 187 at 4 years from cycle trough.  For the average of prior 5 cycles, the curve is much smoother as the first data point came in at 106 at -2 years from cycle trough and reached 130 3 years after cycle trough and declined in the fourth year to 123, which was also the last data point.The first data point came in at 2.7% in March 1965, which then fluctuates and declined to a low of 0.8% in December 1981. Then the data trended upward until it peaked at 4.2% in December 1986. Later it declined to 1.9% in June 1991 before it climbed back up again and reached its peak at 5.4% in September 2003. Since then, the data went on a steady decline until it bottomed out at -1.2% in September 2019. It then recovered upward, and the last data point came in at 0.2% in September 2022.For Dow Jones, the first data point came in at 53% in December 1955 and it plateaued at 56% in September 1967 and stayed near that level until it dropped to a bottom of 42% in December 1981. It then climbed up again until it got to 54% in March 1994 before it went down and reached a new low of 37% in June 2007. Then it went through a few more short cycles and eventually ended at 41% in September 2022.  For S&P, the first data point came in at 57% in December 1955 and it went up to a peak of 64% in March 1965 before it came down to a bottom of 44% in June 1981. Then it went up and peaked at 63% in December 1991 and later came back down again to a new bottom of 39% in September 2004. Shortly after, it went back up to 53% in September 2009 before another decline. The last data point came in at 43% in September 2022.The first data point came in at 4.3% in September 1952 and it trended downward until it bottomed at 2.8% in March 1973. Shortly after, it went on a wild ride until it reached 7.3% in September 1982 before it went back down again to a new low of 2.2% in September 2000. Then it went up again and peaked at 5.2% in June 2009 before it came back down and ended at 3% in September 2022.The first data point started at 100 in January 1945, and it went on an upward ride until it reached 1219 in June 1998. It then had a short-lived pull back until it bottomed at 724 in February 2000. Then it rose again until it reached the peak at 1947 in March 2007. Soon after it went on a long decline until it got to 824 in September 2020. It then had a nice increase until the latest data point of 1356 in October 2022.On a separate line, it shows the performance ratio of stocks in the top 20 percentile of dividend yield relative to tech sector.  	Both lines are indexed at 100 as of Q1 1945.  For the top 20 percentile of DY vs the bottom 20 percentile of DY, the first data point came in at 100 in Q1 1945. Then it climbed to a high of 247 in Q4 1977 before it dropped to a low of 124 in Q4 1980. Then it rose again to 288 in Q1 1990 and fell again to 154 in Q1 2000 after which it went on a big rise until it peaked at 487 in Q3 2012. It then had a drawdown and bottomed at 251 in Q3 2020. The latest data point came in at 362 in Q3 2022.  For the top 20 percentile of dividend yield relative to tech sector, the first data point came in at 100 also as indexed in Q1 1945. It trended downward and bottomed at 55 in Q1 1970 after which it had a big rally until it peaked at 281 in Q2 1992. Then it declined again and bottomed out at 60 in Q1 2000. Shortly after, it went back up again and topped at 338 in Q1 2007. Then it swinged back down and ended at 143 in Q2 2022.For Home Depot, going from the index level of 2, the relative total return rose from 2 in September 1981 to a peak of 4.1 in December 1999. Then it went down until it reached 3.4 in July 2008 before another long rise until the latest datapoint of 4.1 in September 2022.  For Walmart, going from the index level of 2, the relative total return rose from 2 in September 1981 to a peak of 3.2 in December 1999. Then it trended slightly downward for the later years until the latest datapoint which came in at 2.9 in September 2022.  For IBM, going from the index level of 2, the relative total return rose slightly to 2.2 in February 1985 before going on a long decline until it bottomed at 1.3 in September 1993. It came back up to 2 in May 1999 and stayed relatively flat until it got to 1.9 in November 2011. Then it went on a slow decline and the latest datapoint came in at 1.4 in September 2022.  For the tech sector, also going from the index level of 2, the relative total return for the tech sector has remained nearly flat for the entire data series. First it went down to 1.7 in August 1992 and deviated from the flat line when it peaked at 2.3 in March 2000. For the rest, it has been flat between 1.5 and 2 and the data series ended at 1.9 in September 2022.Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.

Market thoughts
On edge
Are storm clouds brewing? A bank stock blowup and word of more Federal Reserve rate hikes prompted market turmoil this week. Heading into Friday, the S&P 500 has lost over
-3%
(on track for the worst week since December), and bond yields have swung wildly—both 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields have whipsawed some 30–40 basis points (bps).
So what happened?
1) Banks had their worst day in almost three years yesterday, erasing all of their 2023 gains. The moves are hard to overlook, given banks are often seen as a barometer for the wider economy
.The Fed’s regime of higher rates is dialing up the pressure, especially on smaller regional banks that tend to be less diversified. For months, once high-flying parts of the market that relied on easy money, such as crypto, venture capital and startups, and commercial real estate, have been under the hammer. Now, that weakness is reverberating through the banks most exposed to them.
Silicon Valley Bank, lender to tech start-ups and other VCs, saw its worst day ever as it announced its clients were withdrawing deposits. This prompted the bank to sell hoards of securities at a loss to improve its liquidity. Meanwhile, crypto-focused bank Silvergate Capital said it’s shutting down after weeks of turmoil (in large part due to outsized exposure to beleaguered FTX). And Cleveland-based Keycorp said it anticipates less net interest income as it faces tougher competition to offer attractive deposit rates.
Here’s the problem: With interest rates higher, banks are under pressure to up the ante on deposits (i.e., pay more) to keep savers in the door—if they can’t hack it, they risk their customers going elsewhere. Similarly, if times turn hard, clients might start burning through their cash too quickly, wearing down banks’ deposit base. In turn, panic about a downturn might also prompt others to yank their deposits, risking a bank run. That puts pressure on banks’ balance sheets, as securities invested when rates were low may need to be sold at a loss in order to buffer liquidity. Adding fuel to the fire, the higher rates go, the less likely businesses and consumers are to make new loans (and generate new business for banks).
All that said, the pain has been mostly felt by smaller regional banks, given their deposit bases have been quicker to flight, and their balance sheets tend to be riskier relative to larger banks.
Here’s the good news:
Many of the larger, money center banks are far more diversified, more regulated and have fortress balance sheets—and thus aren’t feeling these stresses as acutely. This has left the banking sector as a whole much better capitalized today than it was during the Global Financial Crisis.But this does underscore the impact that tighter policy can have. As interest rates rise, it becomes more difficult to borrow, invest and spend. The Fed’s next move is in acute focus, which stresses the importance of today’s U.S. jobs report (and next week’s CPI print).
This brings us to the following point.
2) The Fed may keep rates higher for longer—but it all depends on just how strong the economy stays.
At his testimony on Capitol Hill this week, Chair Powell doubled down on the Fed’s commitment to cooling inflation, signaling that central bankers could take policy rates higher still and ramp up the pace of hikes—but it all depends on the data. On one hand, growth is still strong, and inflation is still sticky, which could prompt a 50-basis-point move at this month’s meeting (following the step down to 25 bps in the last few meetings). But on the other hand, there were promising signs in today’s jobs report that suggest upping the pace might not be needed after all.Today’s jobs report showed that
the U.S. economy added another 311,000 jobs (following January’s blockbuster 504,000), in a sign that the economy is still strong. But the Fed did get a few encouraging signs that it’s getting closer to getting its job done—the unemployment rate rose to 3.6% (from 3.4%), and wage growth was cooler than expected (at 4.6% year-over-year). While still a mixed reading overall, it may go to taking some of the edge off.
The jury is still out on the Fed’s next move at its March meeting, but the more it has to hike, the greater the potential hit to the economy—and the greater risk of recession.
Where to go from here:
So far this year, markets have quickly flitted between soft, no, and hard landing. Late cycle comes with transitions, and defensive positioning and diversification have historically been a good defense.
Bonds can provide crucial protection. The swift move lower in yields yesterday reminds us of the shield bonds can provide as the growth outlook worsens. We continue to focus on high-quality, investment grade credit. And while banks overall make up roughly 25% of the U.S. investment grade market, regional domestic banks account for just 1.5% of the universe.
Further, this is why we’ve been focused on parts of the equity market that are higher quality in nature, backed by more secular growth and/or that can offer better relative value—for instance, healthcare and industrials rather than financials in the United States, as well as Europe and China. Strategies such as structured notes can also offer downside protection and help to protect gains.
Above all, stick with your investment plan. While markets can always have a bad day, week, month or even year, history suggests investors are less likely to suffer losses over longer periods—especially in a diversified portfolio.All market and economic data as of March 2023 and sourced from Bloomberg Finance L.P. and FactSet unless otherwise stated.

Kevin Tompkins, Vice President, Cyber Advisory
Today, few organizations are immune to cyberattacks. Family offices and small businesses are no exception.
Increasingly, small organizations are being targeted with the same phishing, malware and ransomware attacks that each year cost bigger businesses trillions of dollars in losses.
1
It’s therefore essential for them to develop robust cybersecurity controls and have a well-thought-out recovery plan in place—hopefully before a cyber breach occurs.
A cautionary tale
Cybersecurity for a family office client that was managing investments, real estate properties and day-to-day finances for several generations of one family, primarily depended on weekly backups of data and systems—plus incremental backups every night. The office team believed this two-pronged strategy would allow them to recover data from many different points in time if a problem ever arose.
Unfortunately, a ransomware attack quickly revealed the flaws in this approach: All of the office’s day-to-day systems as well as its backups were stored on the same network.
Hackers were able to gain control of all of the office’s systems and information, and demanded a ransom of $500,000. Initially, the family declined to pay the ransom, hoping to find a workaround. But after a 10-day shutdown of the office, they paid the ransom to restore their systems.
Steps to take now
J.P. Morgan’s cybersecurity specialists can help you develop, test and execute resiliency plans in the event of a cyberattack. Here are some of their recommendations to help you get started:
Manage people and processes
Put an employee training program in place—
Many cyberattacks start with phishing or malware. Teach your employees how to identify and report suspicious emails or other online activities. Periodically, test their knowledge and skills.
Limit employees’ internet access from company-owned devices—
Reducing the number of sites employees can visit can reduce the likelihood of malware being introduced into your operations.
Add an advanced spam-filtering service to your operations—
A spam filter can help you identify and block phishing emails and reduce the likelihood of someone on your staff responding to a spoofed email domain. Even better: Opt for a spam filter that includes these features:
URL rewriting—Analyzes links sent in emails and blocks users from accessing potentially malicious websites.
Attachment sandboxing
—
Automatically opens and scans files attached to incoming emails to detect if malware or viruses are hidden in them.
Email impersonation detection
—
Helps identify if a sender is attempting to impersonate a colleague’s or business partner’s email account.
Install system patches and software updates as soon as they become available—
Prioritize patching efforts according to:
The types of data contained in a given system.
Their degree of importance to your overall operations.
The likelihood of the patches themselves disrupting business operations.
Have a backup plan
Create multiple data backups—
To restore systems in the wake of a cyberattack, consider storing copies on cloud services or completely offline.
Conduct a business impact analysis
—Assess the potential consequences of a cyberattack on your operations as well as on your recovery strategy. For example:
Could your business operate offline if no online systems are available?
How would you make crucial payments?
Which systems would need to be recovered first?
Who inside the organization would make critical decisions?
What outside parties (partners, regulators, press, customers/clients) would need to be notified if a cyberbreach occurred?
Don’t go at it alone
Develop a relationship with a cyber-resiliency partner before an incident occurs—
A partnership with a digital forensics and incident response firm, for example, can help you mitigate the impact of an attack and reduce the amount of time it takes to recover.
Supplement your recovery plans with a cybersecurity insurance policy
—This can help defray a portion of the losses you may incur.
Test the strength of your system security
—Have an IT and security provider assess the strength of your cyber protections and implement more robust controls and technologies, if needed.
Document and practice
Create a playbook—
Take the time to map a clear path to recovering from a cyberattack.
Conduct regular reviews
—Practice and update your resiliency plans on a regular basis to ensure they will be executed successfully in the event of an incident.

1
The pandemic catalyzed edtech adoption, as years of digitalization and technological advances were compressed, implemented rapidly over the span of a few months.
2
Investments followed this same trajectory. Between 2020 and 2021 edtech ventures raised over US$35bn dollars globally, the same amount recorded in the five years before the pandemic.
3
In Latin America, investments in 2021 were sixfold the funding in previous years.
4
However, edtech funding in the region remains low relative to global investments over the past decade, having raised just US$1bn compared with US$68.6bn globally.
5
While edtech investments are now stabilizing after such explosive growth, they are still projected to remain above their pre-covid levels, thereby demonstrating their long-term potential.
6
In order to assess this potential, this article explores which investments are working, what challenges edtech can successfully solve, where there’s opportunity, and what future edtech prospects might look like. Our analysis indicates that over the short term upskilling and workforce education, which currently represent the largest share of edtech investments, are likely to continue gaining traction. These areas address the urgent skills gap that prevails in the region and help meet the increasing demands from nearshoring, but do not face the same barriers to entry that other types of edtech innovations will have to overcome.
LatAm’s need for edtech
Latin America has just under half a billion people demanding innovation in literacy and numeracy, as well as the acquisition of 21st-century skills and knowledge. In Argentina, 73% of companies struggle to hire staff with the right skill sets. 67% of Peruvian companies report a talent shortage and difficulty hiring, while for Mexican companies that figure stands at 65%.
7
66% of Costa Rican companies and 61% Colombian companies report the same.
8
A 2021 OECD study found that the lack of quality jobs is a key driver of social dissatisfaction in the region, and calls for an ambitious regional agenda to increase innovation and capacity development through education and skills acquisition to tackle this challenge.
9
Another factor that will drive the need to reduce the skill gap in the region is the developing trend of nearshoring in the region. Geopolitical and supply chain considerations are influencing companies, particularly in the United States, to move their operation to locations closer to their markets, that require less energy for transportation and have better political alignment. In this context, Latin America is becoming one of the most attractive options for relocation and several countries in the region are competing for these new sources of employment and investment.
10
Greater participation in global value chains results in transfer of technology and knowledge and more job opportunities, and Latin America is predicted to increase exports in the auto industry, textiles, pharmaceuticals and renewable energy, to name a few.
11
However, in order to take advantage of this opportunity, there is a need for technologically advanced workers who can adequately address the demands of these higher-skill jobs. This need will drive an increased demand for greater technical expertise in these areas as well as improved language capabilities, creating an even greater urgency to close the Latin American skills gap.
This represents an unmatched growth opportunity for the sector in the region. Fifty-five per cent of Latin American adults who engage in open or distance education have found it a useful tool to improve their job performance and career prospects.
12
As part of their innovative offerings, edtech companies ensure instruction is aligned with the needs of each student, allowing them to customize their learning experience and adjust the pace to accelerate their program of study or take additional time to ensure mastery.
13
These offerings also reduce the cost of education by reducing reliance on manual resources, making updates to learning materials simple, and introducing automation.
14
A highly competitive job market further encourages students of all ages to further develop various competencies, creating a demand for educational technology, and a demand for institutions to digitally transform.
15
Edtech uptake among young adults in particular is growing at a faster pace in Latin America than in other regions in the world.
In a recent survey conducted by Economist Impact, we found that 86% of Brazilian youth had participated in online education or courses to improve their professional skills compared with 78% of young people in India and 74% in the US.
16
Value of knowledge: assessing edtech investments
In response to this growing demand, edtechs dedicated to workforce upskilling have seen the most expansion in the region. Workforce and management systems, which are considered corporate learning ventures, comprise almost half the edtech startups founded in Latin America (See Graph 1). Workforce upskilling-focused edtechs include firms such as Coderhouse, a startup that provides a platform for LatAm professionals to take live, online cohort-based courses in topics such as data, coding, design and marketing. The classes are offered in small groups led by instructors and teaching assistants, and the curriculum is designed through partnerships with top companies. The courses are offered at an accessible price point per course.
17
Similarly, Bedu, a Mexican venture, provides technical courses designed to help employees build practical skills, with a focus on upskilling to boost salaries.
18A study looking at a sample cohort of edtech ventures in the region also found that workforce-focused edtechs attract the majority of start-up funding, indicating an increasing focus on ventures oriented to learners in the workforce.
19
Investments in workforce and upskilling-focused edtechs further increased as the pandemic compelled companies to rapidly scale. In 2021 alone LatAm raised 46% of the total investment amount the region had captured over the previous decade. It experienced an influx of venture capital (VC) investment totaling sixfold the amount that it received in 2020, equal to US$1bn.
20
(see Graph 2)
Funding for Latin American Edtechs exploded in 2021
VC funding for LatAm Edtech ventures 2011-21
21Comparing against global markets, in both Europe and Latin America workforce solutions are the most relevant edtech sectors receiving sizable investments. A breakdown of VC investments in Europe shows that corporate learning takes the biggest share (35%). Although Latin America lags in terms of funding value, its investments have a similar distribution.
22
Over half (55%) of private funding in LatAm edtechs in the past five years has gone into the workforce sector.
23
Even though Latin America’s edtech investments are behind those of global markets, its future revenue is set to grow. Latin America is the fourth-largest edtech market in the world—behind North America, Western Europe and Asia in terms of revenue—and its e-learning market is expected to generate revenue of over US$3bn by 2023.
24
Globally, the edtech market is growing at a rate of 16.3% and is set to reach US$404bn in total global expenditure, suggesting an overall trend toward growth.
25
A decade of development in edtech in the LatAm region has helped the sector expand dramatically in the past 12 months. The Latin American edtech ecosystem has grown to encompass more than 1,500 companies.
26
Brazil represents over 50% of all edtech VC funding in this period. Mexico follows at 19%, then Peru, Argentina, Colombia and Chile each capture 6-8% of funding.
27
(See Graph 3)However, as we pointed out in our recent research on tech start-ups, there are only 15 start-ups in Latin America that are valued at more than US$1m, making up only 0.5% of the region’s start-up investment.
28
Not all opportunities in edtech will have the capacity to scale internationally, but opportunities that address regional educational needs will capture a significant share of the market, and present meaningful opportunities to capitalize on the overall growth potential.
Grading LatAm market readiness
To understand the potential of edtech ventures, investors should consider the opportunities that will fulfill the most prescient need in the region. While covid-19 sparked a demand for all types of digital educational experiences, investors’ interest in ventures that support workforce upskilling is sustained as the pandemic subsides. An analysis of the population, education levels, skill gaps and current use of education tools online suggests that there is a large untapped market for workforce development solutions that will generate an enduring demand for these applications in the near future (see Table 1).
A sampling of Latin American countries reflects a sizable working population and growing employment rates. Twenty-four percent of jobs will face a high risk of automation, and an additional 35% of jobs in Latin America are likely to experience significant changes in the tasks that workers carry out daily, so a significant portion of the working population could feasibly benefit from some form of upskilling or reskilling.
29
Middling availability of skilled labor in countries like Brazil and Ecuador and a lack of quality labor in countries like Peru further indicate the need for skill building across industries. On the positive side, high literacy levels across the region and overall comfort using the internet for education purposes suggest that Latin Americans have the capacity to adopt edtech innovations into their routines. For example, 42% of the population in Mexico and 34% in Colombia have taken an online course. These data point to an environment that is opportune for workforce edtechs in the short term. The need to bridge the regional skill gap, coupled with the initial uptake and spending on online education ventures in the past few years demonstrates the market potential for edtech solutions.The heavy reliance edtechs have on technology is a limiting factor, but is more immediately pressing in the case of K-12 edtechs, the second-most prevalent edtech venture type. Institutional hurdles to adoption and reliance on household access to technology make these ventures more challenging compared with upskilling projects. Budgets, bureaucracy and the need for collaboration across numerous stakeholders (including educational institutions, companies, government, regulatory bodies, parents and students) pose implementation and institutional challenges in the K-12 space, and many institutions are not yet mature enough to successfully incorporate remote and digital content.
31
Digital readiness poses additional hurdles. Though 74% of Latin Americans use the internet, indicating high internet penetration, questions about affordability, connectivity and readiness persist
32
(see Graph 4). According to the latest edition of Economist Impact’s Inclusive Internet Index, the region’s internet is highly relevant and affordable, but there are persistent gaps in availability and digital readiness. For example, more than six out of ten households with their per-head income in the lower quintile of income distribution do not have access to the fixed high‑speed broadband internet connection needed to support remote working and studying.
33
To this end, comparatively, workforce upskilling remains the more viable edtech venture type in the short term.Conclusion
Corporate market and upskilling has been the primary destination for investment in Latin America and remains a favorable opportunity, particularly in the short term. Immediate demand for skilled labor and increasing competition propel the market, creating current and ongoing opportunities. Workforce education globally is projected to have a growth rate of 3.9%, and investments are projected to increase from US$396bn in 2019 to US$498bn in 2025.
34
Since Latin America typically mirrors global edtech trends, albeit at a smaller scale, the sector's prospects in this region look optimistic for the future.1

https://privatebank.jpmorgan.com/gl/en/insights/living/recognizing-email-threats-and-social-engineering,"Hackers take advantage of our trust and natural willingness to be helpful by employing social engineering techniques to break our usual cybersecurity practices. Fraudsters can trick you into performing actions or divulging confidential information via email, phone calls, social media and other interactions, which could lead to a compromise of your data or assets.Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.
Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.In the past five years, the sophistication of tactics used to commit fraud has significantly evolved. Historically, fraudsters have hacked into email accounts and attempted to guess online banking passwords. Recently, attempts have included actions such as porting victims’ mobile phone numbers to cellular devices the fraudsters control, and gaining entry into computers via remote access scams, which exposes all of a victim’s confidential data, not just banking details. In 2022, cyber criminals are now focusing on cryptocurrency transactions, as recovery of crypto assets is incredibly difficult once funds are sent via that platform.
Recognize the types of social engineering email threats
Email phishing:
Fraudsters attempt to trick individuals into replying to or clicking a link in an email that may appear to be legitimate.
Phishing
emails can contain malicious software (malware) or attempts to convince the recipient to divulge sensitive information such as confidential data or account credentials.
Spear phishing
, a more targeted form of phishing, can use information collected online or via social media to make the email, and request within it, appear more credible.
Email spoofing:
Fraudsters mimic or
spoof
an email to convince targets that the email they are receiving is from a known and trusted source. This can be done by modifying the header in a malicious email to pose as a trusted sender — for example,
@deancoLLC.com
can appear similar to a known vendor
@cleancoLLC.com
. Similarly, a fraudster can copy a logo from a known company to trick their target into thinking it’s a credible email.
Email account compromise:
Fraudsters use a victim’s legitimate username and password to gain access to his account to send, receive and view their target’s email. Through an
email account compromise
, they are looking to capture information such as details on upcoming financial transactions or to manipulate a wire transfer into their account.
Voice phishing:
Fraudsters spoof or mask the caller ID to make the call appear it is coming from a known or legitimate contact to make the call appear authentic. Through vishing they will voice phish individuals into providing their personal or financial information.
Text phishing:
Fraudsters spoof or mask the phone number of the sender to make the message appear it is coming from a known or legitimate contact to make the call appear authentic. Through SMiShing they will phish individuals using SMS text messages to trick individuals to click on a link or call the phone number provide and disclose personal or financial information.For individuals
Recognize phishing email warning signs, such as poor grammar and spelling, urgent language, hyperlinks or attachments, fake logos, a vague email address and no or vague contact information.
Do not assume a request is genuine just because the requester knows information about you or your company.
Do not call unknown numbers. Always use the telephone numbers that appear on your statement or on the company’s website.
Confirm the identity of the requester via an alternate, verified method, and check the email address: scammers often use spoofed email addresses to send what seem to be legitimate requests.
Be cautious of clicking on any links or attachments sent to you in emails or text messages.
Limit the information you post on social media. Every account is a venue for a hacker to gain intelligence on you.
Create strong and complex passwords, change them frequently and never share them. Leverage multi-factor authentication for additional security.
Update operating systems and anti-virus software on computers and mobile devices to the latest versions, as soon as they become available.
Encrypt sensitive information such as account numbers, tax information or other personal information before emailing it.For businesses
Educate your employees about threats in the fraud landscape and how they can mitigate risk. Consider implementing a fraud awareness education program.
Implement a social media policy for employees to ensure critical information about staff with privileged responsibilities and their roles is not available to the public.
Employ additional spam reduction solutions or filters, if needed, to help reduce the risk of malicious emails reaching employees’ inboxes.
Implement the email authentication protocols Sender Policy Framework (SPF), Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM) and Domain-based Message Authentications, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) to greatly enhance the authenticity of the emails your organization sends and receives.
Use a proxy internet filtering service to help block employees from visiting potentially malicious web pages and links found in spam email.If you believe you have been targeted by a fraud scheme or your login credentials have been compromised, contact J.P.

Market update
Everything, everywhere, all at once
All businesses go through times of struggle. When it’s banks, it feels a whole lot worse.
The near-simultaneous
collapse of Silicon Valley Bank
, Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank last week challenged confidence in the financial system. The swift and coordinated move on Sunday night by the FDIC, Federal Reserve and Treasury to reassure bank depositors was a powerful effort to instill calm. Nonetheless, investors didn’t find much reprieve until the Swiss National Bank and a consortium of U.S. banks stepped in to support Credit Suisse and First Republic, respectively, later in the week.
The swings in markets have been eye-watering: Each day this week has seen 2-year Treasury yields whipsaw more than 20 basis points (bps) in either direction, and bond volatility spiked to the highest it’s been since the Global Financial Crisis. Banks saw their worst day since March 2020 on Monday, while tech is having its best week since November.
Somehow, through everything, everywhere, all at once, the S&P 500 is heading into Friday
+2.6%
higher on the week.
It’s unlikely this all will be resolved this week, or even this month. We wouldn’t be surprised to see more aftershocks. For now, we focus on what we know.
Yesterday marked one year since the Fed’s first rate hike, and since then, it’s increased its policy rate by 450 bps—the most aggressive tightening cycle we’ve seen in decades. The banking turmoil seems like the latest symptom of this historic policy tightening.
We expected higher rates to have consequences, and to tilt us into a recession this year. Rate hikes are meant to slow growth and inflation, and they leave damage along the way. For months, different parts of the economy have corrected in the face of these challenges (housing, manufacturing and tech have all gone through their own reckonings over the last year), and now the banking sector is the latest to stumble.
Granted we didn’t expect three regional banks to fail, and it seems the breakdown from higher rates is happening faster than we expected.
Some good news: It’s clear that policymakers are taking the risks seriously.
The contagion, wealth destruction and job loss experienced during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) are etched into memory. We have confidence that policymakers developed a powerful playbook 15 years ago and are deploying it more rapidly this time around. The quick and sweeping moves from U.S. and Swiss authorities to support banks over the last few days demonstrate this commitment.
What’s more, the banking sector as a whole is in a different place today. The largest and systematically important banks are more regulated, tend to have diversified deposits, maintain fortress balance sheets, and as a result, are much better capitalized now. That’s not to say there won’t be further stress, but it does make comparisons to 2008 an incomplete analogy.As for what’s next, focus is firmly on how the Fed navigates these new stresses at its policy meeting next week.
Central bankers are now tasked with balancing both the fight against inflation and the need for financial stability. A properly functioning banking system is needed to transmit its own policy.
Before this week’s turmoil, it seemed like the Fed might need to keep pressing on the brake. It was only a week ago that Chair Powell suggested the pace of rate hikes could accelerate to beat down sticky inflation.
But now, this latest shock means the cost of credit is higher and lending standards are tighter, making the decision to borrow, invest and spend more complicated. These dynamics ought to slow growth and inflation, and potentially accelerate the path to recession. As a result, we’re likely now in the final stretch of the Fed’s rate hike process. Looking ahead to its policy meeting next week, markets are split between whether we’ll see a final 25-basis-point hike, or none at all.
March madness, indeed.Investment considerations
Steady hands prevail
Investors will continue to question the path forward, with more market swings ahead—but in the meantime, we believe the best course of action is to stay balanced, focus on the facts, and be prudent.
To us, this means a few things:
1) Not taking big swings
When it comes to times like these, steady hands prevail—and that means not overreaching for risk. That’s why we’re more closely tracking our benchmark in the core portfolios we manage, and focusing on high-quality investments rather than speculating.
2) Getting defensive, especially with bonds
The quick collapse in yields over the last week demonstrates why bonds are an essential part of a diversified portfolio. While markets may still be searching for calm, we expect rates to finish the year even lower as recession takes hold, or future stresses reveal themselves. This means bonds can offer essential protection.
The Great Financial Crisis (GFC), for instance, was no exception: A portfolio invested 100% in global stocks at the peak of the market before the crash would have seen steep losses of ~60%. Meanwhile, a portfolio invested in 40% global stocks and 60% global bonds would have suffered losses half as great—and only taken half the time to recover.3) Resisting the temptation to hit “sell”
Market timing can be a dangerous habit, and herd-following behavior during downturns or bubbles can lead to losses. History shows that the best days and the worst days for the market tend to cluster together: Over the last 20 years, seven of the 10 best days occurred within just about two weeks of the 10 worst days.
Missing those best days can have dramatic consequences. For instance, over that same 20-year period, the S&P 500 saw a 10% annual return. But if an investor missed just the 10 best days, that return would have been nearly cut in half.Navigating these times can be challenging, but steady hands prevail.

Returns are based on the S&P 500 Total Return Index.  It states that if the investor stayed invested from February 2003 through February 2023, then the investor would have made 10.27% in annualized return. If the investor missed the 10 best days of the S&P 500, then the annualized return of staying invested for the rest of the time would have become 6.05%. If the investor missed the 20 best days of the S&P 500, then the annualized return of staying invested for the rest of the time would have become 3.37%.  If the investor missed the 30 best days of the S&P 500, then the annualized return of staying invested for the rest of the time would have become 1.22%.

Equity volatility has notably cooled over recent weeks. The VIX Index, which measures implied volatility of US equities, is at lows not seen since the end of summer. The S&P 500 is now up over 10% from early October lows, breaching the 4,000 mark for the first time in two months. Meanwhile, bonds remained volatile – the short-term treasury yields are still approaching cycle highs as longer-term yields have fallen from their peak. The MOVE Index, which measures implied rates volatility, persists at historically elevated levels.
The recent optimism in risk assets can be attributed to a number of factors. Signs from both U.S. CPI and PPI that inflation might be peaking, as well as hints from the FOMC minutes that the Fed may execute a slower pace of rate hikes from here, both suggest that we may be approaching the end of the policy tightening cycle. A rate hike step down from 75bps to 50bps in December is now widely expected by the market. Upside surprises to earnings reports and healthy consumption data also helped the risk sentiment.
On the FX front, we’ve now seen the largest 10-day selloff in the USD going back to 2000 – aside from a brief period in the extreme volatility of 2008-2009. Historically, when the dollar valuation screens as rich as it was in early November, the dollar typically falls about 6-7% over the next 12-months, on average. In other words, we just got the mean reversion we typically get in a year in two weeks. Is the turn in the dollar already here? Read on for our view.
Strategy Question: Is the U.S. dollar finally turning?
Before the recent weakness, the dollar had been having its best year since the 1970s. This matters for investors; currency exposure could generate substantial outperformance or underperformance, depending on which way it swings, and multinational corporate earnings are likewise impacted.Over recent weeks the USD has been beginning to screen expensive across all of the valuation frameworks we employ – historical averages, rate differentials, global growth dynamics. Historically, the dollar would weaken from such stretched valuation levels within a 12-month horizon. Against that backdrop, our view on the broad USD has been that Dollar strength will likely recede over the medium-term. However, that “mean reversion” process would require some catalysts to really begin.To get a sense of how the U.S. dollar might move, we often rely on the “smile” framework, which holds that the greenback typically strengthens when:
The global economy is weak and investor risk appetite turns negative (the left-hand side)
When the U.S. economy outperforms the rest of the world and focus turns to Fed rate hikes (the right-hand side)
On the other hand, the dollar tends to weaken once the Fed pivots back towards more accommodative policy, and the rest of the world grows in tandem.That framework has held true this year — the dollar has been very strong against the backdrop of US economic outperformance and higher USD interest rates. From here, to see the dollar turn we need to see:
Evidence that inflation is cooling in the U.S., which gives the Fed room to pause from its ultra-hawkish stance
Global growth expectations stabilize, and ideally, improve (particularly from China and Europe)
Over the past weeks, we’ve seen progress on both fronts. The softer-than-expected U.S. CPI report was a clear start. While one or two data points do not make a trend, it helps to make the case for the Fed to step down its pace of rate hikes, it signals that the end of the hiking cycle is getting closer rather than farther away, and it removes some degree of uncertainty regarding the trajectory of U.S. rates. In other words, U.S. rate vol – one of the key forces supporting the USD this year – could be peaking. On economic growth, tail risks in Europe have diminished in the near-term with the fall in natural gas prices from their peak.
That said, macro uncertainty is still high and recession risks remain elevated,  particularly outside of the U.S. Therefore,
we aren’t yet waving the flag for the dollar’s turn—but we are paying close attention. That continues to leave us with a preference for U.S. over international assets.
For investors, it’s a dimmer-dial, not an on-off switch
While we think we are still a bit of a way away from a genuine turn in the dollar, the two catalysts for dollar weakness (stabilizing inflation and global growth) are likely not too far on the horizon. With that in mind,
it may make sense to take profits on some investments that have benefitted from this year’s historical rally in the greenback.
Positioning for a turn in the dollar generally happens in two stages: First, currencies and precious metals that tend to provide lower growth and yield (like the Japanese yen and Swiss franc, and gold) tend to recover. And later, when there are full-on early cycle dynamics, higher-growth-oriented currencies (like emerging markets) rally. We think investors should start thinking about that first stage.
But remember, investing through cycles is about using dimmers and dials as the environment shifts. It’s not ideal for your portfolio to have an on-off switch.
Over the longer term, a strategic allocation decision across global asset markets today should also carefully consider the impact of currency movements, as it will be a meaningful component of future returns. USD-based investors, in particular, could be positioned to reap the tailwinds from ex-U.S. exposure as the dollar reverts to more average valuation metrics.All market and economic data as of November 24, 2022 and sourced from Bloomberg Finance L.P. and FactSet unless otherwise stated.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Financial planning isn’t just about managing your assets. It’s the key to having a life of meaning, purpose and impactIn one way or another, most wealthy individuals eventually ask themselves: How can money, wealth and strategic financial decisions support my having a life of meaning, purpose and impact? Our next gen clients are no exception.
Finding the right answer is a process unique to the individual posing the question. As a starting point, we offer this blueprint, which is based both on our nearly two centuries of work with clients who have significant fortunes and the latest research on money and meaning.
Can having wealth maximize your happiness?
Let’s start with the science. One of the best books from the field of behavioral science explains how the way we spend money has a more measurable impact on our happiness and contentment than how much money we have.
1
Several key takeaways should be relevant to the next generation of wealth:
1. Buy experiences
This may be common knowledge, but it’s a deep truth worth repeating: We get more value from experiences than things. A trip with family, an intensive language course, contributing time and resources to benefit others.
Why? In short: We get used to the things we have. We adapt to our surroundings and revert back to what we think of as normal. In this way, our new car quickly becomes our old car.
In sharp contrast, experiences add value to our lives in many stages:
First, we anticipate the experience
Then we engage in the experience
Afterward, we reflect upon, reminisce, retell and expand the experience into the future
The story of that one touchdown you scored in high school eventually becomes your glorious struggle for a world championship… in the snow, uphill, both ways.
2. Make it a treat
Consider buying the things—and experiences—you love a little less often.
When we consume all the time, whenever we want, we tend to appreciate it less. The infrequency of an indulgence makes it more special and gives us greater joy.
This is especially good advice if you’re wealthy. One Belgian study showed that people with more money were less likely to appreciate small but beautiful things in life, such as a walk on a mountain trail.
This guidance doesn’t mean you should deny or deprive yourself. Rather, noticing your patterns (a really fancy and delicious coffee every day? A monthly trip to Paris?) and adjusting the frequency can increase the pleasure they provide each time.
3. Buy time
Time may be our most precious resource. So one of the most important gifts your financial resources might buy you is time to focus on what matters most.
For example, you might outsource certain tasks, employ new technologies or reprioritize your commitments. There are countless ways to gift yourself more time. The key is to figure out how you really want to spend it.
As behavioral science has shown
,
“When people focus on their time rather than their money, they act like scientists of happiness, choosing activities that promote their well-being.”
2
4. Invest in others
Spending money on others provides more happiness than spending on ourselves.
Surveys, field experiments and collected research all have found: “The amount of money [people] spent on themselves was unrelated to their overall happiness. What did predict happiness? The amount of money they gave away. The more they invested in others, the happier they were.”
3
Investing in others might take the form of gifts to family,
philanthropic donations
, supporting entrepreneurs and artists, or simply buying someone’s coffee. Whatever the method, don’t discount the impact that thinking of others can have on yourself.
Does having wealth lead to contentment?
It is often said that wealth used strategically can provide “funded contentment.”
4
It’s an interesting perspective to add to how we think about money and meaning, happiness and success.
There are many sources of contentment. It’s not just a comfy hammock, a cool drink and nice sunset… though that does sound lovely. Contentment is many things to many people. Security, opportunity, legacy, impact, philanthropy, influence. There is no right nor wrong answer.
To help define it for yourself, consider self-determination theory. This is the concept that we get happiness, meaning, satisfaction (i.e., contentment) from three sources:
Community
—We are social creatures and need to connect with others (to influence and/or be influenced by them) to feel that we belong
Competence
—We need to feel like we know what we’re doing. That we’re masters of something, or are learning or teaching, or, in short, are using our minds
Control
—We need to be in control—not over others, but over our own selves. To have autonomy, agency, influence on what we do and what we create
How can you spend your time, money and resources to satisfy these very fundamental needs?
For example, many next gen clients get value beyond their financial returns with sustainable investing.  We’ve seen them get a sense of community through investments in important projects that aim to address needs of the whole world. They experience competence through learning about and developing new and needed techniques and technologies. And they express control by taking on something of their own and supporting efforts—though sometimes far off and hard to measure—that are likely to be vast and deep.
Finding wealth strategies that might do the same for you isn’t easy. But the search is worth the effort. And, of course, we’re here to help you discover how your wealth can support your deeper sense of purpose and meaning, and then build and execute a plan to bring those things to life.
What does meaningful mean to you?
What are your ambitions, values and goals? And how can you wisely use your wealth to support what we often call a life portfolio?
What methods have your peers, parents, colleagues, children and others you know found to be successful ways to use money to create deeper meaning?
We know from experience—and from what the science tells us, too—how impactful it can be to consider the intention of your wealth.

Cross Asset Strategy
Fed statements dominated market moves this week. Equities started the week shedding some of their recent gains following comments by New York Fed President John Williams and St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard that the fight against inflation could “last into 2024”.  Sentiment was turned around by Chair Powell’s speech on Wednesday, which drove a 3% rally in the S&P 500 and a 15bps decline in 10-year treasury yields.
For the most part, Chair Powell’s remarks were not too different from his communications at the November FOMC meeting. The message is that the pace of policy tightening will likely moderate as soon as December (a 75 to 50bps stepdown was fully priced in before the speech); the fight against inflation is not over yet; and the Fed needs to see labor market demand cooling substantially before changing its policy stance. The optimism likely came from the fact that he did not push back on the easing in financial conditions driven by a risk asset rally and lower interest rates. Since the November FOMC, the S&P 500 climbed ~10% and the 10-year yield dropped ~50bps. As shown in the below chart, the tightening in financial conditions notably reversed, running the risk of encouraging future growth and pushing inflation higher. In our view, it could increase the odds of a higher terminal Fed funds rate or a terminal rate that stays high for longer. Risk assets could see further challenges from here. In this environment, core bonds are still our favored way to earn reliable income, add downside protection in portfolio and potentially benefit from capital appreciation.Strategy Question: what’s our take on the recent market drivers?
Upside surprise in economic data across the U.S. and Europe
U.S. consumers turned out to be more resilient than expected. The positive 1.3% month-over-month change in October retail sales was the largest monthly gain in eight months. With inflation much more muted in October, that means real retail sales were firmly positive. While we expect tightening financial conditions to ultimately weigh on consumer spending, the lags could be longer than expected.In Europe, following better than expected Q3 GDP numbers, the November flash composite PMI again beat expectations (47.8 vs. 47.0 consensus, 47.3 prior). Despite that, the data still pointed to a continued contraction in the region, with manufacturing at 47.3 (vs. 46.0 consensus) and services at 48.6 (vs. 48.0 consensus), the prints could imply a shallower downturn in the region. This trend of stronger-than-anticipated European data can also be seen in the economic surprise indicator, as shown in the below chart.In the U.S., the bright spot in the PMI release came in the form of easing price pressures, as firms’ input costs rose at the slowest rate since December 2020, and firms raised their selling prices at the slowest rate in nearly two years. This reaffirms our view that U.S. inflation could trend down from here following the softer than expected CPI and PPI data in October.The upside surprises in data were welcomed by the market. However, the loss in growth momentum in both regions is clear. In the U.S., new orders fell at the fastest pace since May 2020, and with the exception of the onset of the pandemic, the decrease in total new sales was one of the sharpest since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). As for Europe, activities are broadly in contraction and high uncertainty reigns supreme as the war persists. We continue to believe that Europe is headed for a recession this winter. Under this backdrop, it’s unlikely that risk assets are “all clear” from here.
Updates in Covid measures in China
In China, easing of the policy appears to be more fully underway. At the November 29 press conference the National Health Commission (NHC) stated that Omicron and its sub-variants have asignificantly lower mortality rate, and hence the threat to the population is also meaningfully lower. The NHC followed on by encouraging the elderly population to get vaccinated. The press conference came two weeks after 20 new measures for tackling COVID were announced, which already marked a shift towards an approach that balances social and economic considerations against the cost of infection. The NHC explained that close contacts would no longer be traced, to remove a costly practice.
There is clearly now more visibility, and confidence, that a fuller and more sustainable reopening would be feasible. Over the last few days, in several cities, including Guangzhou, mobility restrictions and PCR tests have been further relaxed.
From an economic perspective, an easing of policywill likely put a floor on various mobility metrics this winter. At the same time, given rising cases, some degree of mobility and testing rules could remain in place until the current wave passes. As such, Q4 2022 to Q1 2023 could still see weaker economic activity growth. When thinking about the consumption recovery, we need to take into consideration the impact of the housing downturn and the global economic slowdown. Balancing these factors (which will likely impact consumer income) versus the impact of re-opening (which may lift sentiment), we have penciled in a 0.3ppt GDP boost for 2023. We see a fuller recovery in 2024 (around 1ppt). An upside risk to our base case (3.3% GDP for 2023, and 4.9% for 2024
1
) will be possible if we see further monetary and fiscal easing in the December Central Economic Work Conference and the NPC in March.
A sell-off in commodities
Energy commodities sold off over the past weeks. Drivers of the tumble came from both supply and demand factors. On supply, the market has been waiting with anticipation to see how Russia will react to the European price cap that will be announced before December 5th. On this point it appears markets are losing faith on an end to material OPEC+ production cuts, with the realization that price caps proposed at $60-65/bbl for Russian oil (which typically trade at a $22/bbl discount to Brent) could be largely a non-event at the current price levels. Elsewhere, the Biden administration granted Chevron a license to resume oil production in Venezuela after sanctions halted all drilling activity almost three years ago, which could lead to an increase in shipments to 1M barrels of crude by late December. On the demand side, dampened expectations for a smooth reopening in China and fear of ever higher terminal Fed rates seem to have also overwhelmed the bulls for now.
This has created a significant divergence between the price of crude, which has meaningfully pulled back, and energy equities, which are hovering near their highs. Over the last 20 years, this divergence usually implies an unattractive risk reward profile in the sector. Over the medium term, rising recession risks in the U.S. and Europe would be a dampener on oil demand, which could bring further downside risks to energy equities. Given the sector has outperformed the S&P 500 by 72% year-to-date,
we favor profit taking of energy equities into yearend at current levels

https://privatebank.jpmorgan.com/gl/en/insights/investing/why-you-want-to-explore-chinese-and-european-equities-now,"Investment StrategyWhy you want to explore Chinese and European equities nowauthors:- Madison Fallerpublished Date:- Mar 21, 2023Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.
Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.After a decade of U.S. stock dominance, prospects look brighter in non-U.S. markets.As markets churn—and with global bank stocks especially hard hit in the wake of the biggest U.S. bank collapse since 2008—it’s not easy to see clearly ahead. Countervailing forces will impact the prospects for growth and inflation, and in turn the potential for investment returns in 2023.
When we step back from the day-to-day market volatility, one theme continues to resonate: The outlook for economic growth outside the United States is brighter than seemed possible just six months ago. China is quickly reopening post-COVID. The euro area economy avoided a recession this winter thanks to a resilient energy sector.
Yet, your portfolio, like many investor portfolios, may be overloaded with U.S. stocks after a decade of outpacing their foreign counterparts.
We think it’s a good time to look beyond U.S. markets and focus in particular on Chinese and European equities. Here, we explore five reasons (home country bias, stronger economic growth, higher profits, better valuations, secular trends) why you may want to broaden your investment horizon this year.
Beware of home country bias
Many investors stick to their home countries in making investment decisions. For example, the U.S. equity market accounts for more than half of the global stock market, yet nearly three-fourths of the entire U.S. equity market is owned by Americans.
Home country bias may have proven helpful to U.S. investors during the past decade, as the U.S. stock market was propelled higher by the growth of mega-cap tech companies. However, such a bias may be problematic if U.S. stocks were to underperform. Looking ahead, we see several reasons why U.S. stocks might lag their global peers this year.
Look for greener growth pastures
For much of 2022, Beijing’s zero-COVID policy kept China under lockdown. Europe, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, faced an energy crisis and a seemingly inevitable recession. But by the end of the year, dynamics for both regions had dramatically shifted.
China has reopened much faster than expected, and economic activity is recovering across sectors. In February, manufacturing activity expanded at its fastest pace in a decade. We believe consumers will continue to fuel growth as they start to draw on excess savings amassed under lockdown. Even the long-troubled property sector shows signs of hitting bottom. Finally, the Chinese government has made it clear that it will prioritize pro-growth policies.
In Europe, a determined effort to rebuild natural gas reserves, coupled with a mild winter, helped natural gas prices fall by over 80%, back to pre-war levels. Lower energy prices have delivered a critical boost to the euro area economy.
Of course, the coast isn’t perfectly clear. Inflation remains high in the euro area, and the European Central Bank (ECB) is still on the offensive, having recently raised the policy rate by 50 basis points (bps). Lending standards may tighten and act to slow growth as the recent bank shock reverberates globally.
Critically, though, Europe’s banks are generally on sound footing. Deposit bases are more retail-based (i.e., stickier) than their U.S. counterparts. More stringent regulations enacted in the wake of the financial crisis and eurozone sovereign debt crisis strengthened capital ratios. And finally, European banks’ riskier securities portfolios tend to be smaller than their U.S. peers.Uncover more resilient corporate earnings
Better growth should boost sales for Chinese and European companies, potentially leading to higher corporate profits.
Expectations for corporate profits in China only recent hit a bottom, and they have started to shift higher as companies benefit from reopening.
In Europe, corporate profits have already moved higher. Many banks reported strong earnings last quarter, boosted by higher interest rates after over a decade of negative interest rates. Lower gas prices bolstered industrial companies, energy companies are increasing their capital spending, and luxury brands seem to be going from strength to strength.
Continued scrutiny of the banking sector may add some pressure to profits (financials make up 17% of the European stock market). But European companies should increasingly benefit from China’s rapid reopening: While Asia accounted for only ~11% of Stoxx Europe 600 revenues in 2010, the region now represents more than 20%. That could be a boon for luxury companies in particular.Beyond the sell-off
U.S. stocks, particularly mega-cap tech names, still trade at stretched valuations. At the same time, European and Chinese stocks offer more attractive price-earnings multiples. Chinese and European stocks have both sold off in recent weeks, offering a potentially attractive entry point.Buy tomorrow’s trends today
China and Europe both may play critical roles in shaping some of the most powerful trends driving the global economy in the coming years, including:
Deglobalization
Supply-chain resiliency
Energy and food security
Decarbonization
The European Union looks poised to embark on several new initiatives to bolster the energy transition. As policymakers and companies focus on decarbonization and energy security, Europe’s stock market could benefit from its relatively high weighting to the industrials, materials and energy sectors compared to the U.S. market.
At their annual “Two Sessions” conference in March, Chinese policymakers discussed a broad economic agenda. They emphasized the need for measures to develop high-end manufacturing. and “whole nation” efforts to achieve technological self-reliance.
Weighing all risks and rewards
Banking sector turmoil and today’s geopolitics—including war in Ukraine and ongoing tensions between the United States and China—present a risk for all investors. The prospect of slowing growth and sticky inflation also challenges central bankers across the global economy. We may well see rising market volatility as investors weigh these ongoing risks.
If volatility does increase, we believe individual stock selection (also known as active management) will be even more essential to identify high-quality companies able to ride out the market storms, as well as those that offer access to future growth trends. Stock benchmarks in Europe and China are also less concentrated than large-cap U.S. indices, giving active managers a better chance to outperform the index.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Bank failures have rattled investors, but don’t let a bad month (or even year) derail your long-term financial plansMarkets have been turbulent since March roared in, rattling investors in two different ways. First was the uncertainty driving the inflation debate: Was the economy still overheating, or nearing recession? Already shaken, stock markets were then hit by two rapid bank failures. Investors worried about whether worse might lie ahead. Was the economy heading to the brink of another financial crisis?
Intervention by regulators and the Federal Reserve (Fed) calmed markets somewhat, as of the time of writing 72 hours later. Still, the most substantial bank failures since 2008 have many investors on edge. We understand—the global financial crisis may be 15 years behind us, but many people were scarred by the contagion, wealth destruction and job losses that were its hallmarks.
We expect bad months—even bad years. In one of its most volatile years, the market plunged over 40%. Another year, stocks soared 60%. Yet a blended stock-bond portfolio hasn’t suffered a negative return over any five-year rolling period.
1
Further, in an average year, the stock market sees a close to 15% peak-to-trough decline. Currently, the year-to-date drawdown is 8%. While drawdowns are never comfortable, what we are seeing in markets is, at the surface, normal.
So while we look at the dynamics currently in play and consider what they might mean for you, keep that long-term perspective in mind.
Here are our three key takeaways.
Takeaway #1: Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank were different
The crises at Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and then Signature Bank ignited in investors a fear of contagion—that many other regional banks could follow.
But SVB and Signature Bank were different. They had unusually high concentrations of large deposits—far above the $250,000 insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). And in the case of SVB, almost all the depositors were venture funds and the businesses they backed.
As Chairman of Market and Investment Strategy Michael Cembalest explained in his
Eye on the Market
and again last week, SVB sourced less than 10% of its deposits from retail clients, who are viewed as “stickier,” meaning far less likely to move their money than corporate or institutional depositors.
SVB also had a large book of securities investments that lost value this past year as the Fed raised rates, and the value of the bank’s long-term bonds declined.The Fed, the FDIC and Treasury took actions to make all depositors whole and provide liquidity to the banking system. Those lending facilities ought to help avoid some of the worst-case scenarios.
Banks will probably be more conservative with their lending practices from here. That could lead banks to pull back the amount of credit they provide to small and medium-size businesses, which could restrain economic growth. At the same time, conservative lending practices can act like a Fed rate hike, “tightening” money policy. That might persuade the Fed to opt for a less aggressive path for interest rates.
Takeaway #2: The tech recession is here. That means it’s time to look for opportunity
SVB’s other distinguishing factor is that deposits were highly concentrated in the technology and healthcare/life sciences spaces. Signature Bank, for its part, had a focus on the crypto sector. In the case of SVB, in excess of one-third of its deposit base was from early-stage tech and healthcare companies.
Such companies are often (as yet) unprofitable, speculative and digitally enabled. They soared during lockdowns, when lives moved online and interest rates were extremely low. But now, under the opposite conditions (public life reopening, the quickest rate hikes in a generation), investors are far less enthusiastic, capital markets have largely been closed to them, and fundraising has become difficult. Their very viability was at stake, as they burned cash without fresh fund inflows.
As noted, we don’t see this scenario at other regional banks. And that leads us to a second key point: SVB is in many ways the latest (and largest) example of the tech recession that has been unfolding over the last six months.
According to tracking from layoffs.fyi, 481 tech companies announced headcount reductions just this year. But there are some tentative signs that the tech layoff wave may have crested. As the chart shows, the number of tech employees laid off seems to have peaked in January.It has been a rough stretch for the technology complex in general, but it may be time for investors to start to sort through the wreckage. We expect to see opportunities in businesses with leaner cost structures and sustainable business models that may be valued at a discount.
Takeaway #3: The latest jobs report was not too hot and not too cold
The irony of the SVB failure is that it occurred in the same day that investors got a “goldilocks” jobs report for the month of February.
The U.S. economy added 311,000 jobs in February, while wage growth ticked down to just a 0.2% month-over-month increase.
Over the last three months, the economy has
gained an average of 350,000 jobs per month with wage growth a modest 3.5%, consistent with the pace in 2019.
Rate hikes have caused some damage in the real estate, finance and technology sectors, but Main Street continues to chug along without creating excess wage growth.What do we see ahead? The turmoil in the banking sector will likely curtail new lending, and thus economic growth and inflation. The Fed may not have to raise rates quite as far as we had thought just a few weeks ago. The bad news: it probably also raises recession risks.
Keep things in perspective
When markets are volatile, we believe it is important to remember a few things.
Stick to your plan.
One of the most important steps in investing is designing a plan and a portfolio to match it. Understanding the purpose of an investment portfolio and the tools that you use to achieve outcomes can help you make better decisions in uncertain times.
Market volatility tends to cluster.
Our research shows that seven of the 10 best days for the equity market over the past 20 years have occurred within 15 days of the 10 worst days. If you missed just the 10 best days, it would have reduced your total return by 4% per year, relative to staying invested.
Focus on the long term.
Markets can have bad days, weeks and years. But over a longer time horizon, we can be much more certain about the range of possible outcomes. A 50/50 portfolio of stocks and bonds has never delivered a negative total return over a five-year time horizon. Equities have always been positive over a 20-year horizon.While there could be more strain ahead, policymakers have the tools to mitigate a great deal of risk and point to a clearer path forward. Coming back to that long-term mindset can do the same for you.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Interest rates are up; valuations look attractive—but recession risks loom. A timely response: Review your liquidity, lifestyle and legacy plans.Higher interest rates, resilient growth, stubborn inflation—and the looming prospect of a recession taking hold later in 2023—are reshaping the economic environment.
While you may be tempted to make similarly dramatic changes to your portfolio, instead consider organizing your wealth into three distinct “buckets”:
One to support your
liquidity
needs in the next one to five years
A second to cover your and your family’s
lifestyle
expenses over your lifetimes
The third to fund your
legacy
planning, both during life and after you are gone
Accordingly, each bucket—with its own distinct goal, time horizon and investment requirements—will react differently to changing market conditions, thus requiring you to take different actions in each.
With uncertainty still ahead, review each bucket to pinpoint opportunities (and vulnerabilities) to help keep on track your long-term plans for yourself, your family and your community. Here’s how.
Access cash when you need i
t
A “liquidity bucket” of assets provides you with ready access to the operating funds you/your family will need for the next several years to:
Cover your/your family’s month-to-month living expenses
Pay for large expenditures, such as capital calls, real estate purchases or tax payments
Take advantage of unexpected investment opportunities
Provide a psychological safety net
This bucket is your “sleep at night” money.
It includes actual cash in your safe, deposits, money market accounts and short-duration fixed income (bonds). It also can include securities-based lines of credit or equity in a home (accessed through home equity lines of credit, for example).
Moves you might consider making now
With interest rates higher today than they have been for more than 10 years, implementation matters:
Identify the appropriate amount of cash
—Be clear about your primary liquidity needs, and move excess funds to your lifestyle and legacy buckets
Use short-term investment vehicles
—A short-duration bond strategy can help you enhance yield, keep funds readily available and avoid significant market risk for near-term goals
Lock in today’s higher yields
before rates fall
—The turmoil in banks make it more likely that the Federal Reserve is at the end of the hiking cycle. Thus, you may consider locking in the yield on a municipal bond rather than rolling over T-bills, given the potential for capital appreciation when interest rates eventually fall
Borrow from a line of credit or home equity loan
—Despite slightly higher borrowing costs, bridge lumpy or unexpected cashflows and avoid having to sell longer-term investments, which may force you to realize capital gains or reduce market exposure at inopportune times
Maintain your lifestyl
e
Regardless of what happens this year (e.g., if you retire, experience a large loss of capital in a business or concentrated investment, suddenly find yourself unable to work), your lifestyle bucket should provide long-term financial security for:
You
—Food and dining, clothes and other luxury items, real estate carrying costs and household staff, travel, ongoing large purchases (i.e., the nuts and bolts of daily life)
Your family
—Ongoing gifts to family members, tuition for children and/or grandchildren, wedding expenses, upkeep of the family’s summer home
Your community
—Gifts, such as donations to your alma mater or religious organization, or other philanthropic commitments that you consider part of your ongoing lifestyle expenses
Think of this bucket as a lockbox, holding all the financial resources you need to set aside—and invest appropriately—to meet your and your family’s highest priority spending needs and wants over the course of your lifetimes.
In contrast to a liquidity bucket, a lifestyle bucket contains mid- and long-horizon financial and investment strategies, including stocks; mid- and longer-duration fixed income (bonds); cash to regularly replenish the liquidity bucket; and diversified alternative investments, including private equity and hedge funds.
Moves you might consider making now
Make sure your assets are working well together as the economic environment changes:
Revisit fixed income allocations
—Now that interest rates are higher, bonds once again are an attractive investment opportunity. Add longer-duration vehicles for portfolio diversification, attractive yields and the potential for capital appreciation
Evaluate equity positions
—We believe equity markets are at an attractive entry point following a reset in valuations, though you may want to avoid mega-cap technology stocks in favor of opportunities in U.S. mid-cap and European equities. If you have a concentrated position, understand its potential
impact on your plan
if it were to move significantly downward
Maximize tax efficiency
—Retain as much of your investment return as possible by harvesting losses, maximizing contributions to tax-deferred accounts, and placing high-return and ordinary-income investments in tax-advantaged accounts
Consider tax-aware borrowing
—Yes, higher interest rates have made mortgages more expensive. However, projected returns also have increased and could still outpace the cost of debt. In this environment, excess equity in real estate may be a source of investment capital, and if structured appropriately—can create opportunities for interest-rate deductions not available with standard mortgage financing
Consider your legac
y
By definition, legacy assets are not the ones that support your lifestyle—although they can be a source of additional funding (via a sale or loan, for example) if you need to replenish your lifestyle bucket at a future date.
This bucket holds the assets you want to use to provide for others (your family or favorite charities), typically well into the future. Given the longer time horizon of a legacy bucket, this is where to consider assigning your highest-risk, most illiquid assets.
Quantifying a legacy bucket can help you clarify the details of your goals for these assets. Who do you wish to benefit beyond yourself or your lifetime? When—and under what conditions—should these beneficiaries receive assets? What impact do you want your assets to have on your family and community?
Legacy goals can be achieved in many ways, including with life insurance, irrevocable gift trusts, complex wealth structures, general investments, real estate, art, jewelry and more. Similarly, philanthropic gifts can be made via donor-advised funds (DAFs) or family foundations.
Moves you might consider making now
Given attractive entry points and currently generous U.S. tax laws, you may want to consider putting your excess wealth to work now:
Take advantage of lifetime estate and gift tax exemptions
—The
lifetime exemption is currently $12.92 million for individuals ($25.84 million for married couples), but is set to decrease in 2026, to about $7 million per person. Consider gifting assets with growth potential (including interests in a privately held business) now, before a rebound occurs. This way, growth that occurs will be off your balance sheet
Review life insurance policies
—Determine whether your existing policies are still on track to accomplish their purpose—or if market volatility has depleted their cash value, thereby putting the policies at risk. Many people with illiquid estates use life insurance to help pay estate taxes. Or they find it beneficial for wealth transfer purposes, as a non-correlated, tax-efficient asset class. Review ownership and beneficiaries to ensure that the policy is as tax-efficient as possible
Invest for the long term
—Even
if there’s a recession later this year,
we still believe the current market has one of the best entry points for investment portfolios in the last decade. We expect new equity market leaders to emerge in sectors such as U.S. Small-Mid Cap and Dividend Growth, creating
opportunities for long-term investors

Market update
The crossroads
This week tested policymakers’ resolve to calm the turmoil caused by the banking sector, while also fighting inflation. Stocks and bonds swung on every headline.
Heading into Friday, investors seemed to be taking shelter in high-quality tech companies, pushing the market higher despite volatility in both large and regional banks.At Wednesday’s Federal Reserve meeting, the central bank raised rates by another 25 basis points (bps), bringing the cumulative total over the last year to a staggering 475 bps. Policy rates are now the highest they’ve been since 2007, and financial conditions have tightened meaningfully as a result. The banking sector is the latest to feel the impact.
From here, the banking shock should work to slow the economy, and may accelerate the path to recession. As a result, the Fed may be nearing the end of its rate hiking cycle. Its projections released this week suggest just one more hike this year. But as Chair Powell made clear, if things change and the outlook darkens, policymakers seem to have the right tools to help support the economy and financial markets if it’s needed.
Also in the press conference, Chair Powell clearly stated that the banking system was “sound and resilient.” While we wouldn’t say the current banking sector turmoil is over, we tend to agree. We may be at a crossroads in terms of monetary policy and the growth outlook, but we don’t believe the challenges we face today are like the Global Financial Crisis.
Spotlight
Why this isn’t the Global Financial Crisis
This latest episode of banking turmoil has reminded many of the Global Financial Crisis. Investors are concerned that the problems in U.S. regional banks and certain European lenders such as Credit Suisse are analogous to the first tremors of the crisis in late 2007 and early 2008. A similar upheaval in the financial system, deep recession, painful deleveraging and staggered recovery would obviously be very detrimental to the economy and investment portfolios.
The banking system is, and has always been, built on confidence. When confidence comes into question, it can lead to a sense of panic that feeds on itself and becomes hard to contain. It also makes this situation very difficult to forecast with any precision.
While there is tremendous uncertainty, given that the banking sector drives credit creation and subsequent economic growth, this episode is probably a negative for the market and economic outlook.
But this probably isn’t 2008, for three key reasons:
Policymakers have tools to solve banking crises, and the bigger banks are much stronger
The economy is in a much different place
The magnitude of the problem is, so far, much smaller
Policymakers have the tools to solve a banking crisis, and the bigger banks are much stronger
The primary function of central banks isn’t managing inflation and employment, it is acting as a lender of last resort. In this way, central banks provide the bedrock for the banking system. The Fed’s ability to perform this role expanded during the Global Financial Crisis. It created many different types of lending facilities to provide liquidity to banks, and many former “broker-dealers” (such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs) became bank holding companies so that they could access them.
Policymakers also understand how impactful decisive action can be. The new Bank Term Funding Program they instituted the other week is designed to alleviate the pressure that banks face from unrealized losses on their portfolios of high-quality Treasury, agency and mortgage-backed debt securities. U.S. dollar swap lines are also underappreciated tools that alleviate the strain that can come from a global scramble for dollars. During the Global Financial Crisis, the U.S. dollar surged 25% in 12 months following the Bear Stearns collapse. Throughout this episode, the dollar has been falling, which signals a more sanguine liquidity environment.
While the nominal amount drawn from the Fed’s discount window (the primary facility through which banks can borrow) is concerning, it also seems to have been concentrated in the banks that are under the most stress (three of which have already failed). It usually isn’t “good” when banks are using the discount window, but it does signal that the Fed is able to serve its primary function for the financial system.It is also clear that policymakers are trying to ring-fence the weakest links in order to arrest a downward spiral in confidence. It may take time, a more powerful form of intervention, capital raises at much lower valuations, or a combination of all three, but policymakers understand what it takes to soften the blow of a banking crisis.
Post–financial crisis regulations have required the largest financial institutions to be much less levered, better capitalized, more transparent and more liquid. The Volcker Rule prohibits banks from having their own proprietary trading and investment desks that could put depositor funds at risk. They also have lower reliance on wholesale (i.e., market-based) funding from institutional investors that is usually less sticky than standard deposits. The biggest banks are much stronger now than they were in 2008.
The big risk in the current instance is deposit flight, but that could prove to be an easier problem to solve than the core issues of leverage, mistrust between financial institutions, deteriorating credit and asset quality in the U.S. housing market, and difficult price discovery that occurred in 2008. On the other hand, profitability of the banking sector will likely be impaired as banks raise rates on deposit accounts and add debt to their balance sheets to add capital.
The economy is in a much different place
When J.P. Morgan purchased Bear Stearns from the brink of failure in March 2008, the economy had shed jobs for three straight months, and the critical construction sector had peaked a full two years earlier. Home prices peaked in the spring of 2007, and there was a tremendous glut of supply: Vacant homes accounted for almost 15% of the total housing stock.
Household and corporate balance sheets were also much weaker. Mortgage debt was a staggering 65% of GDP versus a more manageable ~45% today. Consumer and corporate debt service ratios are at secular lows.Over the last three months, the economy has averaged 350,000 jobs gained per month, the construction sector is still growing, home prices are only down marginally from the peak, and housing inventory is very tight.
Today, the residential real estate market that was the epicenter of the 2008 collapse is much more resilient. Credit standards are higher (the cutoff for a bottom-quartile credit score today is above 700 versus 650 in 2007), and most borrowers are locked into a low rate.
The banks that are in trouble today had concentrated deposit bases and poor interest rate risk management, not necessarily bad loans. Further, the FDIC has guaranteed the deposits of failed banks, so there has been no asset impairment (at least so far). The extent to which FDIC deposit insurance is augmented is still an outstanding question, but any action on that front could reduce the risk of further bank runs.
The growth picture going forward will probably be challenged as banks pull in their horns to manage through this shock, but this economy looks very different from the one that existed in 2008.
The magnitude of the problem, so far, is much smaller
At the time of failure, Silicon Valley Bank ($209bn) and Signature Bank (~$110bn) combined have around half the assets that Lehman Brothers (~$640bn) had. Bear Stearns (~$400bn in assets) was also larger than each. That’s not to mention the many other firms that were acquired, placed into receivership or otherwise assisted by the government (Merrill Lynch, Wachovia, Washington Mutual and AIG come to mind).*
More importantly, the interconnectedness of the system in 2008 is hard to quantify. Trillions of dollars of opaque securities with tranches and derivatives formed a knot of Gordian proportions. The 2010 Dodd-Frank Act and subsequent regulations required these positions to be registered with transparent clearing houses. From a market perspective, the financial sector was the largest weight in the S&P 500 in 2008. Today, it’s ~13% weight is still meaningful, but it’s dwarfed by technology (~25%).
That isn’t to say this situation couldn’t spiral into a much larger problem. It is to say that as of now, the magnitude and potential for contagion due to complex counterparty risk seem much smaller than they were in March of 2008. For what it’s worth, the latest indications from real-time indicators of bank funding stress, searches for “deposit insurance” and similar phrases, and commentary from Fed Chair Powell suggest that deposit outflows have stabilized.
Most importantly, the fundamental nature of this problem is different.
The Global Financial Crisis was driven by price declines in low-quality assets with poor disclosure, leading to a solvency crisis. This episode has been driven by price declines in high-quality assets with pristine disclosure, leading to a liquidity issue.
Investment implications
Stick to your plan
This spate of banking stress is likely to drag on growth, and raises the (already elevated) probabilities of a recession later this year. Even if market volatility subsides in the coming weeks and months, banks will probably lend less. Less credit flowing into the economy means lower growth. We are particularly worried about the linkages between regional banks and the commercial real estate sector (especially office). On the other hand, it probably means less restrictive Fed policy and lower interest rates, which could lead to a further boost for the residential housing market.
But this seems like a very different situation than the Global Financial Crisis. Then, oversupply in the housing sector, poor underwriting standards, overleverage and interconnectedness combined to create a downward spiral for asset prices and the economy. Today, we are dealing with banks whose high-quality bond portfolios have lost value, depositors who can move their cash quickly, and the threat of impaired profitability for smaller banks as they raise deposit rates to compete with larger ones.
Markets, for their part, are already pricing in a materially weaker outlook for banks. In fact, the relative performance of banks versus the rest of the market is already commensurate with the experience of both the Savings and Loan crisis of the early 1990s and the Global Financial Crisis.
Investors should rely on steady hands to guide their long-term portfolios, and focus on investments that can protect through a downturn. This banking turmoil has references to 2008, but it probably isn’t a shot-for-shot remake.

Our Top Market Takeaways for March 31, 2023
Market update
Good riddance to March
This month has seen a lot—three U.S. bank failures (and one in Europe), emergency action by policymakers, hot inflation readings, more central bank rate hikes and a presidential indictment.
Yet markets have, for the most part, shaken it all off. A 60/40 portfolio of global stocks and bonds has returned +5% so far this year.
Tech has been a powerful force, up an astonishing ~20%, thanks to companies with flush balance sheets and strong management teams acting as high-quality havens. Stocks in Europe have outperformed their U.S. peers. And despite wild swings in rates, bonds have proven their value as essential portfolio protection. The power of diversification is at work.That doesn’t mean the coast is clear. When central banks hike interest rates and tighten the flow of credit to the economy, things tend to break. Different parts of the economy tend to break at different times—and this cycle has already seen corrections in housing, manufacturing and tech. Now, it’s banks, which can feel especially bad, given their place at the epicenter of the economy. While markets seem keen to move on, we likely haven’t yet seen all the aftershocks.
Spotlight
The ripple effects of the bank shock
Based on what we know now, this episode doesn’t look systemic, and
it doesn’t look like another 2008
. However, the cracks are evident, and as investors, we’re focused on sizing up the impact. Here, two questions are key: Are there signs of contagion? And what other pressure points could be lurking?
1) Are there signs of contagion?
The recent shock has left bank customers questioning just how safe the cash is in their checking or savings accounts. That worry has sent deposits rushing out of small banks and into both large banks and money market funds (which invest in things such as low-risk, cash-like instruments and short-term bonds—and often offer higher yields). Over the last few weeks, money market funds have seen their largest inflows since early in the pandemic, bringing their total assets to over $5 trillion (the most on record).
If this trend accelerates, and all depositors demand their money back at the same time, this can put banks in a tough spot. When it happened
with Silicon Valley Bank (SVB)
, the bank had to sell some of its assets at a big loss to pay back its flighty depositors (who were largely concentrated in an interconnected web of tech startups). And it still wasn’t enough. The fear then follows—when confidence in the banking system is shaken, will it ricochet to the point of contagion?
There are promising signs that some of the worry is abating.
For one, policymakers have made a big effort to not only backstop failed banks (such as SVB and Signature Bank), but to also provide liquidity to all banks (for instance, through the Federal Reserve’s discount window and new Bank Term Funding Program). This helps ensure banks have the cash on hand to meet the demands of their depositors.
How much these facilities are used can give us a sense of the degree of panic depositors may be feeling and, in turn, the pressure banks may be facing. While banks have tapped the Fed’s and other sources of liquidity, this borrowing now seems to be decelerating (albeit remaining elevated). This suggests that liquidity strains at least aren’t getting worse.That said, things can change quickly, and banking system stress is still high.
If things take a turn for the worse, this begs the question of what more policymakers can do. A number of industry leaders have called for enhancing the FDIC’s deposit insurance, which currently guarantees that deposits are safe if a bank fails—but just up to a limit of $250,000. This means almost half of U.S. bank deposits today are uninsured. But while upping the limit and extending insurance to all banks could reduce the risk of further bank runs, such action is politically contentious and would require action from Congress. It’s possible, but could be a tall feat.
2) What other pressures are lurking?
To keep deposits in the door, banks may be forced to offer higher rates that compete with other banks and money market funds. They also may be more reticent to lend in an uncertain environment. All of this cuts into banks’ profitability—and the upcoming earnings season should provide an initial sense of these challenges.
What’s more, the bank shock has highlighted gaps in existing regulations. Moving forward, regulators will likely take a stricter approach to current rules, as well as introduce new ones in time. Yesterday already brought an example of this, with the White House calling for regulators to tighten their grip on mid-sized banks.
Finally, the impact of the shock isn’t limited to the banking system, prompting many to question what may be the next shoe to drop. Here, it matters who smaller banks have been lending to, and concerns have been growing around commercial real estate (CRE). The sector has already come under pressure as interest rates have risen, but this dynamic is now in acute focus, given CRE makes up almost half of small banks’ loans.The most vulnerable area looks like offices. Disrupted by the rise of remote work (which is still 7x of what it was before the pandemic), office CRE is likely to go through a real reckoning—perhaps as serious as the Global Financial Crisis. Yet it’s worth noting that the office subsector represents just ~14% of all CRE (and office construction is just 0.4% of overall GDP). Further, not all CRE is created equal: Segments such as data centers, hospitals, apartments, retail and the like don’t seem to be facing the same pressures. Markets seem to be acknowledging at least some of this difference in risk.Investment implications
Defensive, not fearful
Even if market volatility subsides, banks will probably lend less—but just how much is still an open question. We tend to be less optimistic, given that small banks have driven the majority of lending over the last six months and also tend to make loans to small businesses, which employ 80% of the workforce. In all, less credit flowing into the economy tends to mean lower growth, and this could accelerate the path to recession.Tighter credit conditions from the banking sector can do the same job as rate hikes, which means that the Fed probably doesn’t have to raise interest rates as much as it otherwise would have. That said, sticky inflation is still a going concern.
We are focused on investments that are more defensive and can offer protection in a downturn. The quick collapse in yields over the last month demonstrates why bonds are essential. Strategies such as structured notes can help you stay invested in both the good days and the bad, through protecting gains and building in a buffer from adverse moves lower. Sectors such as reasonably priced technology, healthcare and industrials could be bellwethers as other cyclical parts of the market struggle. And as growth grows more scarce in the United States,
prospects in Europe and China look a bit better
.
Above all, stick with your investment plan. History suggests that this too shall pass, and investors are less likely to suffer losses over longer periods—especially in a diversified portfolio.

-	60/40: +4.8%. The line started at 0 on January 2, 2023, and peaked at 7.5% on February 2, 2023, before going down to a bottom of 1.6% on March 10, 2023, and recovered to the recent data point of 4.8% on March 30, 2023.
-	Global bonds: +2.9%. The line started at 0 on January 2, 2023, and peaked at 4.7% on February 2, 2023, before going down to a low point of -0.6% on March 7, 2023, and then recovered to the most recent data point at 2.9% on March 30, 2023.
-	Large banks: -7.8%. The line started at 0 on January 2, 2023, and peaked at 10.7% on February 7, 2023. It then trended down until the recent data point at -7.8% on March 30, 2023. 
-	Regional banks: -31.8%. The line started at 0 on January 2, 2023, and peaked at 13.8% on February 2, 2023. Then it went down a big decline until the recent data point at -31.8% on March 30, 2023.This bar chart describes the Federal Reserve’s discount window and how much the Fed lent out through its Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) in March 2023, as well as the peak usage during the Global Financial Crisis and COVID-19.

It ramped all the way up to reach a peak at 15.7% in June 2022 before coming down to the recent data point of 6.9% in March 2023.
For large banks, the first data point came in at -2.4% in January 2021 and went up to a peak of 8.8% in June 2022 before dropping to the current level of 1.0% in March 2023.
For small banks, the first data point came in at -3.0% in January 2021 and went up to +3.6% in April 2021 before getting down to a low of -1.0% in July 2021.

Looking back
Our report card
It’s been a bumpy week. A handful of the latest reads on the economy—from leading indicators, such as PMIs, to gauges on the labor market, such as job openings—have signaled slowing growth. That’s sent bond yields lower and stocks down slightly from their recent highs.
In our
2023 Outlook
, we asked investors to “See the Potential” for weaker growth, but stronger markets. So far, that thesis is on track. While growth seems to be slowing down, and new challenges have arisen, markets so far have delivered a much stronger performance than they did in 2022.
Now that the first quarter is over, we wanted to revisit the core tenets of our 2023 Outlook to make an honest judgment about how things are shaping up and to provide our thoughts on what’s to come. We take each pillar of our Outlook in turn.
1. The best in a decade.
A dramatic reset in valuations has, in our view, created one of the most attractive entry points for stocks and bonds in over a decade.
On track.
Markets have powered through all the turmoil that 2023 has thrown at it. Through the first quarter, a diversified portfolio of global stocks and bonds has returned roughly +6%. Over the last six months, that portfolio is up an even more impressive 10%. What is perhaps most encouraging is that stocks and bonds are both doing their jobs. Equities are driving appreciation (MSCI World +7.6%), while bonds are providing a stable ballast (global aggregate bonds +4.0%).
We believe multi-asset portfolios are on track to continue outperforming cash and inflation this year.2. Bad news, good news.
The bad news: We think a recession is likely in 2023. The good news: Central banks should stop hiking and inflation will likely fall.
On track.
The turmoil in the banking sector seems like the latest sign that recession probabilities are elevated. Even if the most acute phase of the bank shock has passed, lending to small businesses from banks ought to be more impaired going forward. On the other hand, it seems like inflation is past its peak, and the process of a slow grind back toward more tolerable levels is underway. Encouragingly, wage inflation and other measures of labor market tightness (such as job openings and quits) do not suggest a wage-price spiral even though the labor market has remained resilient (tomorrow’s U.S. jobs report will be the latest indication of any cracks possibly developing).
Given progress on the inflation front and financial stability concerns, the Federal Reserve appears to be on track to pause its rate-hiking cycle sometime this summer.
3. Bonds are back.
Core fixed income now offers the potential for protection, yield and capital appreciation.
Exceeding expectations.
U.S. core bonds are up +4% so far this year, and we still think fixed income is set to deliver steady returns in a slower growth and lower inflation environment. To be clear, bonds have seen a strong rally over the last month (10-year Treasury yields are down to 3.3% from a year-to-date high over 4%) as softer inflation data and financial turmoil have emboldened the market to start pricing rate cuts as soon as this summer. In the very near term, it seems like markets may be getting ahead of themselves. Bonds have exceeded expectations so far this year, and we may get better entry points in the weeks and months ahead.
But this is how we would think about it as long-term investors: The Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index is down over 10% from its all-time highs. Over the last 40+ years, this is still the biggest dip in core bonds that investors have had the opportunity to buy.4. Reversal of fortunes.
We expect mega-cap technology stocks to underperform and small-cap stocks to outperform.
Needs improvement.
Mega-cap tech has soared this year. The NASDAQ 100 is up over +20%, and the NYSE FANG+ Index is up almost +40%. Meanwhile, mid- and small-cap stocks are both up a relatively meager +2.5–3.5%. We still expect U.S. SMID-cap stocks to
outperform their larger peers
over the course of the next cycle, but this particular call needs improvement to prove correct. In the words of
The Wire
’s Omar Little, if you come at the king, you best not miss.
After releasing our outlook in December, we also warmed up to
European and Chinese equities
. Europe has posted a very solid 11%+ return for U.S.-dollar-based investors so far this year (outperforming the S&P 500’s +7%), and China offers investors with a higher-risk, higher-reward equity market, given tailwinds from reopening and shifting policymaker priorities. Neither has kept up with the mega-cap behemoths, but we believe they are poised for a relatively strong rest of the year.
5. Real money.
The era of underinvestment in the real economy is over.
Keep up the hard work.
This one is too early to tell, but all the seeds are sown for an era of investment in the physical economy. Shortages in housing, infrastructure, transportation and energy will likely take years to correct.
In the United States, as our Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon noted in his
annual letter
, several recent legislative initiatives such as the Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS Act have the potential to catalyze ~$1 trillion in clean technology development. In Europe, similar plans are underway to spur investment in the energy transition and defense, and the COVID-era EU Recovery Fund already got a jump start on digitizing and boosting critical infrastructure.
In the near term, real economy sectors such as autos, homebuilders and semiconductors have outperformed so far this year, but this is a thesis that we expect to play out over the course of the next decade.
As for what we’re watching, we’re adding a few courses to this quarter’s syllabus to gauge the path forward:
Economics: The Art of the Pivot.
The Fed has the tall order of cooling the economy down with as little economic pain as possible. But with inflation sticky, the most likely cost of getting things under control looks like a recession. The trick will be raising rates high enough and holding long enough to slow things down, while also knowing when to start cutting when growth becomes precarious. The bite of last year’s rate hikes and tighter lending conditions from banks should pressure growth further. We think this means the Fed will hike once more in May and hold on until the final months of this year, when our base case of a recession will likely unfold. For investors, that pivot could provide some much-desired clarity.
History: Is This Time Different? The Study of Crises.
In addition to combating inflation, the Fed is focused on the separate but intertwined task of maintaining financial stability. While there may be
further shocks
, we believe this situation looks
very different from the Global Financial Crisis
, and bank stress is showing meaningful signs of easing. That said, confidence can be tricky, and it will be a dynamic we’ll continue to watch.
Finance: The Business Life Cycle.
It matters how this all affects corporate profits. Heading into this year, many expected earnings to rapidly deteriorate and catalyze another round of market weakness. And while momentum is definitely slowing, the last quarter showed that the average company in the S&P 500 still grew earnings by 3%. Headwinds such as slower growth, higher prices and general business uncertainty must then also be weighed against tailwinds such as growing efforts to cut costs, stronger supply chains and a weaker U.S. dollar (which makes it easier for multinationals to do business abroad). How businesses are impacted by the changing tide—and react to it—will be key, and we’ll get a further sense of this as Q1 earnings season kicks off next Friday.
Home Economics: Personal Finance and Planning.
We’ve said over the last few weeks that steady hands often prevail. While markets can always have a bad day, week, month or even year, history suggests investors are less likely to suffer losses over longer periods—especially in a diversified portfolio.
Heading into the holiday weekend, we’d like to say a quick thank you to all our readers. We’re grateful to be able to share our insights with you. Here’s to the rest of the year ahead.

Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to substantial gain or loss. ​
Small capitalization companies typically carry more risk than well-established ""blue-chip"" companies since smaller companies can carry a higher degree of market volatility than most large cap and/or blue-chip companies.​
International investments may not be suitable for all investors. International investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility. Changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the U.S. can raise or lower returns. Some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the United States and other nations. Investments in international markets can be more volatile.​

MR. MICHAEL CEMBALEST:  Good morning and welcome to the April Eye on the Market podcast, entitled Frankenstein’s Monster.  In the 1800s, there was an Italian scientist named Luigi Galvani that was experimenting with electricity and, and frogs to see if he could generate movement in them after they died.  And it was the inspiration for the Frankenstein—Dr.  Frankenstein novel.  And that’s a metaphor that I was thinking about this week is creating life in inanimate body parts, that, that he happened to source from deceased criminals, using energy from a lightning storm, might have sounded great on paper.  But the invention, obviously, ended up having some negative consequences that Dr. Frankenstein didn’t think about.  And I think the same is true for the Fed.  They were very excited and convinced the 10 years of negative policy rates—10-year treasury yields below 1% and a doubling of the balance sheet from four and a half to nine trillion was, in just two years recently, was the right thing to do and was the largest monetary experiment US history.  Turns out that has negative, unintended consequences, as well.
And like the townspeople all fleeing Frankenstein’s monster, some depositors are now very wary of US banks with substantial underwater loans and securities whose yields the Fed had manipulated. So in our March 10
th
piece, we had a chart that, that went viral for all of the obvious reasons. It was a chart that showed the pro forma impact of unrealized securities losses on bank capital ratios. But in the rush to write something on the day that Silicon Valley Bank failed, I neglected to mention another casualty based on the Fed policy, which is, all the residential mortgage loans and other loans that were underwritten at perfectly reasonable loan to value and debt to income, but at very low coupon rates.  And now that mortgage rates have doubled from three to six percent, there’s another issue to think about here, which is the unrealized losses on loans due to higher interest rates.
So the—we have an adjusted chart in this week’s piece on that issue.  And so then you see the common tier one capital ratio for each bank, adjusted then for losses on securities, like last time, and then also adjusted for additional losses, unrealized losses on loans. And there’s a couple of charts in here showing that the more—that certainly banks differed in terms of how well their management teams navigated this monetary experiment.  But the more you got flooded with deposits from 2019 to 2021, the bigger the challenge was.  Because a lot of those banks just had so much money to put to work.  And a lot of their preferred stocks are now trading at distressed levels, reflecting that.  Now to be clear, the presence of unrealized losses on a balance sheet of a bank is not abnormal and is consistent with what happens when rates go up. The problem this time is that some banks got so many stimulus related deposits at a time of low rates that their balance sheets are stuffed with these low yielding assets.
And then to reiterate, this is only a problem when large deposit outflows cause unrealized losses to be realized.  So the new rules at the discount window that allows for banks to borrow against securities at original book value rather than lower market value should help, but it doesn’t address all the problems for all the banks.  Many system indicators are now stabilizing.  But that could change.  And we have some charts in here showing that the drawdown in commercial bank deposits is now one of the largest on record.  The pace of the drawdown has slowed.  The drawdown has been concentrated obviously in smaller regional banks.  The discount window borrowing has stabilized.  It looks like the money—the money market fund inflow surge has stabilized, as well.
Again, we have charts in here on all of this.  Borrowing by the Federal Home Loan Bank reflects member banks borrowing from it, that’s also come down from peak levels.  And regional bank stocks have stabilized.  That said, Friday after the—last Friday, after the close, First Republic announced that it was suspending payments on its preferred stock.  And so obviously, some of these stresses are ongoing.  But I thought it was important to give everybody an update in this week’s piece on the issue of the unrealized losses on loans, because that’s a peculiar issue in this cycle that we have to think about, as well.
In addition to Frankenstein, there was another monster sighting recently.  Swiss Regulators reenacted a scene from Struwwelpeter, if you don’t know who he is, you’ll have to look him up, and completely wiped out Credit Suisse contingent capital securities, and delivered even larger losses to those holders than those experienced by owners of the Credit Suisse common stock.  I won’t go into detail here.  This is an issue that’s not of interest to everyone.  I looked into the European CoCos market in 2016, with Anton, my colleague, Anton Pil, and we were really skeptical about their investment merit in times of stress.  And we wrote that buyers are essentially selling a bunch of short options on the bank’s earnings power, its capital base, the business cycle and regulatory discretion.  And we thought this optionality was extremely underpriced.  We were concerned that incentives might even prompt issuers or governments to wipe out these contingent capital securities in advance of a cap—in advance of a capital raise.  And we included it in this month’s Eye on the Market, the text we wrote at the time.
The bottom line is that the Swiss—the Credit Suisse CoCos prospectus clearly states that what could—what happened to the contingent capital securities was part of the risk from the beginning, write down events, viability events, it was all there. And as unorthodox as some of this may seem, the risks that were highlighted in the prospectus, and it’s entirely consistent with what we wrote about at the time, which is that there’s a lot of regulatory discretion involved in investing in these European contingent capital securities.
A lot of people are arguing, I’ve been reading that, well, the, the UK and the other European versions of these are not the same as the Swiss versions. Well, technically, that’s true. There are some circumstances when European or UK banks would be undercapitalized.  And instead of seeing these securities written to zero, they would simply have their payments suspended for some period, or maybe converted into common equity.  But all those provisions are only applicable in cases where the bank is still a going concern and has breached its capital ratio trigger. And that’s possible.  But look at Credit Suisse. They went from viable on Thursday, to unviable on Sunday, without any undercapitalized phase in between. And these days, when banks fail, it can happen so rapidly that you don’t get that intermediate phase where there’s a time to think about what’s going on, and okay, let’s convert the preferreds to something else.
With all of those other CoCos securities in other countries in Europe, if those banks went from viable to unviable quickly, they would be written down to zero, as well.  So we have a couple of pages in here that explain these issues.  And in some ways, the most concerning thing is, you know, I joined J.P. Morgan in 1987, and consider myself someone who understands the financial sector.  It’s, it’s, it’s unnerving that the capital and liquidity statistics that, that everyone relies upon, ended up being of such little use in assessing the insolvency risks of Credit Suisse.  We have a table in here showing how Credit Suisse ranked at or near the top versus all of the other EU banks on all sorts of capital liquidity ratios.  And they failed anyway.  So profitability is something that those ratios don’t capture, and is one of the reasons why we focus a lot on profitability and balance sheet strength when we’re trying to figure out how healthy these banks are.
The longer section in this month’s Eye on the Market is on commercial real estate.  And everyone’s talking about it. And there’s a good reason that everybody’s talking about commercial real estate, given the post-COVID occupancy shock that’s taking place in the office sector, on top of the adjustments that have already taken place in retail over the last few years.  So at first glance, the commercial real estate excesses don’t look that bad in this cycle. There were two prior cycles that were much worse.  One took place in the mid-1980s, and the other one, obviously, right before the financial crisis in 2008.  We have some brief descriptions of what the catalysts were in both of those prior periods.  The amount of commercial real estate borrowing as a percentage of GDP is roughly half of those peaks this time around.  The underwriting in the commercial mortgage-backed securities markets are also much better than they were before the financial crisis in terms of loan to value and credit enhancement, and the rating agencies and investors and the legal system has done a much better job this time around.
There’s three big buts here.  First, commercial real estate—commercial mortgage-backed securities may be underwritten better this time around, but they’re only 10 to 15 percent of all commercial real estate lending.  The vast majority comes from regional US banks, which have accounted for 90% of the increase in bank lending since 2015.  So what the regional banks are doing, in terms of their underwriting standards, that, that, that’s what matters, that’s point number one.  Point number two is that there are some structural post-COVID occupancy problems in the office market that may result in extremely conservative lending standards, even to trophy properties.  And then the third issue is, it just turns out that the next couple of years are peak years for commercial real estate maturities across the whole spectrum of CMBS, banks, insurance and other lenders.
So the issue of the—of the stresses in the office market are interesting.  Right? You can look at vacancy, you can look at shadow vacancy, which is space under construction, or space which is where the leases are expiring soon and things like that.  The controversial part is the estimate of the—of the third thing, which is underutilized space.  And when COVID started, we started tracking Kastle data, Kastle with a K.  It’s a company that looks at all the key fob swipes and looks at that as a measure of office utilization.  Now, some Kastle utilization statistics feel really low to us.  New York City is an example.  According to the Kastle data, New York office utilization is only back at 50%. That feels low.  Because when we look at the Long Island Railroad, subway, Metro North and buses, all of those things are back up at about 70 to 75% in terms of utilization compared to pre-COVID levels.  And so—and all of those people, or most of those people, are coming into work. And so it’s an imperfect measure.  That said, these key fob swipes is one way to start in terms of thinking about the pressure on the office market.
And we’ve got some statistics here, most of which, a lot of which, not all of which, but a lot of which looked pretty gruesome for the office markets in terms of really high levels of vacancy, increasing amounts of sublet space and then the work from home trends which are—which are kind of unrelenting. So the share of hours worked remotely is now about 30%.  It was 60% at the peak, during COVID.  But much higher than the pre-pandemic levels, I don’t know why my computer keeps doing that.  I apologize.  Then 4%.  So 4% was the amount of hours worked remotely before the pandemic peaked at 60, now at 30, and has been stable there for quite some time. And employees in surveys continue to, to desire something like two and three-quarters work from home days a week, compared to two and a quarter from employers. That, that implies that this work from home stuff is, is here to stay.
And so we have information here on office rent growth and leasing activity. And then, some of the—some of the expectations from some of the sell side reports are, are pretty dire.  There was a Morgan Stanley REET [phonetic] report that assumed underwriting at 40%, LTVs continued in declines, and net operating income is seven and a half percent cost of debt. All of which would result in cap rates for office of almost 10%, and a 40% decline in office values from current levels over the next couple of years. That sounds really dire to me.  But as an exercise, we do have a chart in here that shows how property underwritten a few years ago, if it’s debt happens to come to—due today, and the cap rates 200 basis points higher, NOI has declined and a modestly lower loan to value, you could quickly see the debt, let’s say it was 70% of the property value before, would now be underwritable only at 40% today. So that’s a lot of pressure on properties that are seeing their debts mature.
And then the last part of this section looks at what’s going on with the regional banks and how they’re the largest lenders in hotels, retails, industrial, and office. And we have a chart in here that looks by bank at commercial real estate as a percentage of total loans, and then office as a percentage of those commercial real estate loans.  And obviously, some of the—some of the smaller regional banks really stick out here.  J.P. Morgan’s Investment Bank did a stress test that assumed some pretty severe delinquency and low recovery rate assumptions for office and for retail.  They only ended up with about a .4% at most hit to the tier one capital ratios, which doesn’t sound that bad.  The problem is that their analysis also assumed that 2022 levels of pre-provision income would persist over the next few years.  So if you make a lot of money, it’s easy to absorb write offs on bad loans. But something tells me that a weakening economy and higher deposit rates are going to squeeze those pre-provision income levels, in which case, the hit to capital would eventually be higher.
So that’s a lot of information already in this podcast. There’s a—there’s a two-page summary of our economic and market views in here in terms of how the US data looks very good contemporaneously for q1.  But what are some of the weakening indicators that we see for q2, q3.  And then, at the—at the back, we have a one-pager on a table on San Francisco, which is kind of incredible to see.  It looks at downtown recovery rankings for the largest 60 cities in all of North America.  And San Francisco comes in dead last in terms of its downtown recovery compared to pre-COVID levels. And there are some big questions here about municipal solvency, public transit, the impact of rezoning and a bunch of other things that will be focused on in the years ahead.  But this was a—this is a very stark table when you look at what’s going on in San Francisco versus the rest of the country.
So that’s it for this month.  If you missed it, our 13
th
annual energy paper was released at the end of March, and—along with a podcast and a webcast and things like that.  And, and so make sure that you take a look at that, as well, if you’re interested in the subject matter. Thanks for listening, and we’ll talk to you again next time.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Consider this potential global megatrend—a potential opportunity for attractive returns and to address a top planetary threatDid you know that one of the gravest environmental threats is also one of today’s most exciting investment themes?
1
We’re talking about the current food supply chain.
How produce is grown and harvested, how livestock are raised, the use of agricultural chemicals and plastic food packaging—in short, the food system—ends up polluting soils and waterways. Agricultural land is also expanding worldwide at the expense of natural habitats. Scientists consider the current food system one of the most serious planetary threats.
But that’s only part of the story.
Innovative companies throughout the food supply chain are providing a range of strategies that we believe are investment opportunities potentially offering attractive returns.
Here’s why.
Reengineering the food system for biodiversity will likely attract capital
Scientists agree that biodiversity—the variety of animals, plants, insects (and microbes such as bacteria and fungi) and their habitats—is essential to the viability of human life. Biodiverse habitats provide us with the raw materials and clean water we need to live.
We think the innovative companies reengineering how the food system will work in the future present potential opportunities for investors to help promote and protect essential biodiversity while potentially earning attractive returns.
In our view, food system innovators are more likely to succeed than competitor companies that aren’t making the transition to producing with less of an influence on biodiversity—for economic reasons. Take a company selling organic, friendly microbes that make seeds sprout faster and are less expensive than fertilizer. We think that firm’s chances of success look better over the long run than the maker of a more expensive, conventional agricultural chemical that does the same thing.
Or take companies using precision agriculture (more on what that means below). They have lower input costs, can increase crop yields 5%–10% and reduce fertilizer use by 30%.
2
That’s a win-win situation—economic and environmental.
Companies are also looking to reinvent the world’s food supply chain because in its current state, our food ecosystem is helping drive unprecedented global biodiversity loss.
3
Pastureland is expanding at an unprecedented rate to meet growing demand for food, crowding out plants, animals and their habitats. Agriculture uses 70% of the planet’s fresh water and produces about one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs).
4
Intensive agriculture depletes the soil, and the runoff from synthetic chemical fertilizer damages habitats.
We see the following types of companies in the food value chain making positive contributions to biodiversity
and
potentially outperforming traditional indexes.
Alternative plant-based proteins
Companies making new, plant-based foods have the potential to achieve four goals at once:
Supply food for the world’s growing population
Use far less land than animals would for an equivalent output
Supply humans with needed protein (typically from legumes, such as lentils, peas, chickpeas and beans)
Boost soil fertility (because many legumes put nitrogen into the soil, which helps other plants to grow)
When it comes to the planet, a broad rise in plant-based proteins’ popularity would drastically reduce agricultural water use.
5
Legumes could eliminate vast amounts of fertilizer use, and greatly increase yields if they were planted simply as soil helpers, in rotation with cereal crops that deplete the quality of the soil.
What about the bottom line?
Consumers are already shifting away from foods whose production creates the highest GHG emissions. We think more people are likely to join the trend, making alternative proteins an interesting investment opportunity. Some experts believe alternative proteins have the potential to capture up to 60% of the meat market—a USD1.4 trillion global market by 2040.
6
Replacing chemical inputs with cutting-edge science
Biochemicals occur naturally in plants, animals and microorganisms, and act like fertilizers. Companies are commercializing them for agricultural use because they make crops more resilient, helping farmers reduce their use of more dangerous (and expensive) synthetic fertilizers whose polluting runoff damages biodiversity.
Biochemicals are especially appealing at a time when human-made fertilizer’s prices have exploded, one of the factors pushing food prices beyond the reach of many.
So-called “bio-science” innovator companies are producing natural enzymes and bacteria that speed seed germination and plant growth while enriching crops’ nutritional quality. They also require less energy than conventional farming techniques.
The bottom line? The market for beneficial insects and biochemicals, and other forms of crop protection, some experts project, may have an 8%–10% compound annual growth rate, and could expand to a USD30 billion industry globally by 2035.

Agricultural Innovations: Making agriculture less water-intensive and less polluting
Companies are tackling the food challenge from the water side in two ways: One, they’re reducing water as an input, especially in drought-prone areas, with technologies such as micro-irrigation, “digital water” (using sensors to, for example, monitor and measure soil and plants’ status to determine their precise water needs for conservation and efficiency), and closed-loop water recycling (as in vertical farming, which can recirculate most of the water that would be lost to evaporation out in the field).
Companies are also working on the wastewater side of the equation— aiming to prevent chemically tainted water as an output. They’re looking at treatment prior to release, for example, making infrastructure investments to stop the release of raw sewage into rivers and oceans.
Right now, the deployment of water recycling and micro-irrigation is limited. But important growing regions of the United States are already experiencing a profound water shortage, so we expect a strong demand for these companies and their technologies.
Sustainable food packaging
The images may be familiar: sea turtles strangled by plastic rings, birds and fish with stomachs full of plastics. Only 8% of plastics ever manufactured have been recycled to date.
8
About 78 million tons of plastic are produced annually.
9
Knowing plastics’ harmful impact on biodiversity, some packaging manufacturers in the food supply chain are using less of it—or using more recyclable materials such as cardboard. Some also are switching their processes. One packaging industry executive estimated plastic substitution to be a USD12.5 billion annual global opportunity
10
Another added benefit: switching from plastics to alternative packaging can also enhance food preservation.

, Senior Markets Economist
Jay Serpe
, Global Head of Alternative Investments, Strategy & Business Development
Ryan Asato, Manager Solutions, Alternative Credit
Renewed stress in the banking industry has a way of focusing the mind.
Since March, when the abrupt and unexpected failure of two regional U.S. banks, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, rocked U.S. markets, investors have begun voicing concerns about the balance sheet vulnerabilities of regional banks—and more specifically, their exposure to commercial real estate (CRE).
Those concerns have some merit. Compared to big banks, small banks hold 4.4 times more exposure to U.S. CRE loans than their larger peers. Within that cohort of small banks, CRE loans make up 28.7% of assets, compared with only 6.5% at big banks.
1
More worrying, a significant percentage of those loans will require refinancing in the coming years, exacerbating difficulties for borrowers in a rising rate environment.
Just how worried should you be? To help cut through the noise, we delve into commercial real estate to explain ongoing industry trends and how we expect them to impact different subsectors in the quarters and months ahead. Some of those shifts, such as the widespread adoption of hybrid work patterns post COVID-19, are still creating powerful headwinds for the office sector, which is particularly—although not uniformly—vulnerable. Other trends, such as the rise of e-commerce, continue to provide tailwinds for industrial assets, including logistics properties and warehouses. Reshoring—the process of bringing production and manufacturing of domestic goods back into their country of origin—could also benefit the industrial sector.
Here’s our main takeaway: The office sector faces its own particular set of challenges. Many other sectors within CRE have stronger fundamentals. Nor do we believe that potential losses within the office sector are likely to destabilize regional banks. From both a GDP and wealth perspective, the office sector represents a small part of the overall economy.
That said, the small bank lending channel more generally does represent a macro risk, as tighter lending standards and profitability challenges in the banking sector could reduce available financing and raise the cost for small and medium sized businesses. But it’s difficult to quantify this risk precisely, and the uncertainty surrounding potential offsets is high.
Worsening conditions challenge the office sector
Make no mistake: Rising rates are piling pressure on the troubled office sector. Vacancies soared in the early stages of the pandemic and have kept rising since. Today, as shown in the chart below, the office vacancy rate of 12.5% is comparable to where it was in 2010, one year out from the global financial crisis (GFC). Office sales volume is now approaching its post-GFC lows.The primary source of these challenges is the rise of remote work. Although more employees did return to offices in 2022, the outright level of remote work remains 7 times higher than it was in the pre-pandemic era. Layer on top of this the Federal Reserve’s historically rapid pace of interest rate rises over the past year, plus accelerating layoffs in professional and business services (e.g., in the technology sector) and the obsolescence of older office buildings, and it’s not hard to see pain in the office sector getting worse.Investors need to remember, however, that the office sector is bifurcated. Difficulties are emerging by geography—Chicago and San Francisco are much more challenged than Miami, Raleigh and Columbus, for example—and differentially affecting property vintages. Newer office builds, particularly those built after 2010, are seeing much stronger net absorption rates than older builds.
2
Inevitably, the tightening of credit availability and higher rates will spell trouble for some borrowers. Although the liquidation rate in the sector is low at present, we expect cumulative liquidations of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) for the office sector to rise to approximately 20% over the next 10 years (with cumulative losses expected to be approximately 8.5%).
3
This level of distress is comparable to percentages seen in the sector in the post-GFC years (chart below), but—importantly—it will likely take many years to play out.
4
In the short run, borrowers will likely take advantage of loan extension options. Looking further out, we expect to see CMBS loan maturities become more challenging by 2025–2027.
5The risk transmission mechanism: Rising rates can quickly erode valuations
Before putting the office sector in broader context, it’s worth reminding ourselves of the risk transmission mechanism at work in commercial real estate, because central bank policy affects even the most carefully selected properties.
CRE assets are very long duration in nature, so their values are particularly sensitive to interest rates. But how, exactly, do higher interest rates—holding everything else constant—erode the value of a particular building?
To answer that question, we need to look at the impact that higher capitalization rates (cap rates) have on commercial property valuations. A cap rate measures a property’s net operating income (NOI), revenue less operating expenses, divided by its market value. A high level point-in-time metric used to value CRE is to take a property’s net operating income and divide that by its cap rate.
In the chart below, our hypothetical example shows how the value of a USD 100 million office building would decline to USD 72 million if cap rates increased from 4.5% to 6.25% (holding NOI constant). If the borrower were to look at refinancing the loan at this lower valuation, keeping the loan-to-value ratio constant, the borrower would have to contribute an additional USD 18 million in equity to get the refinancing done.This example demonstrates just how vulnerable commercial real estate is to rising rates. If, in the months to come, the Federal Reserve (the Fed) raises rates even higher, some borrowers will likely struggle—and be unable or unwilling to provide additional capital to extend the life of their loans. Depending on the borrower and property fundamentals, however, that mismatch might not necessarily force borrowers to hand back their keys: Given current market conditions, we believe lenders are unlikely to repossess commercial properties that they would have to either manage or sell, especially at stressed valuations.
Instead of foreclosing, lenders may offer borrowers short-term forbearance or even modify their loans. After all, banks do have the flexibility to either extend a loan’s maturity, take a discounted payoff, or accept what’s known in the trade as a “deed in lieu” of foreclosure, which conveys all interest in a property to the lender to satisfy a loan that is in default.
Looking back at the early ’90s: CRE price cycles vs. GDP
Across all sectors, commercial real estate returns are currently down only about 3.5% from their peak in 2021, according to the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries (NCREIF). The composition of CRE returns in recent quarters suggests the decline has been entirely due to higher cap rates, as opposed to weak NOI growth (chart below). To the extent that interest rates remain higher than they were pre-pandemic and economic growth continues to slow, we will likely see more price deflation in CRE going forward.However, history suggests that CRE down cycles are less detrimental to GDP than residential real estate down cycles, given less spillover to the consumer.
The early 1990s recession offers a good example of this dynamic: Between 1989–1993, CRE prices fell by more than 20% from peak to trough, but—at the same time—the U.S. economy experienced one of the shallowest recessions in history, with real GDP falling by only 0.1% in 1991 (chart below).Differentiating within and across CRE sectors
Within the commercial real estate complex, the office sector is unique for its high and rising vacancy rate. Occupancy in other CRE sectors, most notably industrial and retail, remains tight, with vacancy rates well below pre-pandemic levels. Construction activity in the industrial sector has been booming; the current level of construction is at a secular high relative to GDP (charts below).Retail, on the other hand, is experiencing some headwinds, even though the vacancy rates are comparatively low. Ever since the GFC, retail construction projects have languished, in large part due to rising e-commerce activity, which creates more demand for logistics properties, such as warehouses, and less demand for brick and mortar assets.
In aggregate, retail is in a better place today than it was immediately after the GFC due to a lack of supply, but there are still challenges—especially for lower-quality assets, such as class B and C malls.
6
Distress continues to be high in this subset of the CMBS market, which accounts for approximately 5%–10% of the overall market.
7
Looking ahead, the resilience of the retail sector will largely depend on the confidence of the U.S. consumer over the next 12 months, despite an elevated probability of recession.
Although the apartment sector experienced tight market dynamics in 2021 and the first half of 2022, demand has now cooled: Vacancy rates are now close to where they were prior to the onset of the pandemic. This is largely a function of a slowdown in migration patterns across the U.S. Household formation has also slowed.
8
We expect the apartment market to continue to loosen, especially as additional supply becomes available. Currently, more than 950,000 multifamily projects are under construction across the U.S., the highest level of activity since the 1970s (chart below). We believe demand, however, is unlikely to collapse as it has in the office sector given favorable secular dynamics, including renting trends among Millennials, who are facing the worst homebuying conditions in 40 years.
9
Here again, demand is becoming increasingly bifurcated as rental markets in the South and Southwest remain strong, while coastal markets soften in the wake of recent tech industry layoffs.
10How would a CRE crisis impact the broader economy?
If we zoom out of CRE and contextualize the office sector in the broader U.S. economy, the backdrop becomes reassuring. From a wealth perspective, office assets represent a low share of the value of all physical capital across the country, at only 2.4% (chart below).
11
Offices represent only 14% of total CRE assets in the U.S.
12
If we think about this another way, the market capitalization of one company, Apple, is—at USD 2.6 trillion—larger than the entire capitalization of the U.S. office sector, at just over USD 2 trillion.
13From a flow perspective, office construction represents an even lower share of overall U.S. GDP, at only 0.4% (chart below). Unlike single family residential investment, which soared to more than 3.3% of GDP in the mid-2000s before crashing and bottoming out post-GFC at around 0.7%, the office sector, in isolation, would likely not have anywhere near the same impact on the economy in the event that construction were to halt. It’s just not big enough.Furthermore, there are offsets to a weak office sector. In short, the weaker it is, the stronger residential and remote work related sectors will be, because the underlying source of the disruption to the office sector is technology, which is driving a shift in working patterns.
14
Technological shocks usually aren’t recessionary or detrimental to aggregate demand, but they do create winners and losers.
In 2017, we made this
same point
with regard to the pervasive concerns at the time about brick and mortar retail assets: Throughout the 2010s, as overall GDP in the retail sector continued to rise, more of it went to e-commerce platforms while brick and mortar shrank. The upshot is that this shift represented a micro recession for brick and mortar retail, but not a macro recession for either the retail sector as a whole or the overall economy.
Small bank lending channel could potentially impact GDP
We feel confident that the office sector isn’t likely, in isolation, to be a significant source of GDP weakness. But broader and legitimate concerns about confidence in the banking system are relevant, especially questions about smaller banks and the credit they provide to the broader economy.
Inevitably, the latest spate of banking stress is a negative for economic growth because it will likely result in less bank lending. Quantifying that impact is no easy task, because the Fed will—in all likelihood—try to offset the impact of reduced lending via less restrictive monetary policy (larger, better capitalized banks may step in to fill the void as well).
From an equities and credit perspective, we are cautious on the regional banking sector. As mentioned previously, these banks have approximately 4.4 times more exposure to CRE than large banks do. In the chart below, we show CRE exposure, excluding lower risk segments (owner-occupied properties, multifamily), as a proxy for higher risk categories (offices and vintage malls). We map each bank’s exposure as a percentage of its capital. While total exposure to the weakest CRE subsectors varies by bank, those with more than 100% of their capital in these buckets are more likely to be smaller regional entities.Market participants are trying to address a key concern: Will the potential stress in segments of the CRE market negatively impact earnings for regional banks—and create such significant drag for some that their capital could be impaired? Several factors will drive the outcome: the size of the banks’ exposure, the magnitude of their losses across vulnerable CRE sectors and the severity and speed of those losses.
Applying historical loss rates drawn from the GFC to office and retail holdings only, the impact in CRE would likely not rise to the level of a capital event for the banking industry. But we don’t yet know whether future losses will be confined to office and retail, or whether they will broaden. Our view is constructive: We see stronger fundamentals outside of office buildings and vintage malls, and we expect few losses beyond these two vulnerable CRE segments.
For a worst-case scenario, we need look no further than the Fed’s most recent industry-wide Dodd Frank Act stress test. In this exercise, the impact of a “severely adverse” market scenario would result in a 40% drop in aggregate CRE prices (i.e., a collapse in values that would not be confined to office properties and vintage malls). In this projection, the degree of capital erosion would be considerably more severe, with capital shortfalls likely becoming pervasive across the regional banking sector.
Clearly, this scenario is meant to represent an extremely bearish outcome for the U.S. economy—and does not represent our base case—but it does help answer the question “How bad could this possibly get?” Our base case assumes that aggregate CRE prices fall approximately 10%–15% in the current cycle (although for the office sector, we wouldn’t be surprised to see price declines of 30%–40% in the most stressed markets).
Investment implications
What does this mean for your portfolio? The trouble in the office sector—and its potential impact on bank lending and profitability—will contribute to an elevated probability of recession in the U.S. this year. In the portfolios we manage, we have been adding to assets that can help weather a downturn should one occur (e.g., core fixed income), while maintaining a balance across asset classes.
Within publicly traded real estate, the office sector has been one of the most popular shorts for the market since COVID-19 hit and prices already reflect material weakness. Some publicly traded REITs that focus on the industrial sector are also getting caught up in the turmoil, and we think they are approaching attractive entry points for investors who have less exposure to the space.
On the private side, the managers that we work with have limited exposure to U.S. office buildings, and opportunities may start to appear for specialists in distressed real estate in the coming quarters and years.

This technological shock (remote work) is also a source of the bifurcation in the office sector between newer builds and older vintages. Amid the war for labor talent, companies have tried to use newer office space in prime locations as a way to lure employees back into the office.The chart describes vacancy and available rates and the gap between vacancy and available rates.   The vacancy rate line started at 10.22% in March 2006 and peaked at 12.88% in September 2010 before coming down and bottomed at 9.44% in June 2019. Then it went higher again and ended the series at 12.48% in December 2022.  The available rate line started at 11.6% in March 2006 and peaked at 16.07% in June 2010 before coming down to a low of 12.25% in September 2019. It ended on a higher note at 15.95% in December 2022.  For the availability-vacancy rate gap, the first data point came in at 1.38% in March 2006, it climbed until it peaked at 3.23% in June 2009. Then it fluctuated near that level until the latest data point at 3.47% in December 2022.The chart describes the share of hours worked remotely since 2000 to 2022.   The first data point came in at 1.7% in 2000 after which it trended slightly higher all the way until it reached 4.7% in 2019 before skyrocketing to the peak at 46.3% in 2020 before falling to the latest data point at 30.3% in 2022.The chart describes cumulative liquidations since 2002.  Cumulative liquidations started at 0% in February 2002 then gradually climbed higher until the latest data point at 20.43% in January 2023.The chart describes a cap rate valuation analysis. In the column on the left, the valuation is for a total of $100mn in which $65mn is debt and $35mn is equity. In the table below the column, the left side describes the scenario if cap rate is 4.5%. In this Original Loan situation, net operating income is $4.5mn whereas the value is $100mn. In the column on the right, the valuation is for a total of $72mn in which $46.8mn is debt, $18.2mn is rescue capital, and $7.0mn is equity. In the table below the column, the right side describes the scenario if cap rate is 6.25%. In this Pro-forma Refinance situation, net operating income is $4.5mn whereas the value is $72mn. On the top right of the chart, there is also an equation describing: Property Value = Net Operating Income (NOI)/ Cap Rate Next to the right-side column, there are two textboxes saying: 1. Additional Capital Old – New Loan ($65mn - $46.8mn) 2. New Loan Amount (65% * $72mn).This chart shows the return components of the NCREIF Property Index (NPI) on a quarterly basis from Q1 2021 through Q2 2022. The returns components shown include net operating income (NOI) yield, capital expenditures (capex), NOI growth, cap rate change, and interaction. The quarterly total return is shown in a separate line overlaying the components. Total return began in Q1 2021 at 1.5% and gradually climbed until it peaked at 5.9% in Q4 2021. From there it gradually fell until it reached a low point of -3.5% in Q4 2022, the most recent data point. In terms of the components, NOI growth was a large positive contributing factor in every quarter. Cap rate change was also a large positive contributing factor through Q1 2022. Starting in Q2 2022, the return from cap rate change dropped below zero and became increasingly negative. By Q4 2022, the cap rate change alone contributed to a negative 6.14% percent in total return.The chart describes the CRE price index vs real GDP from 1986 to 1995.  The real GDP started at 8231.7 in December 1986 and trended upward until the last data point at 10637.0 in December 1995.  The CRE price index started at 96.5 in December 1986 and went up and peaked at 108.7 in December 1989 before bottoming at 86.7 in December 1993. Then it bounced back to 91.1 in December 1995.The chart describes commercial real estate vacancy rates from 2007 to 2022.  For office, the vacancy line started at 10.04% in Q1 2007 and peaked at 12.88% in Q3 2010. Later it declined to a bottom of 9.44% in Q2 2019 before bouncing back to the height of 12.48% in Q4 2022.

Market update
It ain’t 2022 anymore
Perhaps the clearest sign that markets have moved on from 2022 is that not even the latest Consumer Price Inflation data could cause much of a ruckus.
After the release suggested a relatively ho-hum increase in prices (0.4% for core, 0.1% for headline on the month), investors shifted focus to the upcoming earnings season, hoping to learn more about the state of bank deposits, consumer spending and technology turnaround efforts.
The returns we have seen stand in stark contrast to 2022’s risk-off environment. From their respective lows, Bitcoin has surged almost 100%, Chinese internet companies have gained over 70%, mega-cap tech stocks are up nearly 50%, and even the ARKK Innovation ETF, which shed two-thirds of its value in 2022, has bounced by 33%. The best stock in the S&P 500 this year (NVIDIA) is up over 80%. In 2022, it lost 50%.
European equities are close to all-time highs, and core bonds have provided a workmanlike 3.5% return. The U.S. dollar is close to its lowest levels in a year.
The most valuable players in portfolios last year were short-term Treasuries. This year, most major asset classes are outpacing T-bills. Energy and commodities, the other 2022 standouts, have also lagged.
We welcome the vibe shift in markets, but there is no shortage of debate about what the rest of the year has in store. In today’s note, we review the case that both bulls and bears make for the path forward, then provide our take.
Spotlight
Bull vs. Bear
The U.S. economy
The bears
have a lot of evidence they need to make their calls for a U.S. recession. Rate hikes have consequences after all. The failure of Silicon Valley and Signature Banks may not have led to a crisis of confidence, but the problems for bank profitability and credit availability may just be getting started. Small businesses are already reporting that credit is harder to find, the
office real estate sector
will likely have a material distress cycle, given higher interest and vacancy rates, and continuing jobless claims are starting to signal cracks in the labor market.The bulls
still
have a decent case to make. Wage inflation seems well on its way to normalization without any rise in the unemployment rate, which seems to settle one of the key macroeconomic debates of the last 18 months. Even though strains are just starting in the office sector, the residential housing market is showing tentative signs of turning a corner. Housing market sentiment and home sales are tentatively perking up.
Our take
is that it still seems like a recession is more likely than not, but a softer landing is possible. We will be watching closely for signs that the credit crunch from March is having a sustained negative impact through the spring.
The global economy
The bears
on the global economy seem to be worried about geopolitical risks, energy crises, an unpredictable war and unresolved trade issues between the United States and China. It makes sense to keep a keen focus on all of these unresolved issues that threaten economic growth and stability. In fact, our Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon spent time discussing them in his latest
letter to shareholders
. The biggest risks facing the global economy outside the United States are probably not endemic to the business cycle, but are still very important to monitor.
The bulls
seem to have the upper hand here. Global Purchasing Manager Indices, which offer a real-time indication of business activity, are at their highest levels since last summer and have had a tremendous bounce since last fall. A weaker dollar helps grease the wheels of global trade, and China’s reopening continues to provide a boost. Louis Vuitton helped drive the French stock market to an all-time high this week after strong sales in China.Our take
is that growth prospects outside the United States look better than they do inside the United States. This means the dollar is likely to continue to weaken, and investors should look to European and Chinese stock markets, which could continue to perform well.
The bond market
The bears
on bonds have a simple case: The economy is still chugging along and inflation is still at ~5%. It doesn’t make much sense for yields to fall (and bond prices to rise) as long as growth remains resilient and inflation stays sticky.
The bulls
say markets only have ~80 basis points (bps) of interest rate cuts priced in over the next 12 months. In the average recession back to the 1950s, the Federal Reserve has cut by an average of ~300 bps (excluding Volcker’s 1980 campaign). In a recession, Fed cuts will likely be deep, and price gains in core bonds could be steep.Our take
if our base case on the economy plays out is that we could be in for much lower interest rates (and higher bond prices) over the next 12–18 months. However, for the tactical investor, there may be better entry points in the weeks ahead.
The stock market
The bears
point to the ominous U.S. economic backdrop to justify their view that stocks should head lower. Valuations also seem to be embedding a high degree of confidence in a relatively benign earnings outcome. The forward P/E multiple of the S&P 500 is above 18x again, and the spread between what you can yield from earnings and what you can get from corporate bonds is the tightest of the last 10 years.
The bulls
suggest the earnings recession that we have been in is set to end after this quarter. After that, consensus expectations call for earnings growth to quickly bounce back to a low teens pace by the end of the year. Beyond the fundamentals, positioning seems short, which could set the market up for a squeeze higher if we have an upside surprise this earnings season.
Our take
is that neither are right. Instead, we expect choppy, rangebound trading through the rest of the year. Certain sectors (healthcare, industrials and reasonably priced tech) and sizes (mid-caps) may outperform, but at an index level, we are pretty close to where we think the market will likely end the year.
Takeaways
Back to reality
The hardest part about 2022 was that barely any investments worked.
What we have learned so far this year is that 2022’s environment of boiling inflation and aggressive interest rate hikes is in the rearview mirror.
The debate between bulls and bears will continue, but investors should take comfort in the idea that assets are doing what they need them to do to achieve long-term success. Equities drive long-term growth. Bonds provide stability and security. Alternatives allow for the potential to outperform public markets and access unique opportunities.

https://privatebank.jpmorgan.com/gl/en/insights/planning/tax-deferral-can-sometimes-be-a-costly-mistake,"TaxesTax deferral can sometimes be a costly mistakeauthors:- Amanda Lottpublished Date:- Apr 18, 2023Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.
Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.You could unnecessarily pay almost double in taxes if you don’t defer with care. Be sure to put the right assets in the right types of accounts.Contrary to the common assumption, deferring taxes is
not
always a good idea.
We caution against what many people routinely do: automatically opt for tax-deferred accounts. They usually do so because they assume their ordinary income tax rate will be lower after they retire. Or they think: “Even if my tax rate won’t be lower, it’s better to put it off for as long as possible.”
They can be wrong on both points.
People are often surprised to find they are still subject to top U.S. tax rates when they no longer draw a high salary but have significant assets. Also, and critically: Very few people realize that financial outcomes can be significantly different when you put pre-tax versus after-tax dollars into tax-deferred accounts.
Yes, it’s usually a good move to put
pre
-tax dollars into tax-deferred accounts. So, if you can, it’s often wise to take advantage of any deferred compensation plans and make
pre
-tax contributions to traditional 401(k)s, up to the maximum allowed.
1
But the minute you are talking about
after
-tax dollars, we believe you should be careful (with, for example, your non-deductible contributions to IRAs and non-qualified annuities).
2
Choosing tax deferral for the wrong reasons—or with the wrong assets—could mean you wind up paying almost double the tax rate.
There’s no need for you to make costly mistakes. Here’s what you might do instead.
You may
always
be subject to the highest ordinary income tax rate
First, check: Do you know what your tax bracket will be in the future, after tallying your Social Security, required minimum distributions (RMDs) and other sources of taxable income?
Many people don’t realize that—even after retirement—they could be subject to the highest tax brackets that today, at the federal level, are 35% and 37% (the latter for annual income of about $694,000 for a couple and $578,000 for an individual).
There are state and local taxes, too. And in the future, the top federal rate is scheduled to revert to 39.6% in 2026, when some provisions in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act sunset.
For people with wealth, today’s top thresholds can be quickly met.
Say you have a $30 million portfolio that generates an annual yield of just 2%. That would produce $600,000 of income a year before any capital gains you might realize through rebalancing and prudent portfolio management.
Then assume Social Security (of about $45,000 per person) and required minimum distributions from you and your spouse’s $2 million IRAs (the most common sources of retirement income), and that’s another $250,000 in income for a married couple filing jointly with two retired workers.
3
The result: You might no longer be drawing a salary, but you’d still be subject to the highest tax rates in effect today.
When to choose taxable accounts and pay as you go
So let’s say you’ll be subject to the highest income tax rate in the future. The next things to understand are the tax implications of tax-deferred accounts. While taxes are deferred until the future, keep in mind:
All withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts are taxed as ordinary income
You can’t use the assets in tax-deferred accounts for tax-loss harvesting
The assets in tax-deferred accounts don’t receive a step-up in cost basis at death
Given this, when could a
taxable
account make more sense? Answer: Much more often than most people assume when after-tax dollars are involved.
You may want to pay taxes as you go, keeping after-tax dollars in taxable accounts if:
You can get preferential tax treatment on their return
—i.e.,
you can pay the 23.8% tax rate for long-term-capital gains (LTCG) or qualified dividend income (QDI).
4
This approach might be wise even if you expect that investment to have a high return, as long as the majority of that return is from LTCG or QDI (think S&P 500 exchange-traded funds or private equity)
You want to harvest tax losses
—i.e.,
you want to realize investment losses to offset your gains and reduce your annual tax burden (regular tax-loss harvesting can be particularly advantageous when markets are volatile)
You want to leave those assets to family members
—Assets in taxable accounts get a “reset” in cost basis at death, meaning that your heirs will not owe taxes on all of the appreciation you achieved since first acquiring the asset. The same is not the case for tax-deferred accounts, as human beneficiaries also inherit an embedded tax liability with those assets
5
Making the right choice can make a sizable financial difference
What happens when you put a so-called “tax-efficient investment” (one in which the return profile is predominantly from QDI and LTCG) into a tax-deferred account? Instead of paying 23.8% along the way, you’d pay nearly double in taxes on the funds—37%—when you finally make withdrawals.
How much would you then have to earn annually so that the amount you’d receive from the tax-deferred account would equal how much you’d get from the taxable account? A large—and largely unrealistic—rate of return would be essential. That’s true even in places where you would have to pay a higher rate (such as New York City).
6For a resident of Texas (where there are no state income taxes) to have the same value in hand after 20 years, the tax-efficient investment would have to earn 11.5% annually in the tax-deferred account.
When does it still make sense to opt for tax deferral?
There are five main reasons to put your after-tax dollars into tax-deferred accounts:
1. The investments are “tax-inefficient” (i.e., their return does not qualify for the 23.8% tax rate as LTCG or QDI)
—Such investments could include high yield bonds, private credit, actively traded equity strategies that generate significant short-term capital gains, and some hedge funds.
72. You want to trade without any immediate tax consequences
—For example, say you had a $30 million portfolio, including a $3 million tax-deferred account. You could buy and sell investments in the tax-deferred account without having to recognize any gains. The goal could be to use this tax-deferred account, and the investments within, as a counterbalance for your broader portfolio (e.g., have all $3 million in stocks when valuations are cheap and then move to all fixed income when equity valuations become frothy).
3. Your ordinary income tax rate will be significantly lower in the future
—Even if your U.S. tax rate might remain high, your state taxes would be lower if you moved from a high-income-tax state like New York to a no-income-tax state like Florida.
4. You plan to convert a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA in the near future
—Any after-tax contributions would not be subject to tax upon conversion, and once in a Roth IRA, any future growth pulled out through qualified distributions will be tax-free.
8
5. The assets are earmarked for charity
—As the charity won’t have to pay any taxes on these assets, there is no reason for you to do so.
We can help
Where to put which investments is obviously a complex question—but well worth considering carefully. Your J.P. Morgan team is available to work with you and your tax advisors to help you make sure your decisions truly support your long-term goals.
1
In 2023, the maximum amount of pre
-
tax dollars you can put into a 401(k) is $22,500. If you are over 50 years old, another $7,500 is allowed (so $30,000).
2
If an individual is covered by an employer retirement plan, no deduction is allowed for a contribution to a traditional IRA if Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) is above modest thresholds ($83,000 for single or head of household taxpayer, and $136,000 for those married and filing jointly).
3
In 2023, maximum annual Social Security benefit at full retirement age is $43,524 annually and could be higher if an individual delays until age 70.
4
Includes the 3.8% Medicare surtax on net investment income.
5
In contrast, tax-deferred accounts always pass on an embedded tax liability in the form of “income in respect of a decedent” (i.e., the untaxed income that a decedent had earned or had a right to receive during their lifetime). IRD is taxed to the individual beneficiary or entity that inherits this income.
6
This isn’t to say holding a tax-efficient investment in a tax-deferred account is always the wrong decision; however, there could be a more optimal location for it if you have taxable accounts in your portfolio.
7
Given that hedge funds are a broad asset class, the investor will need to review the strategy of the hedge fund to determine if the return generated would likely be treated as ordinary income via interest and short-term capital gains. If a hedge fund is classified as a 475(f) hedge fund, returns will generally be treated as ordinary income, and thus would be deemed tax-inefficient.
8
Distributions from a Roth IRA are considered qualified distributions if you are 59½ or older, and the account is at least five years old. Qualified distributions are tax- and penalty-free.Analysis is for 10 to 30 years with an initial $1M investment. This table illustrates the annualized return a low turnover equity investment would need in a tax-deferred account to breakeven with the same investment held in a taxable account when considered on an after-tax basis. The analysis compares three scenarios, a U.S. taxpayer with no additional product fee for tax deferral, a NYC taxpayer with no additional fee and a NYC taxpayer with an additional 0.3% tax-deferral product fee. The first two traditional IRA scenarios are not subject to the additional 3.8% Medicare surtax. Each scenario calculates the required return a low turnover equity investment would need in a tax-deferred account to breakeven with a taxable account across 10, 20 or 30 years. Required annualized returns range from 5.5-42%. U.S. tax assumptions include: 43.4% ordinary income for annuity withdrawals, 39.6% for IRA withdrawals, and 23.8% Qualified Dividend Income and long-term capital gains tax rate for the taxable account. New York City tax assumptions include: 49.62% ordinary income for annuity withdrawals, 45.82% for IRA withdrawals, and 30.02% Qualified Dividend Income and long-term capital gains tax rate for the taxable account. Tax rates listed are for the majority of years in the analysis and are projected based on current tax laws. Analysis assumes that of total return, 2% is yield, 100% is taxed as QDI, and the remaining return is capital appreciation subject to 30% turnover, with 100% of gains realized taxed as long-term.Analysis is for 30 years with an initial $1MM investment and assumes highest U.S. federal tax bracket. This chart projects the growth of high-yield bonds in a taxable and tax-deferred account on an after-tax basis. The tax-deferred account is assumed to be an IRA, and the distribution is not subject to the additional 3.8% Medicare surtax. Comparing the two scenarios, high-yield bonds in a tax-deferred account surpass the taxable account in year one. After 30 years, this increase in market value is forecast to be $1.8 million, a meaningful difference just by holding a tax inefficient investment in the right place.

U.S. tax assumptions include: 43.4% ordinary income for taxable account, 39.6% for IRA withdrawals, and 23.8% Qualified Dividend Income and long-term capital gains tax rate. Tax rates listed are for the majority of years in the analysis and are projected based on current tax laws. Analysis uses J.P. Morgan Long-Term Capital Market Assumptions for high-yield bonds with total return of 6.8%, 7.85% yield, 100% of income taxed as ordinary income, 60% turnover, with 100% of appreciation taxed as long-term capital gains.Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Summer brings sun, fun and relaxation, but it can also bring scammers. When planning your vacation, be sure to leave these SPFs—scams, phonies and frauds—behind.Nadia Manara, Global Fraud Awareness
With summer right around the corner, you may be anticipating an upcoming vacation. No doubt you have taken the time to plan and prepare for the trip, but be on guard for scammers who are looking to upend your plans. Last year, the
Federal Trade Commission
reported consumers lost nearly $104 million in travel scams.

Even for experienced travelers, scams can be notoriously hard to spot. To stay safe this summer, remain alert when you set out, and seek to verify any information you’re given to avoid these three common scenarios:
“Payment please!”
After checking into your hotel and settling into your room, you receive a phone call from someone at “the front desk.” The caller says your payment method was declined and requests another form of payment over the phone. Before you share any information—stop! The call could be from a fraudster. Instead, go to the front desk personally to address any potential issues.
Home away from home?
Watch out for fake property listings. Fraudsters create lookalike sites offering rentals that may not exist, are already booked or significantly differ from what was advertised. Often, you are urged to reserve quickly via an unsecured payment method or person-to-person payment platform, such as Zelle®. Always call the company on a known number to verify payment details verbally before sending funds.
Fun in the sun.
One of the best parts of a vacation is all the adventure that comes with it. When booking activities and excursions, double-check the provider’s legitimacy, and—if possible—organize your outings though your hotel. Just like when renting lodging, you risk having no recorded reservation if you book with an unknown provider—or no excursion at all.
Five best practices so you and yours may enjoy a fraud-free family vacation
Fortunately, you can take several steps to reduce the likelihood of being targeted by scammers on your summer holiday. As you plan your next adventure, be sure to think about following these top-five security tips:
Use secure payment channels.
Wiring money or sending it as a person-to-person transaction exposes you to risk because the funds usually cannot be recalled. Instead, pay with a credit card or utilize a secure payment platform.
Identify reputable companies or websites.
Protect yourself when booking your plans. Beware of deals offered on social media or through advertisements that seem too good to be true. They probably are.
Do your research.
Investigate the listing organization and property; look for online reviews, complaints or spoofed (lookalike) websites.
Monitor your accounts.
Review your transactions periodically and enable online alerts to receive notifications of potential unauthorized activity. Remember to report fraud immediately.
Protect your own profile
: As a basic safety rule, it’s always important to limit the information you and your family members share on social media to reduce the risk of becoming a target.

Dan Alter, Mortgage Solutions Team Lead
The end of the U.S. housing market’s pandemic-induced volatility seems in sight.
A recent and telling stabilization of single-family home sales—surprising in the face of high mortgage rates—has us expecting prices to finish bottoming out across the nation by the end of this year or in early 2024.
By the second half of 2024, we believe, the national housing market will return to a pre-pandemic historical norm in which residential home prices climb slowly and steadily, keeping modestly ahead of the rate of inflation.
1
However, we also expect each city’s path back to normalcy to be very different.
What do all these factors add up to for buyers and sellers? We think it would be helpful to:
Understand that the current, ahistorical housing market favors neither buyers nor sellers.
Buyers may benefit from timing the continuing downturn, but prices are only coming down from inflated pandemic-inspired highs—and the stock of existing homes is still in (mostly) short supply.
Know that valuations may slip, but the slide could be limited.
Sellers, for their part, may see their home valuations dip further through the course of this year. But, again due to limited supply, the market bottom may not be as low as they fear.
Do your homework.
Keep in mind that there are significant nuances to each area’s housing markets in the best of times—and these are strange days indeed. So whether you are a buyer or seller, it is important to gather as much information as possible about ongoing trends at the national and local levels.
The nation’s housing market has begun to stabilize
The COVID-19 housing upheaval began in March 2020 when lockdowns inspired people to move out of densely populated urban areas in favor of areas with larger homes better suited to remote work.
Many local housing markets saw dramatic price surges. For the nation as a whole, home prices rose a startling 39% from June 2020 to August 2022—igniting fears that a new housing bubble was emerging.
As inflation also started to rise significantly, the Federal Reserve responded by instituting the fastest series of interest rate hikes in the past 40 years. In 2022, the Fed drove its policy rate interest rate from 0% to 4.5%, with the 30-year fixed mortgage rate rising from 3% to a peak of more than 7% by the fall.
These interest rate increases quickly deflated the nascent housing bubble in the United States, where market activity plummeted last year as mortgage rates spiked. Now, though, we’re seeing some tentative but clear signs that suggest this period of intense volatility may soon be ending, and that stability may be on the horizon. Pending sales of existing homes recently ticked up. Moreover, homebuilders’ confidence about future sales (a leading indicator) is on the rise.
2A housing recovery may come by 2024
These recent, positive indicators are a little surprising, given the 30-year mortgage rate remains at levels (6% to 7%) that many would have thought too high to promote any stability.
Today’s improvement seems to be due in large part to the fact there are nationally too few single-family homes relative to population pressures. The good news is, these drivers may continue to act as guardrails for the U.S. housing market:
Demand
—More than 30% of young people aged 18 to 34 are still living at home with their parents, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Meanwhile, millennials (aged 27–42 in 2023) form the largest generation group in the United States at approximately 72 million. The effort of all these young adults to own homes creates a source of demand that is likely going to be a theme for years into the future.
Supply
—Meanwhile, there’s a shortage of housing stock. Since the bursting of the 2008 housing bubble, new home development in the United States has lagged demand. We estimate that today, this gap totals approximately 2-2.5 million too few housing units. And the recent spike in mortgage rates is, counterintuitively, exacerbating this shortage, as homeowners who refinanced when rates dipped are now disincentivized to move and take a new mortgage at a higher rate (2020 had the largest number of refinances on record; 2021 had the third highest, trailing only 2003).
3
We think these drivers will not only cushion how low prices will go over the next year, but can also help shorten the lag between the transaction trough, when sales activity bottoms out, and when prices follow to their nadir.
4
Right now, aggregate home prices are down about 4-5% from the national peak in 2022. We believe aggregate home prices will decline, on average, about 10% from peak to trough when the pandemic’s full fallout is complete.
In other words, we expect the decline to be smaller and come sooner than the crash the U.S. housing market experienced after the 2008 Financial Crisis, when single-family home values depreciated by about 30% from peak to trough. That nadir came a full two-and-a-half years after buying activity bottomed out in late 2008.
Also, unlike the 2008 crisis that depressed home prices fairly uniformly across the country, the amount of volatility an individual city is experiencing depends largely on each locale’s unique market dynamics.
Cities are on very different paths back to normal
Last fall
, as the housing market was cooling, we said that national statistics, while informative, would fail to tell the whole story. We expected cities to experience widely differing drops in home prices based in large part on how overheated their particular housing markets were at the start of 2022, before interest rates rose.
Subsequent home price drops have been dispersed, and in the general direction we anticipated.To see “why” there has been great variety among local housing markets, we think it is instructive to compare and contrast Austin (a city to which remote workers ran during the pandemic) and New York City (one they fled).
When this historically anomalous chapter in the U.S. housing market is finally closed, we expect Austin to have experienced greater price volatility, with a peak-to-trough decline of 15% to 20%. Yet the price drops in Austin sow the seeds for more affordable homes over the long term than in New York, where we expect prices to experience less volatility (probably a 5% to 10% peak-to-trough decline).
The key reasons for these differences are due to demand and supply drivers, which generally apply to any city.
In Texas as a whole, but Austin especially, there has been a quick and substantial supply response to the pandemic-sparked surge in demand for large homes with space for remote work.
5
Today, Austin’s inventory is 10%–15%
above
its level before COVID-19 hit. This rapid response in supply can help keep prices in Austin affordable over the long term.
By contrast, New York’s inventory (much of it space-constrained) is currently significantly below (30%– 40%) its pre-pandemic level. Interestingly, Bridgeport, Connecticut, and its environs (suburbs of New York City) have seen even less of a supply response, with inventory currently about 60% below their pre-pandemic levels!Supply deficits in New York (and the surrounding metropolitan region) restrict how much home prices can fall—even as buying activity has slowed considerably. Over the past year, single-family home sales in New York have declined about 38%.
On the flip side, the Big Apple’s inability to build quickly to meet demand—stymied as it is by more regulations, greater regulatory fees and higher labor costs—might continue to stifle its affordability.
One long-term effect of these dynamics can be a continuation of population shifts away from less affordable cities like New York and toward places like Austin. First-time home buyers and young adults in particular won’t wait for supply dynamics to improve in cities like New York; they’ll keep opting for more affordable metro areas that increasingly offer attractive job prospects—and in many cases, a more temperate climate.Let’s talk about your city

For the 50 years prior to the pandemic, existing home prices grew about 5% a year (one percentage point above inflation), a result, we believe, of population growth and scarcity of land.

Zonda National Builder Survey asked: “How is January (2023) shaping up so far for your local operation in comparison to your expectations?”; 37% of the 150 to 200 respondents (larger, publicly traded builders) said “stronger than expected” and 36% said “on track,” while only 13% said “slower…but not worrisome” and 14% said “slower…and causing concern.” Importantly, in the same survey, 51% said they saw a positive response by consumers to the drop in mortgage rates from 7% to 6% in January.

There is anecdotal evidence suggesting developers are offering substantial closing cost credits and funding buyers’ mortgage rate buydowns to move their excess stock. However, new housing completions make up less than 1% of the total housing stock annually. So the overall housing market remains in a state of shortage, even though some builders may have some excess new inventories they are trying to reduce. Sources: Bloomberg and J.P. Morgan.

These two variables, size and remote share, were key drivers of housing demand across U.S. cities when the pandemic first began. To illustrate, we ran a multivariate regression with these two variables (while also controlling for population growth) against our z-score metric on housing valuation at the city level. The r-square of the regression was 0.42, with both variables of interest (size and remote share) being statistically significant and carrying a positive sign on the estimated coefficients.Pending new home sales in the U.S. ticked up slightly at the start of 2023. This line graph shows an index of US Pending Home Sales (indexed 2001 to 100). The graph ticks up in 2023, showing the increase in new home sales.Using historical analysis of median home price to median home income ratios of select U.S. metros, we provide a valuation metric of the local housing markets of these metros. This list ranks a select group of metros by this valuation metric (z-score) with metros with lower z-scores (& thus not as overvalued) at the top and higher z-scores (more overvalued) at the bottom.The scatter plot plots the metros in the table above by 2021 valuation z-score (x-axis) and the % change in median home price from peak post-COVID value to December 2022. The graph illustrates the relationship between the z-score and accompanying price change with an R^2 of 36%.This line graph shows housing inventory in Austin, Texas, New York City, New York and Bridgeport, Connecticut (12 month rolling average, indexed December 2019 = 100). The line representing Austin, Texas rises significantly post 2021, showing the ramp up in inventory in the city, while inventory in New York and Bridgeport lag.This line graph shows the populations of New York state and Texas since 2013. As shown, the population of New York has declined while the population of Texas continues to rise.Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.A guide for non-UK resident clients on some of the key tax and other planning considerations“When a man is tired of London, he is tired of life; for there is in London all that life can afford”, Samuel Johnson“This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England”, Act II, Scene I, Richard II, William ShakespeareThe UK continues to be a destination of choice for people seeking to purchase residential property. With its depth of culture and breadth of business opportunities, plus its convenient time zone and fantastic education options, many seek properties as permanent homes, holiday or seasonal homes; others as places to stay whilst doing business, or as investment opportunities.As in many countries, in the past decade there have been numerous and significant changes to the way the UK government taxes residential property. The global trend has been for the tax burden on residential property to increase, and the UK is no exception. In the UK, broadly speaking the government has used tax as a way to discourage indirect ownership and to increase transparency around who ultimately owns residential property. These trends are likely to continue.It is therefore as important as ever that you take both the right conveyancing and legal advice as well as tax advice in advance of your purchase.
This note highlights some of the basic tax and legal considerations that form part of residential property purchases in the UK. It should act as an introduction to the topic to help inform your detailed discussions with your independent tax and legal advisors.The legal process
1
Once you have found a property you are interested in, the process of acquiring it can be exciting and it is certainly a process worth being prepared for.
There are two key principles to note. First, you will not be legally bound to acquire a property until you exchange contracts with the vendor. The bulk of the work relating to a purchase is completed before the exchange of contracts. You will have to pay a deposit on exchange of contracts.
The second key principle is ‘caveat emptor’, or ‘let the buyer beware’. This is the legal principle that it is your responsibility as the buyer to investigate and discover everything you need to know about the property before you purchase it. This work is undertaken by your conveyancer/lawyer who will undertake pre-contract searches with, among others, the Local Authority, make enquiries of the vendor and investigate the property’s title. You will need to instruct a surveyor to undertake a survey of the property itself.
On the one hand, this process provides you with the flexibility to change your mind about purchasing the property – say, if you find something out about it that cannot be addressed as part of your commercial negotiations. On the other, it means that you will incur costs in learning about the property before you and the vendor are bound to transact.Freehold or leasehold?
In the UK there are two main forms of home ownership, freehold or leasehold. If you own a freehold house you normally own the property and the land it sits on. You are responsible for all maintenance and can make alterations to the property as you wish (subject to any planning permissions required).
If you own a leasehold, you do not own the land the property sits on. You will have to comply with any restrictions found in the lease (which is the agreement between you and the freeholder of the property). You are unlikely to be able to make structural alterations to the property and will likely have to contribute to the maintenance of the property, sometimes through a service charge. Flats are usually sold as leaseholds. The length of the lease is often 99 or 125 years and as this period reduces, the value of the leasehold is likely to reduce too. It is sometimes possible to extend a lease.
How will you fund the purchase and the deposit?
Broadly, if you are moving to the UK for the first time but continue to consider another place to be your permanent and indefinite home, you are likely to become a UK resident ‘non-domiciled’ person (a status which has a number of tax implications which you should seek UK tax advice on, alongside the advice you will receive in relation to the property purchase). You will need to consider with your UK tax advisors how best to fund the deposit due on your property purchase, together with the balance of the purchase price, in an efficient way.
Often UK resident non-domiciled individuals will have a pool of so-called clean capital that they can bring to the UK without a tax charge which they use to fund the deposit. You will need to consider with your tax advisor whether it would be tax efficient for you to take out a mortgage against the UK property (see the inheritance tax section below for more information on this).

.
UK tax advice will also be important in ensuring that any other security is required by the bank is structured appropriately with both remittance and UK inheritance tax issues in mind.
If you intend to remain non-UK resident there will be less complexity around how best to fund the deposit as there is unlikely to be a UK tax issue when bringing those funds here. However, you should still take advice on the UK inheritance tax consequences of the arrangements, together with other UK tax considerations resulting from the purchase and future sale of the property and any rental income you might receive from your tenants if you rent it out.
How will you own the property?
Once you have found the property you were looking for and have commenced the preliminary work with your conveyancer, it is worthwhile taking tax and legal advice to decide the most sensible way for you to hold the property given your personal circumstances and the objectives you have for the property. In recent years we have seen an increasing trend towards direct ownership, rather than ownership through a company, particularly where the property is intended for personal use.
There may remain some limited circumstances where corporate or trust ownership might make sense. If the property is held through a company or trust structure, the tax considerations can be complex and you should ensure that you obtain advice from a UK tax advisor.
What taxes apply to the acquisition and disposal of UK residential property?
Inheritance tax
The main exposure to UK inheritance tax for non-UK residents and non-UK domiciled individuals will often be as a result of their ownership of UK residential property. This is often a key area that they wish to seek tax advice on.
Even if you do not intend to become resident in the UK, if you buy a residential property here it will be within the scope of inheritance tax. Inheritance tax is charged at 40% on death on the value of all of a non-UK domiciled individual’s UK situated assets (whether or not they are UK resident). Debts owed by the individual may reduce the amount exposed to inheritance tax in some circumstances.
It should be noted that property passing between spouses is generally exempt from inheritance tax (subject to certain limitations where the property passes to the surviving spouse and they are a non-UK domiciled individual).
Your exposure to inheritance tax in the UK can be mitigated by securing a mortgage against the property upon acquisition. In addition, you might consider life insurance to cover any inheritance tax exposure in respect of the equity you own in the property.
Stamp Duty Land Tax (“SDLT”)
You will pay SDLT on the acquisition of residential property in your own name in England or Northern Ireland.
2
From 23 September 2022,
3
the standard rates of SDLT payable by purchasers who are individuals purchasing a single property are:
4If you are buying your first home
You can claim a relief if the property you are purchasing is your first home. The effect of the relief is that you’ll pay:
no SDLT up to £425,000,
5% SLDT on the portion from £425,001 - £625,000.
This relief is only available if you and anyone else you are purchasing with are first-time buyers, and the price you are paying for the property is under £625,000. If the price of the property is over £625,000 you follow the standard SDLT rules.
It should be noted that the above rules were amended to be a temporary reduction in the Autumn Statement 2022. These rules are due to remain in place until 31
st
March 2025.  They will will then revert to the previous rules.
5
Additional 3% SDLT Rate
An additional 3% charge is added to the standard rate of SDLT if the UK property you are purchasing is in addition to another residential property you already own anywhere else in the world.
This additional 3% surcharge will not apply if you are replacing your main home on the same day.
If you do not sell your former main home on the same day as you acquire your new UK property, you will be required to pay the additional 3% SDLT charge, but you will have up to three years to sell your former home if you wish to reclaim the additional tax.  Once it is sold, you can reclaim the additional 3% SDLT charge.
The purchaser and their spouse or civil partner are treated as one person for the purposes of the additional 3% rate.  So if your spouse owns a residential property anywhere else in the world and you are purchasing the new UK residential property, you will be treated as one person and the additional 3% SDLT charge will still apply.2% non-UK resident surcharge
An additional 2% SDLT surcharge on non-UK residents purchasing residential property in England and Northern Ireland was brought in on 1 April 2021. This will in effect mean that if you are purchasing a UK property that will not be your main home (i.e. you already own another property), you will pay the 2% non-UK resident surcharge plus the 3% SDLT charge on the purchase of additional homes. In this example, the top rate of SDLT on the value of your property purchase above £1.5 million will be 17%.
15% flat SDLT rate on corporate ownership
If you buy a property through a company, and that property is worth more than £500,000, a flat rate of 15% SDLT will apply. There are some limited exemptions from the flat 15% SDLT rate where, for example, the acquisition is for the purpose of letting as part of a rental business or as part of a property trading or development business.
Purchase of shares in a property holding company
If you buy the shares in a property holding company, you will not pay SDLT. However, there are a number of potential downsides to acquiring the shares in a property holding company that you should explore with your tax and legal advisors, not least, the Annual Tax on Enveloped Dwellings (outlined below).
In addition, since 6 April 2017, holding UK residential property through a company provides no protection from UK inheritance tax.
Annual Tax on Enveloped Dwellings (“ATED”)
Broadly speaking, ATED is an annual tax payable by companies that own UK residential property valued at more than £500,000.
The current ATED charges are:
6There are a number of reliefs from ATED, with the two most common being where the property is let to a third party on a commercial basis (so long as the occupant is not connected to you, the owner) and where the property is part of a property trader or developer’s business.
Capital gains tax (CGT)
CGT is payable by all UK resident individuals and (since 6 April 2015) non-UK resident individuals at 28% on any gains realised on the disposal of UK residential property.
Having said that, relief from CGT is available under the Principal Private Residence Relief (“PPR”) on gains arising on the disposal by gift or sale of your only or main residence. This relief is available to individuals but not to companies.
You are able to nominate which of your properties should benefit from PPR within two years of the date from which you owned more than one residence.
The period of ownership begins on date of acquisition (or on 31 March 1982 if that is later) and ends on disposal. Provided the residence has qualified for PPR at some point, the final 9 months of ownership automatically qualifies for PPR regardless of use.
In practice, if you are non-UK tax resident, it may be difficult for you to benefit from PPR. This is because in order for a property to qualify for PPR you must have spent at least 90 midnights in the tax year in the UK property or in another UK property which you own.
From 27 October 2021 onwards, both UK and non-UK residents who dispose of residential property in the UK will need to report and pay any CGT due within 60 days of completion of the transaction.
US citizens who purchase UK residential property should give careful thought to their tax position in both the US and UK.  In particular, they may be subject to US tax on any gain, in addition to any UK tax payable on the gain (if it is not fully exempt from UK tax under PPR).  However, it should be possible to credit any UK tax paid against the US tax liability to prevent double taxation of the gain.
Income tax
If you are intending to let the property, you will receive rental income in the UK which will be taxable at your marginal rate of UK income tax, regardless of whether you are UK resident or non-UK resident. A tax relief limited to the basic rate of income tax (20%) is available for an individual landlord’s mortgage interest costs in computing their taxable rental income.
Introduction of “Register of Overseas Entities” owning UK land
As part of the Economic Crime Bill, the government introduced a ‘Register of Overseas Entities’. This measure forms part of the UK Government’s strategy to tackle economic crime, and bring overseas entities owning UK property within the same rules as UK entities, which are required to disclose their beneficial owners’ identities to Companies House.
The register was launched on 1
st
August 2022, and includes severe sanctions for those who do not comply, including restrictions on buying, selling, transferring, leasing or charging their land or property in the UK.
Captured in the rules are overseas entities who want to buy, sell or transfer property or land in the UK. Also caught are overseas entities who already own or lease land or property in the UK. The deadline for these entities to register was 31
st
January 2023.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.“ JPMorgan Chase… will do its part to ensure the global economy is safe and secure.”In his letter to shareholders in the JPMorgan Chase & Co. 2022 Annual Report issued April 3, 2023, Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon offered these insights:
Across the globe, 2022 was another year of significant challenges: from a terrible war in Ukraine and growing geopolitical tensions—particularly with China—to a politically divided America. Almost all nations felt the effects of global economic uncertainty, including higher energy and food prices, mounting inflation rates and volatile markets, and, of course, COVID-19’s lingering impacts. While all these experiences and associated turmoil have serious ramifications on our company, colleagues, clients and the countries in which we do business, their consequences on the world at large—with the extreme suffering of the Ukrainian people and the potential restructuring of the global order—are far more important.
As these events unfold, America remains divided within its borders, and its global leadership role is being challenged outside of its borders. Nevertheless, this is the moment when we should put aside our differences and work with other Western nations to come together in defense of democracy and essential freedoms, including free enterprise. During other times of great crisis, we have seen America, in partnership with other countries around the globe, unite for a common cause. This is that moment again, when our country needs to work across public and private sectors to lead while improving American competitiveness—which also means re-establishing the American promise of providing equal access to opportunity for all …

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Infrastructure has the potential to provide inflation protection, income and resilience in uncertain times.Infrastructure—utilities, telecom systems and other essentials of modern society—is poised at the edge of transformational change, and you can be a part of it.
1
Emerging economies need a range of basic services, especially in fast-growing cities. Developed economies’ aging essential infrastructure, such as bridges and water utilities, need upgrades. The move toward a greener global energy future, and a more advanced and digitally connected society, needs to be built.
The capital that will be needed far surpasses governments’ capacities. Take power: Experts predict that by 2050, cities will add, on average, over two million miles of power lines and lay more than four million miles of water and sewage pipes. This is just one example of why we see the record pace of growth in the private infrastructure market accelerating further.
Infrastructure also has the potential to deliver strong investment returns. One reason is that infrastructure isn’t optional, it’s essential. We all need it all the time (when the economy is thriving and when it’s not). Moreover, returns generally don’t move the same way as stock or bond returns do, so (like other real assets) infrastructure is an uncorrelated diversifier. And since regulators peg utility rates to cost-of-living increases, there’s an embedded inflation hedge.
Meaningful inflation protection, portfolio diversification, the potential for consistent cash flow and historical outperformance in volatile times are opportunities not easily found elsewhere.
Let’s explore why we are excited about infrastructure investing.
1. Globally, infrastructure requires a massive influx of capital
As the world’s population swells by an expected two billion people by 2050, urban populations everywhere will need to expand essential services such as clean water, electricity, fiberoptic lines and transportation.
2
We expect to see investments in digital infrastructure grow steadily, creating strong demand for networks and data centers.
The opportunity is not just in emerging markets: In the United States, for example, 27% of households do not have adequate, or any, internet access—either because it is unaffordable or unavailable.
3
In many places, the shift from copper to fiber optic cable still needs to extend to the “last mile”—homes, offices and stores.
In the United States, 70% of electrical systems are well into the second half of their lifespans.
4
As for water: A U.S. water main breaks every two minutes, causing the loss of about six billion gallons of treated water every day.
5
The public sector alone can’t afford to fix it.2. Infrastructure is historically resilient when growth slows and less volatile than stocks and bonds
It’s a compelling case, we think: Infrastructure has offered relative stability, especially in 2022, when global stocks lost 17.7% and bonds fell 11.2%.
6
It also traditionally offers consistent income and, at times, a substantial return uplift for those able to forego liquidity.
7
Those highly attractive qualities are drawing in private capital, and we expect valuations for infrastructure assets to find support from continued fundraising inflows.
Whether this year brings a recession, slower economic growth, or if central banks continue rate hikes to tame inflation, we expect widespread dislocations to continue.
Under inflationary conditions, utilities can pass through cost increases to customers in various ways. As a result, you may want to look for this type of infrastructure income: contracted, regulated and inflation-indexed.
And because core infrastructure historically performs well throughout the economic cycle’s ups and downs, its resilience can mute economic and market shocks to portfolios, preserving the consistency of the cash-flow yield that is being generated by those “essential” assets.3. The urgent, costly energy transition to decarbonization drives many investment opportunities
Replacing fossil fuels with renewables is a priority for many governments, asset owners and global organizations. While many industries (transit, automotive, manufacturing) must decarbonize, power generation is key and may cost more than headlines suggest.
8
For economies to achieve their net-zero commitments by 2030,
9
wind power capacity, solar generation and especially battery storage capacity will have to rise exponentially. Forecasts indicate that $750 billion per year is needed, creating a deep and broad private market opportunity set: from venture capital investing in new, breakthrough technologies to later-stage buyouts focused on more established and profitable businesses across all aspects of infrastructure.
Infrastructure has important backing: The
U.S.
Inflation Reduction Act
passed in August 2022 was one such signal. The law includes incentives for consumers and companies to shift to green energy. Although, as a 10-year plan, it will take years to unfold and should support more attractive opportunities on the horizon.
4. Countries want domestic energy security
The war in Ukraine revealed Europe’s dependence on Russian gas, reminding the world that diversifying where you get your power can be a matter of geopolitical security. European economies will need significant investment to that end.
In our view, the risk/return outlook is positive, since many government policies today encourage domestic energy development, both new and built on existing (“brownfield”) sites. Moreover, for energy security and affordability, fossil-fuel-based infrastructure will also likely be part of the global energy mix for decades. That, too, opens investment opportunities—to increase efficiency and lighten old assets’ carbon footprints.

Our Top Market Takeaways for April 21, 2023
Market update
So far, so good
Investor focus has shifted from banks to corporate earnings and economic data. And so far, companies are proving more resilient than expected, despite signs pointing to a slowing U.S. economy.
Most notably, the too-hot labor market is showing early signs of easing up. The number of continuing unemployment claims reached the highest level in nearly two years. The housing market is also working hard to find its footing. The NAHB Housing Market Index, a survey of homebuilders for new homes, hit its highest level since September and is in its fourth straight month of increases. But extremely low inventories are keeping existing home sales at a trough-like level.
Global growth is also still solid. The Global Purchasing Managers’ Index has bounced from last fall. China is in the early stages of its reopening, with economic growth now running at its fastest pace in four quarters. Europe is benefiting from the pent-up demand, and even EM export data is exceeding expectations by the most in two years.
Markets had a hard time finding direction along the way. Heading into Friday, the S&P 500 looks to finish the week just slightly off of where it started (~4,130), and bond yields took a round trip on both hot and cold data. But despite a mixed week, stocks have now gone 20 straight trading days without falling at least 1%, the longest streak in nearly two years. Implied equity volatility has collapsed to its lowest levels since the Federal Reserve started hiking.
The path from here will likely hinge on the rest of earnings season (a busier next week) and word from the Fed at its meeting in the first days of May.
In the meantime, it’s been close to four months since the U.S. government hit its debt limit, and the saga has floated back to the surface. In the rest of today’s note, we revisit what we know and what we’ve learned out of Washington over the past week.Spotlight
Guess who’s back, back again: Debt ceiling drama
At the start of the year, the U.S. government hit its legal $31.4 trillion debt limit.
We published a note
at the time that walked through the fundamentals of the debt ceiling, what happens when the government approaches these levels, and what investors have experienced in past Washington showdowns. Over the last few months, the Treasury (which is responsible for the government’s pocketbook) has been hard at work using “extraordinary measures” to help the government continue paying its obligations and avoid default. But those measures can only last so long.
The background:
Some form of a cap on government debt has been in place since 1917, and an event such as this is far from uncommon. If Congress fails to suspend or raise the limit by the potential default date, also known as the “X-date,” we would expect the Treasury to prioritize paying its debt obligations, while curbing other expenditures such as education and transportation, or more even drastically, Social Security. If the Treasury then fails to make payments on its obligations (worst case), the impact could be calamitous—a reason to expect that a compromise among policymakers would eventually be found.In the long history of the debt limit, the impasse in 2011 carries the most notoriety. Congress increased the ceiling just before the X-date, the closest call on record. Days later, the S&P downgraded the government’s credit rating to AA+ from AAA. Risk assets reacted negatively: The dollar sold off, stocks sank and credit spreads widened, but a strong rally in Treasuries led bonds higher overall. Outside of this instance, markets have been more driven by the prevailing economic and market dynamics of the time, and volatility has been ultimately short-lived.
The takeaway:
The U.S. government has approached and exceeded the debt limit dozens of times throughout history, and in each instance, policymakers have eventually come to a compromise to raise the ceiling and avoid the worst-case scenarios. The best way for investors to prepare for potential disorder is by simply sticking with their long-term portfolio plans that are built to weather events such as these.
What’s ahead:
Negotiations in Congress are starting.
Republicans detailed their stance this week. The bill has not yet been finalized, though House Speaker McCarthy came out with a proposal for a $4.5 trillion reduction in budget deficits over the next decade in exchange for a temporary suspension of the limit through March 2024, or a $1.5 trillion increase. The details include a significant reduction to non-defense discretionary spending, a reversal of student debt cancellation, a return of unused pandemic funds and more.
Even if the bill is passed in the House after it’s ironed out (an uncertain outcome, given a slim majority and fractured caucus), the proposal will likely be a non-starter for Democrats. Negotiations look set to go down to the wire.
Tax revenues will soon provide clarity on the potential default date.
The second catalyst of this week was Tax Day on April 18. Tax revenue data will soon allow investors to better pinpoint the runway to the X-date. For now, this timing is widely estimated to fall between June and August (with bias on the earlier side due to weak receipts so far), but we expect estimates to shift in the coming days.
We see three scenarios on how this could play out.
We think the first is the most likely:
(1)  The debt ceiling is increased ahead of the potential default date.
In every instance in history, this has been the eventual outcome, and we expect this year to be no different. As Congress works out a compromise, we’re likely to see investors avoid Treasury bills that mature in the wake of the X-date. This has already started to play out as 3-month Treasury bill yields have spiked and 1-month Treasury bill yields have plummeted to their lowest level since last October. In fact, the dispersion between the two is the widest in over 20 years. We expect these oddities to continue as policymakers work out the kinks to reassure investors of the soundness of short-term government debt.(2)  We go through the X-date without a ceiling increase, but the Treasury still makes interest payments to avoid a technical default.
In our view, to avoid default, the government would prioritize security payments at the expense of cuts to discretionary, or even mandatory, spending. The consequence of this is a direct hit to economic activity and financial market sentiment. Other ways to avoid default would be to simply ignore the debt limit on grounds that it violates the 14th Amendment (which would cause serious legal trouble), or the Treasury could mint a coin and deposit it to the Fed—the latter being, to us, highly farfetched.
(3)  We go through the X-date and delay payments (i.e., default).
This would be the worst-case and least likely scenario. It’s hard to say what the full consequences would be, but it’s likely the harsh reaction across financial assets would warrant movement from Congress. But even if the debt limit is subsequently raised, the question remains on whether Treasuries would need to trade with a permanently increased risk premium (i.e., investors would demand to be compensated more for taking on greater risk). The “risk-free” rate would be a term of the past.
Investment implications
Diversification is still the best defense
The potential for a disorderly debt ceiling episode provides another opportunity for global investors to reconsider their portfolio allocations across asset classes and regions.
Further, yields globally are still near recent highs, with bonds outside of the United States also providing compelling income and protection in the event of a broad economic downturn. Finally, while stocks could take a hit in an adverse scenario, high-quality international equities are being supported by a resilient global growth story and could provide relative insulation. For the more tactical investor, safe-haven currencies like the Japanese yen and Swiss franc, as well as precious metals such as gold, could provide some protection.
And for those sitting on excess cash, debt ceiling turbulence could be a good thing to watch for a potential entry point.
All told, debt ceiling episodes have come and subsequently gone in the past. While the last couple of years in markets have taught us to “never say never,” our base case is for an agreement before the default date is breached.
The most powerful tool in investors’ toolkits is simply sticking with the long-term investment plan that was set up to weather events such as these.

Bruno de la Sota, US Equity Strategist
This year’s
JPMorgan Chase&Co. Shareholder Letter from Chairman & CEO Jamie Dimon
highlights the importance of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and the Journey to The Cloud. AI is an extraordinary groundbreaking technology which may not only reshape the finance industry, but accelerate the next era of innovation and efficiency. In our view ChatGPT is just the beginning of what is possible.
Since its launch in November 2022, ChatGPT has taken the world and media by storm. Reaching 1 million users quicker than any other application, its rapid ascent has raised some fundamental questions about the nature of AI, and what it means for the broader economy.
In this piece, we analyze the various factors driving this phenomenon
What is ChatGPT?
We asked ChatGPT who – and exactly what – it is. This is what we got.
“ChatGPT is a large language model trained by OpenAI that is capable of generating human-like responses to natural language queries. It works by utilizing a deep neural network architecture called a transformer, which has been trained on a massive amount of textual data to learn patterns and relationships between words, phrases, and sentences.
[…]
In essence, ChatGPT works by processing a large amount of textual data to learn patterns and relationships between words and phrases, which it then uses to generate contextually relevant and linguistically coherent responses to queries. The result is a system that can understand and respond to natural language queries in a way that mimics human conversation.”
Not perfect, but quite impressive.
Why all that buzz?
OpenAI launched GPT-3.5 in November of 2022. The public prototype quickly gained traction, reaching 1M users in only 5 days. By January 2023, it surpassed the 100 million user mark, making it the fastest growing platform ever.
The large language model (LLM) successfully distinguishes itself from the traditional chatbot by making itself look and feel like a genuine human interaction with a great level of
expertise across a wide range of topics. LLMs have the potential to redefine how we approach daily tasks increasing efficiency and improve utility and engagement. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Big Tech quickly announced multi-year commitments to Generative AI:
Some of the headlines:
“Microsoft Invests $10 Billion in ChatGPT Maker OpenAI”
(Bloomberg, 01.23.2023)
“Google Releases ChatGPT Rival AI ‘Bard’ to Early Testers”
(Bloomberg, 02.06.2023)
“Baidu Surges as Hope Mounts over Chinese Answer to ChatGPT
” (Bloomberg 02.06.2023)
“Salesforce follows Microsoft in launching A.I. tools for salespeople with help from OpenAI”
(CNBC 03.07.2023)
“Salesforce Launches $250 Million Fund for Generative AI Startups”
(Bloomberg 03.07.2023)
“Citadel Negotiating Enterprise-Wide ChatGPT License”
(Bloomberg 03.07.2023)Generative AI investments will likely focus on 3 layers: 1) Applications that integrate AI models into user-facing products, 2) Models that power AI products running on proprietary models (or on open source) and 3) Infrastructure vendors that run the computing power required to service the models.
Use cases for ChatGPT and LLMs
Owing to their adaptability, LLMs have become very powerful. Only recently, ChatGPT passed: 1) a Wharton MBA exam, 2) a U.S. medical licensing exam, 3) several law school exams and 4) a Google coding interview for a Level 3 engineer with a $183,000 salary. Evidently, the prospects are wide-ranging.
Some other use cases could include:
Conversational Agents:
Think of an e-commerce chatbot acknowledging the availability of inventory, then recommending a product that could be delivered the following day. Customers receive an expedited service, and operations are improved by accounting for stock levels, planning, supply chain disruptions and lead times. Put simply, the AI can undertake such tasks quicker and more efficient.
Virtual Assistants:
Recently, Salesforce confirmed that they would integrate ChatGPT into EinsteinGPT, their CRM service. The virtual assistant will automate more time-intensive sales tasks like composing emails, scheduling meetings and preparing notes for future interactions. By using generative AI to summarize past customer exchanges, sales teams will be able improve their chances of closing. It could even automate the process of prospecting altogether.
Language processing:
Industries relying on extensive contract edits could also benefit. LLMs have the capacity to draft a contract suggesting suitable language and even review existing agreements. The technology could also be leveraged during legal research to provide summaries of cases, laws and even translations.
Medicine and Diagnosis:
Virtual assistants for telemedicine, clinical decision support, evidence-based recommendations that improve patient outcomes. These are just some of the ways AI could facilitate medical processes.
Should I be using ChatGPT instead of Google?
In short, not really. Broadly speaking, ChatGPT and LLMs are not designed to become better versions of existing search engines. Alphabet could certainly embed functionalities within the classic search engine tool to offer conversational response similar to ChatGPT. However, improvements in efficiency and productivity by integrating LLM into existing services & products is where we think the real growth opportunity is. As key players start to position, we would expect investments in the following segments for commercial AI applications:
1.
Productivity and Efficiency Applications
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has been very vocal about the integration of ChatGPT into Bing’s search business, following Microsoft’s investment into OpenAI. The upside potential comes from growth in productivity and an Office365 offering. GitHub Copilot (powered by OpenAI Codex and acquired by Microsoft in October 2018) already shares autocomplete-style suggestions from an AI pair programmer as you code.
On March 16
th
2023, Microsoft introduced Copilot to a small number of enterprises and individuals, testing the integration of ChatGPT GPT4 into Office365. Copilot in Word gives users a first draft to edit and iterate, eliminating the worry of writer’s block. Copilot in PowerPoint helps create presentations with a simple prompt. The Excel iteration analyzes trends, creating professional-looking data visualizations in seconds. With Teams, those late to meetings will be able to get a summary transcript of what they missed. Copilot will even be able to assist the organization of Outlook inboxes.
It’s only a matter of time until companies decide to monetize improvements in utility. However, the real advancement will only be as good as the underlying data in which the algorithm is trained on.
2. Cloud Infrastructure
Running queries on large datasets can increase workloads on the public cloud infrastructure. The scaling needed to satisfy the demand for computing power will only put upward pressure on infrastructure investment. It is here that having a cloud partner, like Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud Platform, is key to develop a solid LLM.
3. Computing power and Chips
Estimating the capacity required to absorb increasing workloads ranges widely. Latest forecasts (source: Dell’Oro) expect unit shipments for AI datacenters to double from ~7% today to ~15% by 2027, and revenue to grow from ~20% today to ~45% by 2027. That expansion appears to be driven by a 3x-10x increase in AI server costs.
What are the costs and challenges for AI?
Running & training LLMs isn’t cheap. Ultimately, cost per search will come down as algorithms get more efficient. LLMs perform poorly when models can’t access enough data for training, resulting in “underfitting.” The flipside is also true: overtraining may lead to tunnel vision, leading to a lack of knowledge in other fields. Regulation is also likely to pick up. With each product cycle, regulators have been quicker to respond to potentially contentious issues, especially in relation to content moderation proliferation of disinformation and biases.
What does AI mean for the economy and labor market?
We figured we’d put ChatGPT to work. We asked it key questions about the impact of AI, then analyzed its answers.
Is AI good for the economy?
ChatGPT
:
“Artificial intelligence (AI) can have a positive impact on economic growth in a number of ways: 1) Increased productivity: AI can automate routine tasks and perform them faster and more accurately than humans, which can increase productivity and output; 2) Cost savings: By automating tasks and processes, AI can reduce labor costs; 3) New business opportunities: AI can help businesses identify new opportunities for growth and innovation; 4) Improved decision-making: AI can help businesses make more informed and data-driven decisions.
However, it is important to note that some industries may see greater benefits than others, and the impact of AI on employment and income inequality also needs to be considered.”
Our take:
Just like disruptive innovations of the past, AI is likely to boost the productivity of the US economy. Jobs may be displaced during the rebalancing process, but growing pains should give way to new jobs and greater worker output.Estimates are wide-ranging, but many suggest company productivity improves by 2-4%
1
when AI is adopted. Around 25% of companies are expected to embrace AI in a meaningful way (based on estimates from Goldman, more on this later) and that could amount to an annual productivity boost to GDP of 0.5%.
How will AI impact the labor market?
ChatGPT
:
“Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to automate many jobs that are currently performed by humans, which can lead to job displacement in certain industries. However, it's important to note that AI can also create new job opportunities and change the nature of work.
Some jobs may see more automation than others, and some industries may see a greater demand for workers with AI-related skills. Jobs that require creativity, social intelligence, or physical dexterity, are less likely to be automated by AI.”
Our take:
AI will impact the labor market, much like the advent of prior technological innovations. To maximize profits, US corporations have often found cheaper labor abroad and/or automated processes.
As we look forward, “the race between automation and augmentation” is on
2
. Goldman Sachs estimates that 25% of current work tasks could be automated by AI in the U.S. and Europe
3
. They find that traditionally high skill, nonroutine jobs are highly susceptible to automation from AI (legal & financial operations). Meanwhile, manually intensive jobs or roles that require interpersonal skills are less susceptible (construction, personal care).What comes next?
“AI will be critical to our company’s future success [..] The importance of implementing new technologies cannot be overstated.”
Chiarman & CEO Jamie Dimon Annual Shareholder Letter
Expect more companies to announce multi-year commitments with OpenAI, or share developments on their own language processing models. The opportunities are immense, and it remains unclear who will lead the race of innovation. What is clear is that the battle is not only between the Technology companies, nor is it about the winner taking it all. In an era of efficiency and productivity, those that respond the quickest will lead. The incumbents have a head start, but new players will undoubtedly emerge.1

Based on the review of existing literature on the probable use cases of generative AI, GS classified 13 work activities (out of 39 in the O*NET database) as exposed to AI automation, and in the base case assumes that AI is capable of completing tasks up to a difficulty of 4 on the 7-point O*NET “level” scale. GS then takes an importance and complexity-weighted average of essential work tasks for each occupation and estimates the share of each occupation’s total workload that AI has the potential to replace. GS further assumes that occupations for which a significant share of workers’ time is spent outdoors or performing physical labor cannot be automated by AI.The visual shows the speed of adoption of the fastest growing applications. The average time to reach 1million users for the fastest growing applications was 570 days. ChatGPT reached 1million users in only 5 days.The visual shows the number of deals and funding in Generative AI since 2017. Deal numbers have moved from only 23 in 17’ to over 110 in 22’. Funding has moved from just $71m in 17’ to over $2.6bn. 2023 will comfortably beat that.The visual shows a close correlation between economic long run potential growth (function of labor force growth and labor productivity) and GDP. The improvement in productivity from Generative AI could boost economic growth going forward.The visual shows the jobs at risk of automation, on the graph plotted are different jobs ranging from manufacturing to services jobs. Y-axis shows $ per hour, X-axis shows % share of employment exposed to automation. Manually intensive jobs or roles that require interpersonal skills are less susceptible to automation, whilst traditionally high skill jobs are highly susceptible to automation from AI.Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.

As we go through another happening week in current events, we got a “softer” inflation print at last. In October, headline price increases held at 0.4% month-over-month (below 0.6% expected) and core prices increased 0.3% month-over-month (vs. 0.5% expected). Shelter costs accounted for the bulk of the month’s increase, while goods inflation decelerated. Equity markets rallied hard (S&P 500 +5.5%, Nasdaq +7.4%). Yields plummeted, with the 10Y Treasury down around 30bps to 3.8%.
October’s print comes as welcome news, but the Fed will likely to continue its hiking campaign to tame inflation - price increases are just too high and broad. But as inflation starts to decelerate - especially around ongoing pressure points like wages and services - it could indicate we are nearer to the end of this era of policy tightening. We think it’s likely the Fed starts to slow down the magnitude of hikes from here - from 75bps last month to 50bps in December, and 25bps towards the start of next year.
Of course, inflation is also one of the key issues for U.S. voters as they head to the polls. Based on current tracking, the anticipated Republican “red wave” appears to be more of a “red ripple”. So far, Republicans seem likely to gain control of the House of Representatives, but by slimmer margins than expected. Some critical Senate races, such as Arizona, Nevada, and Georgia (which is headed for a runoff in December) are still too close to call. As of writing, election models and prediction markets show that Democrats are favored to retain control of the Senate. For more on the implications of these elections, we encourage you to review this
note
produced by our U.S. colleagues.
In markets, a storm has hit the crypto world. FTX, one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, came under heavy pressure amidst concerns of insolvency. Rival exchange Binance announced last weekend that it would liquidate holdings of the FTX token due to unspecified “recent revelations”. It later said it would walk away from an offer to bail out FTX after reviewing the company’s structure and books and added that issues with FTX are beyond Binance's control or ability to help. The SEC and CFTC are also investigating whether FTX mishandled customer funds. Bitcoin fell to the lowest level since late-2020, along with a selloff in the broader crypto complex.
Amidst a string of key current events and market moves, Asian assets also continue to experience significant volatility. Asian credits are under pressure in the wake of a non-call on a perpetual bond by a Korean issuer, heightening investor worries about refinancing risks as global yields continue to grind up and financial conditions tighten. On this thread, higher U.S. interest rates have pulled up rates in Hong Kong, adding further pressure on the SAR’s economy, which is still on the path of recovery following COVID control measures. Volatility in the Hong Kong dollar has also spiked amidst renewed concerns over the strength and viability of the currency peg. In today’s note, we address some of the top questions and concerns on the Hong Kong economy and markets and consider some investment implications.
Strategy Question: Hong Kong: Will sharply higher rates challenge the peg?
Once gain questions are being raised about the Hong Kong dollar peg. Questions generally focus around whether or not the peg will break, whether maintaining the peg will be too onerous for Hong Kong’s economy, and why Hong Kong is still pegged to the US Dollar when its economic cycle is most closely tied to China. We will address those in today’s note.
How Hong Kong’s peg works: As a reminder, the exchange rate mechanism that pegs the Hong Kong Dollar to the U.S. Dollar is operated through a “currency board.” What does this mean? A currency board links a currency (here the HKD) to an anchor currency (USD in Hong Kong’s case) by law, and requires the monetary base to be fully backed by foreign reserves, in that theoretically every banknote could be exchanged for a U.S. Dollar. Additionally, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) cannot set discretionary monetary policy. The stability of the exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment, where interest rates rather than the exchange rate adjust to the inflow or outflow of capital. In a global tightening process, outflows from Hong Kong create downward pressures on the HKD. At the weak side of the band, the HKMA sells USD reserves and buys HKD. This tightens HKD liquidity, and pushes up local interest rates. Higher interest rates attract inflows back into HKD. The stability of the exchange rate is maintained through this automatic interest rate adjustment, where interest rates rather than the exchange rate adjust to the inflow or outflow of capital. As part of the Linked Exchange Rate Mechanism, higher interest rates are inevitable during periods of U.S. tightening. The drawbacks of this system are that the HKMA cannot implement independent monetary policies, nor can they set interest rates or expand or contract their balance sheet to reflect local conditions. Nonetheless, this automatic process does make the currency board system very stable and resilient.Lately, outflows from the local markets have reduced the aggregate balance – which represents excess liquidity in the banking system – to HKD100bn. Below this level, the interest rate adjustment will likely be faster. This has pushed up HIBOR to meaningfully converge with, and even outpace LIBOR. Due to excess liquidity from multiple rounds of quantitative easing over the last decade, interest rates in Hong Kong have rarely exceeded rates in the US. But it can happen in the more advanced stage of a tightening cycle (such as in 2019), or in a more rapid tightening cycle (such as the one we are in right now). In 2019, the aggregate balance fell to around HKD55bn when HIBOR overshot LIBOR more meaningfully.Recent worries about the stability of the currency peg are in our view over-blown. Currently, foreign reserves designated to defend the peg, namely the backing assets, still stand at over 100% of the monetary base and have remained steady in recent years. No Hong Kong dollars have been created without the equivalent amount of U.S dollars set aside in reserves. The broader pool of reserve assets at USD430bn is even bigger, and represents over five times the currency in circulation. It is worth remembering that properly managed currency boards do not simply break from market forces. Meanwhile, the policy commitment towards the HKD peg is unwavering, and rightly so given that this is still the most viable monetary arrangement for a financial center like Hong Kong.Higher interest rates are a risk to Hong Kong’ economic outlook, but not enough to make the peg too painful to maintain
Indeed, sectors that are sensitive to higher interest rates, for example the housing market, will likely be under pressure. House prices are down around 10.6% YTD and about 11.4% from the peak, and there is room for further declines as interest rates continue to rise. Yet, compared with 1997, the market’s overall sensitivity to higher rates is significantly reduced. Less than 20% of residential properties have an outstanding mortgage (by value), and the average down-payment is 50% in the secondary market (which accounts for the vast majority of transactions).Higher rates are not what Hong Kong needs as it continues its fragile economic recovery. Nonetheless, Hong Kong has been through this before and it’s a necessary cost to be an international financial center. For Hong Kong, free capital flows are essential to being an international financial center. And a fixed exchange rate is important to support global business and investor confidence underpinning those flows. Thus the peg is a crucial aspect underpinning Hong Kong’s role as a global financial center. There are times, like now, when Hong Kong’s cycle will get out of sync with the US, and when the city’s peg to the US dollar will act as a pro-cyclical amplifier, compounding the local boom-and-bust cycle. This is painful, but it is accepted as the price for the peg’s benefits. Furthermore it’s not an unprecedented phenomenon, for example Hong Kong accepted six years of deflation between 1998 and 2003 partly as a consequence of the peg; it can accept high interest rates now.
Ending an peg is usually a political decision not a market decision
This is especially the case with Hong Kong given that a currency board peg mechanism has never been
broken
by the market. The question is often raised whether it makes more sense to end the USD peg and re-peg to the RMB or a basket of currencies. This could be true over the very long term; however, for the foreseeable future, the peg is in every party’s best interest. Stability makes sense for Hong Kong, China benefits from a pool of offshore USD liquidity, and there simply isn’t another near-term option.
China’s closed capital account gives Hong Kong a crucial role in intermediating capital flows into and out of China, and servicing China’s foreign trade with the rest of the world. In essense in serves as China’s ‘free trade zone’ and provides access to hard currency through the HKD. Many of China’s capital and trade flows are still denominated in US dollars, and the earnings of companies in these business areas are in US dollars, therefore there is a clear advantage to Hong Kong in pegging its currency to the US dollar rather than the renminbi in order to minimize exchange rate risk.
A shift away from the USD may be possible many years down the road when the Chinese capital account is fully open and the Renminbi is fully convertible. But the reality is that the offshore renminbi market has shrunk over the last five years as China further tightened its capital account to stem outflows. Thus the role of HKD remains critical and fundamental for the foreseeable future.
Investment implications
In FX, the recent rise in HKD volatility can also present investment opportunities. Investors may consider taking advantage of this volatility to monetize both upsides and downsides in the HKD outside of the band.
In equities, while the composition of the local stock market is not particularly reflective of the domestic economy, there are some segments that could see a more direct impact from higher interest rates. For example, Hong Kong banks could be a net beneficiary amid interest rate hikes, as net interest margins (NIM) have proven to be highly correlated with HIBOR and LIBOR over the past ten years. The additional net interest income could offset some of the potential impact from rising loan impairments as tighter monetary conditions further slow down the Hong Kong economy. On the other hand, Hong Kong developers, particularly those that are more highly leveraged, could face greater headwinds amid rising interest rates as property sales slow and re-financing costs rise.
In fixed income, we remain positive on some Hong Kong names in the Asia investment grade credit space, such as banks, financials and select developers. We prefer relatively higher-rated issuers with strong balance sheets and cashflows, and note that these credits constitute a sizable part of the overall Hong Kong credit universe.All market and economic data as of November 10, 2022 and sourced from Bloomberg Finance L.P. and FactSet unless otherwise stated.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Today, choosing where and how to hold your cash reserves is as important as any investment decision.Recent shocks to the global banking system have made it clear that great care is needed when it comes to selecting a primary banking institution.
Today, it is important to be well informed on wide-ranging topics, such as the strength of a financial institution’s balance sheet, the effectiveness of the cybersecurity protections it provides, and the quality of the advice and services it offers. The rate of interest you earn on your money is only part of the equation.
Here is where we recommend focusing your attention as you evaluate the long-term security of your assets and where you entrust your wealth.
What are the limits of government protection?
Following recent market volatility and uncertainties around the banking industry, questions have arisen regarding the extent of federal government protections for deposit accounts.
U.S. deposit accounts are protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) for up to $250,000 per each depositor account if it is held at an insured bank. Keep in mind:
If you maintain multiple accounts of the same type (two or more deposit accounts, for example) at a single bank, the combined deposits are insured up to the standard $250,000 amount
The interests of each individual in all joint accounts at the same FDIC-insured depository institution are added together and insured up to $250,000 per individual
For trusts, the amount of the insurance coverage is based on the number of beneficiaries, and in some cases, the interests allocated to them, up to $250,000 per beneficiary, per insured bank
You do not have to apply for FDIC protection. Coverage is automatically provided for each type of deposit account ownership category
1If your accounts hold more than the standard insured amount, it is the stability/capitalization of the institution where you bank that protects your deposits beyond the FDIC-insured amount.

Can your bank weather adverse market conditions?
Basel III, an international regulatory accord, introduced a set of reforms to mitigate risk within the global banking sector in the wake of the Great Recession (2008). These tighter regulatory controls and capital requirements require banks to maintain certain leverage ratio. For example, one key ratio sets limits on how much money an institution can lend relative to how much capital it devotes to its own assets. Another requires banks to keep certain levels of reserve capital on hand. While not fully implemented by all countries signing the pact, these and other new regulations have helped strengthen the global banking system.
While there is enormous complexity to these efforts, three closely watched indicators can help you monitor the fiscal health of your financial institution:
Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital—
This is the core capital that a bank holds in its capital structure. Regulators require banks to hold certain levels of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital as reserves so that they are able to absorb losses without any repercussions. The minimum Tier 1 capital ratio is 6% of the bank’s risk-weighted assets
CET1 Ratio—
This figure compares a bank’s capital against its risk-weighted assets to determine its ability to withstand financial distress. A low CET1 ratio shows that a bank may not be able to absorb a financial shock.
CET1 information can be found in a bank’s public filings; specifically, in its 10-K or 10-Q reports
Credit rating—
Credit rating
assesses the ability of countries and businesses, including financial institutions, around the world to meet their financial commitments. The most common rating agencies are
Standard & Poor’s
(S&P),
Moody’s
and
Fitch
, which evaluate credit ratings based on a letter scale. Each agency’s highest credit rating is either “AAA” or “Aaa,” demonstrating strong reliability and low risk. Ratings are updated on a quarterly basis and posted on each agency’s respective website
How strong are your bank’s investments in cybersecurity protections?
Today, as online banking, investing and payment systems become ever more embedded in the financial lives of people around the world, cyber criminals are finding equally sophisticated ways to insert themselves into the global banking system.
To protect client assets and information as well as their own operations, financial institutions invest heavily in computer systems that not only monitor money movement transactions for fraud, but software, networks, storage devices and other technology assets. Among the notable—and often visible—results of these efforts are multi-factor authentication; rigorous privacy controls; real-time notifications when problems occur; training and educating staff and clients to improve their security postures as new threats emerge.
How much cash do you need to have on hand?
Once you are satisfied with the safety and security of your assets at your core banking institution(s), consider how much liquidity or cash on hand you require day-to-day and longer-term to support your investment strategy.
In uncertain times, it is natural to want to hold on to more cash than you may need so that you have a psychological safety net, perhaps leading you to go beyond having enough liquidity to:
Cover operating expenses for yourself and your family
Fund large purchases
Optimize your portfolio by taking advantage of unexpected opportunities
However, when inflation hits and interest rates rise, holding too much cash can be counterproductive to your goals. As with managing risk in the longer-term investments on your balance sheet, you might diversify and put excess cash to work via:
A day-to-day cash management strategy—Checking, savings or money market fund account that gives you ready access to cash
Short-term liquidity—Three, six and nine-month certificates of deposit (CDs) or other short-term investments
Long-term liquidity—12- or 24-month CDs, short-term investments, or short-duration fixed income

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.It’s been a strong start to the year, but challenges remain—from inflation to bank stress aftershocks, to the debt ceiling. Are markets oblivious to the risks, or keenly aware of them?Our Top Market Takeaways for April 28, 2023
Market update
What’s priced in?
Take the bad with the good.
On one hand, this week showed growth is slowing, aftershocks from the banking crisis are continuing to reverberate, and the U.S. debt ceiling is lurking. Yet, Q1 earnings season is sending a strong signal that Corporate America is hanging on tight.
It’s the latter that’s sent markets grinding higher this week. A global portfolio of stocks and bonds is now up to the tune of ~6% so far this year.
*
Markets are anticipation machines—virtually all price action can be explained by what investors expect to happen in the future. So does that mean markets are oblivious to the risks, or keenly aware of them?
For today’s note, we offer our take on what’s priced in:
1. A slowdown…without a recession
The U.S. economy grew 1.1% in the first quarter this year, slowing from Q4’s 2.6% pace and missing expectations. Consumption was still strong, but companies cut back on investment and drew down on their inventories. While that’s not good news, investors have had a long time to prepare. Much portfolio purging happened last year—remember 2022 marked the S&P 500’s worst year since the Global Financial Crisis and U.S. core bonds’ worst on record.
Markets also seem to be doing a pretty good job at sniffing out the problem areas. Heading into Friday, First Republic lost a staggering -57% this week as questions around its future percolated, while broader regional banks are down just -1.2%. The same can be said for ongoing worries around
commercial real estate
. REITs in the troubled office sector have sunk -18% this year, while the broader universe is +0.7% higher.
But while investors seem to have prepared for a slowdown ahead, the strong gains we’ve seen so far this year suggest that the potential for our base case of a recession isn’t fully appreciated either. As just a rough barometer, Google searches for “recession” have dramatically faded.2. The Federal Reserve getting its job done…not sticky prices
Inflation has slowed, but is still hot and well above the Fed’s 2% target—in large part due to a still resilient labor market. Yesterday brought word that 16,000 less people filed for unemployment insurance over the last week than the one before, even as companies have announced more job cuts (the likes of McDonald’s, Lyft, Walmart, Whole Foods and Deloitte all joined in this month).
Yet, markets are still betting on the Fed getting things back in balance, with expectations for future inflation (for instance, five-year breakeven rates) well anchored around the Fed’s mandate. Consumers also tend to agree. The latest survey from the University of Michigan showed that while consumers think prices will climb by 4.6% over the next year (up from 3.6% in March), they expect costs to rise at a lesser 2.9% pace over the next five years (holding steady from the prior month).We tend to agree that the Fed will get its job done (with one more hike at next week’s meeting and cuts in the final months of the year), but getting inflation in check will likely come at a greater economic cost than the market expects. The average economist on the Street expects the unemployment rate to rise to 4.7% from today’s 3.5%. But as the impact of the rate hikes already seen continues to build, and the flow of credit is stymied as banks cut back on lending, we think more pronounced layoffs may be in the cards.
3. A short-lived downturn in corporate profits…but not meaningful pain
While it’s still early days, earnings for Q1 are so far, so good. Banks have been much better than expected, mega-cap tech has been blowing it out of the water, and consumer-linked names are showing they still have pricing power.
To be fair, things are definitely slowing down—right now, consensus expects S&P 500 earnings per share to fall -4% in Q1 over the prior year. But that’s already improved from expectations for more than -7% at the start of the quarter. And as just over half of the index has reported, some 80% of companies have bested expectations, above the five-year average of 77%.
What’s more, markets are expecting this to pretty much be the worst of it, with this or next quarter marking the trough in profits and a quick bounceback thereafter.We think that’s probably just a bit too optimistic. Tailwinds such as growing efforts to cut costs, stronger supply chains and a weaker U.S. dollar still need to be weighed against slower growth, higher prices and general business uncertainty. To us, that means earnings will still probably decline around -4% for the balance of 2023 versus the market’s bet to eke out +1% growth.
4. Growth over value, and international over United States…but there’s probably still some room to go
Much of the S&P 500’s rally this year is thanks to mega-cap tech. For instance, the largest 10 stocks in the S&P 500 (seven of which are tech or tech-enabled firms) make up just over 25% of the index, but account for 6.0% out of the index’s 8.3% year-to-date total return. The remaining 490 stocks have contributed a mere ~2.3%. Tech could continue its reign as growth becomes scarcer and investors see the highest-quality names as a safe havens—but over the medium term, we still see more value in
small- and mid-cap stocks
.International stocks have been the other bright spot this year. Europe is outperforming the United States by 5.5% in dollar terms. Is it all priced in? We don’t think so. For one, Europe is still trading at a ~28% discount to the United States—wider than its longer-term 20% average.
5. Debt ceiling drama…but not default
Angst over the
looming debt ceiling
has revved back up. Even as House Speaker McCarthy passed a bill this week that would suspend the limit for a year in exchange for spending cuts, it’s unlikely to gain much traction in the Senate. Negotiations are just getting going, and lower tax revenues this year also suggest the X-date (the potential default date) could come on the earlier side.
Markets are reflecting some of the risk, with record-wide dispersion in T-bill yields (as investors avoid ones maturing near the potential default date) and a historic pop higher in U.S. government credit default swaps (i.e., the cost to insure against a default in government debt). These oddities will probably continue as policymakers work out the kinks, but we and investors believe a compromise will eventually be found to avoid a worst-case scenario.All in all, the market seems
priced for what we know now.
It doesn’t fully reflect recession risks, but it doesn’t entirely account for a bull case of smooth sailing ahead, either.
As investors seek answers, it’s likely more volatility is ahead. Bonds can help smooth the ride and offer protection, especially as growth slows. This also means that U.S. stocks are probably in for a choppy ride, leading us to see more opportunities in select sectors (reasonably priced technology, industrials, healthcare), as well as in Europe and China. Taking a longer-term view with megatrends, such as the energy transition, supply chain reorientation and digital transformation, may also offer stability and growth in the face of the evolving cycle.
It’s natural to be skeptical, especially given the existing slate of unknowns. Your J.P. Morgan team is here to help.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.As interest rates increase, so does the allure of optimizing your U.S. income tax deductions. But be careful, the devil is in the details.Are you a U.S. taxpayer looking to buy a new home? Expand your portfolio? Grow your business?
If you’re interested in financing for these purposes, you’d be well advised to look into the tax strategies that could reduce the real cost of borrowing—especially as interest rates in general and mortgage rates in particular keep rising.
Interesting opportunities are available because U.S. tax laws do not treat all forms of interest equally.  Individuals are allowed to deduct the interest on their:
Qualified residential home mortgages (to a certain amount)
Loans used to make taxable investments
Loans taken for capital commitments to an operating trade or business
1
But, as with most matters concerning U.S. taxes, the devil is in the details. So here, we offer a quick guide to key tax-savvy borrowing strategies, including rate swaps used to lock in lower rates.
Rates are on the rise
Rates have risen significantly since the first quarter of 2022, and when rates are higher,
how
you borrow may make an ever greater difference to your real, final costs.Mortgages: How much interest can you deduct?
U.S. taxpayers are allowed to deduct the interest on up to $750,000 of the principal indebtedness that is secured by one of their primary and one of their secondary residences.
This deduction is also available for mortgage refinancing (subject to certain limitations, so be sure to consult your tax advisor).
The rules for older mortgages are slightly different: Mortgage interest due on debt incurred before December 16, 2017, is deductible on up to $1 million of indebtedness. This deduction is also for refinancing debt (again, subject to certain limits)
.
2
Note that the mortgage deduction is available only if loan proceeds are used to build, acquire or make capital improvements on a qualified property.
Also, be very careful to ensure that your loan proceeds can be traced to an identifiable deductible use (the so-called “tracing doctrine”) and that you maintain evidence of this use. Consult your tax advisor to confirm you have the proper documentation.
Borrowing to make taxable investments
As good as the mortgage interest deduction might be, it does not offer a lot of help to those who are buying a more expensive home. For them, it’s helpful to know that borrowing for investment purposes is better, tax-wise, than borrowing to purchase a home.
The reason: You can deduct interest paid on debt proceeds that can be traced to the acquisition of taxable investments (again, evidence is required), up to all of your investment income for that year.
Also (and very importantly): Unlike with mortgages, there is no cap on the amount of principal indebtedness against which you can take this deduction, as long as you have enough investment income (from all sources) to use it against.
Better still: If the investment interest paid in a given year is more than your investment income, any excess deduction can be carried forward indefinitely.
For these purposes, “investment income” generally includes:
Interest (such as from corporate bonds)
Dividends that do not qualify for the preferential 20% top tax rate
Annuities and royalties
Preferentially taxed qualified dividends and long-term capital gains (to the extent the taxpayer elects to have them taxed at ordinary income rates)
Possibly income from private equity investments and hedge funds
However, rental income is generally not considered investment income.
Borrowing to invest in your business
Of the three types of interest deductions, it is the interest paid on business debt that is the most broadly deductible, and thus generally considered the most valuable form of interest expense.
Individuals can deduct interest on the debt they incur to purchase equity or make additional capital contributions to an operating trade or a business organized as a “flow-through” entity for tax purposes (e.g., partnerships, S corporations and certain LLCs).
If the debt proceeds trace directly to operating business use, the principal’s business interest expense should be deductible directly against all of the taxpayer’s income, including non-business income.  Again, substantiation is required to qualify for this deduction.
Here, too, deductibility carries forward: Excess business expenses, including business interest, may be carried forward until fully absorbed against the taxpayer’s income in subsequent years.
Caveats: The taxpayer has to materially participate in the operating business as a principal, which makes this type of interest expense the hardest for which to qualify. Moreover, the business’s assets and debt proceeds must be used solely in the conduct of for-profit operations. And once again, substantiation is required.
Strategize your debt wisely: Basic options
Assume someone wants to buy a $10 million residence and is thinking about borrowing to fund a portion of the purchase price. She has two options:
Get a $4 million mortgage.
But then she could deduct the interest on only $750,000 of the mortgage.
Liquidate $4 million in investments, offsetting gains and losses.
Let’s assume this purchaser uses the cash proceeds from the sale of investments to buy the house, incurring no capital gains in making those sales. Then, at a later date—and, this is important,
unrelated to the home closing
—she borrows $4 million and invests the proceeds in taxable securities. Result: All of the interest on her loan may be deductible.
3
The difference in the tax savings between these two options is potentially significant.
What a difference a tax strategy can make
4Advanced strategy: Integrating rate swaps
Investors and business owners who have either existing debt or who are considering borrowing long-term may wish to fix the interest rate, rather than leave themselves vulnerable to “floating,” or changing, interest rates that are likely to increase.
If you adopt this strategy, you’d be well advised to make sure your loan actually qualifies as a tax-deductible interest expense.
Some people incorrectly believe that if they simply acquire an interest rate “swap” contract that exchanges a floating rate on a loan for fixed-rate periodic payments, they have automatically preserved the deductibility of the interest that will be paid on the new, fixed-rate debt they have.
But that’s not necessarily true.
To effectively fix a rate for tax purposes and to ensure the deductibility of the interest paid, the swap must comply with a variety of additional legal requirements, including the contemporaneous execution of the floating-rate borrowing with the fixed-interest rate contract, as well as similar economic terms in both contracts.
It can be complicated to ensure these conditions are met. However, the tax savings often make the effort very worthwhile.
We can help
All these strategies should be thoroughly discussed with your tax advisors. Your J.P. Morgan team is available to work closely with them and you to help you assess your borrowing (both your needs and the loan’s structuring) so that you put yourself in the best possible position.
Be prepared—no matter where interest rates are.1
Interest on student loans may also be deductible if your adjusted gross income (AGI) is below a modest threshold. In sharp contrast, no deductions are available for interest paid on personal loans, such as car loans and credit card interest.
2
Also grandfathered into the mortgage interest deduction up to the $1 million limit: taxpayers who entered into binding contracts on or before December 15, 2017, to close on the purchase of a principal residence before January 1, 2018, and who purchased the residence before April 1, 2018.
3
Figures are based on the 2023 tax year; actual rates are subject to change.
4
This chart assumes the property meets the Internal Revenue Code’s definition of a qualified residence. Mortgage interest on a qualified residence is only deductible if the mortgage proceeds are used to acquire, construct or substantially improve the property.
The purchaser uses cash proceeds from investment sales to buy the house. After a lapse of time with exposure to market and interest rate risk, the taxpayer takes out a $4 million mortgage on the property and elects for tax purposes to treat the loan as not secured by the qualified residence. Mortgage proceeds are invested in a portfolio of taxable securities, and interest is deducted as an investment expense. This scenario also assumes,
for the sake of simplicity, that the purchaser incurs no capital gains in the process of selling investments to raise liquidity.
Both scenarios assume an interest-only payment structure. If mortgage payments are amortized, the taxpayer’s interest deduction would vary each tax year.
Option 1 assumes interest on $750,000 of principal is deductible. Option 2 assumes that interest on the full amount of principal ($4 million) is deductible.
Both scenarios assume a standard deduction of $27,700 for married joint filers in 2023. The taxpayer is assumed to have other itemized deductions higher than the standard deduction.
Both scenarios assume a 37% U.S. ordinary income tax rate. The investment interest expense deduction also offsets income with respect to the 3.8% Medicare surtax on net investment income. Also assumed: The taxpayer realizes sufficient ordinary investment income in her portfolio to claim the entire investment interest expense deduction.This chart compares the average 30-year fixed rate mortgage in the U.S. to the market yield on U.S. Treasury securities at 10-year constant maturity, from April 1, 2018 to April 1, 2023. These rates follow a similar trajectory. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate starts its course at 4.42% compared to a 10-year Treasury yield of 2.78% in April 2018. Rates fluctuate for a period of time and peak at a high of 4.9% for the 30-year mortgage rate and 3.2% for the 10-year Treasury yield in November 2018.  Rates then generally follow a downward trend with intermittent increases.  The 30-year fixed mortgage rate yield bottoms slightly higher than 2.6% in January 2021, and at the same time, the 10-year Treasury yield is around 1.0%.  In early 2022, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate is around 3.2% and the 10-year Treasury yield is around 1.7%.  Rates have risen since that point.  The latest measurement in the chart shows the 30-year fixed mortgage rate around 6.3% and the 10-year Treasury yield around 3.6%.This chart compares the effective borrowing rate and deduction savings of Option 1 and Option 2.  If structured properly, Option 2 could potentially be far more tax efficient. Option 1 results in potential deduction savings of 0.44% at an effective borrowing rate of 5.81%. Alternatively, Option 2 results in potential deduction savings of 2.56%, at an effective borrowing rate of 3.69%.Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.

Market update
Swirl
There was both bad and good news this week, and stocks and bonds reflected the swirl.
On one hand, questions over
the future of regional banks
remain, and debt ceiling frustration wears on. On the other, inflation shows meaningful signs of abating, with the Federal Reserve narrowing in on pausing its hiking cycle, and corporate earnings have overall been far better than feared.
To break it all down, today we share five dynamics moving the needle in markets—and what it means.
1. Headline inflation has decelerated for 10 straight months—a first in over 100 years.
Evidence of cooling inflation keeps on growing. This week’s read on Consumer Price Inflation (CPI) came in bang on estimates—with both headline and core (ex-food and energy) prices increasing 0.4% on the month in April. That brought the year-over-year gauges to 4.9% for headline, 5.5% for core—still well above what policymakers are comfortable with, but a lot of progress from the highs of 9.1% and 6.6%.
It’s also worth noting that just six months ago, almost 80% of the goods and services in consumers’ price basket were running at a dangerously fast clip north of 6%. Today, that’s down to roughly 40%, while the percentage of components below a 3% pace continues to grow:What’s more, at 5.00–5.25%, the Fed’s policy rate is now officially higher than inflation—yet another sign that this policy is restrictive. All this together (decelerating inflation, tight credit conditions and easing growth) should give the Fed the ammo it needs to pause at its June 14 meeting. Yet, a month is a long time in markets these days—and central bankers will also get another jobs report and CPI print before they get to that meeting.
2. Amid debt ceiling melodrama, markets are pricing more credit risk in the United States than some emerging markets.
The clock is winding down for policymakers to hammer out a deal. Treasury Secretary Yellen has signaled the X-date (the date of potential default) could be as soon as June 1. With bipartisan compromise still out of reach, the cost of credit default swaps, which offer insurance against the probability of the government defaulting on its debt, has soared to record highs, and is now comparable to emerging markets and even junk-rated countries. Treasury bill yields that mature around the X-date have also soared compared to those dated just a few weeks earlier or later.Given the high stakes, we continue to believe Congress will get the job done—most likely by suspending the ceiling until this fall when budget negotiations also kick off. Nonetheless,
crashing through the X-date is still a risk
, and even a scenario where the government keeps up its interest payments (but halts all other discretionary spending) to technically avoid default would still have adverse economic and market implications.
3. But even with all the uncertainty, 2022’s pain is drifting away—stocks are now higher over the last 12 months.
U.S., Europe and even Chinese stocks are in the green over the last year. Up until April, the S&P 500 had a negative year-over-year return for 12 months in a row—that’s only happened eight other times since 1950.
While there’s never a guarantee of future returns (and we expect volatility in the months ahead), historically that’s boded well for stocks moving forward. In each of those eight other times, the S&P 500 was up an average of 18% a year later.All this jives with our view that stocks are forward-looking machines, selling off last year in anticipation of weaker growth to come and setting the stage for stronger markets this year.
4. Call it a comeback—earnings expectations are moving higher again.
Dare we say again that this earnings season has been impressive? S&P 500 companies are expected to round out Q1 with a -2.5% slowdown in earnings, up from estimates for over -7% heading into the quarter. Assuming the rest of this season’s reports keep pace (only roughly 8% of companies are left), it would mark the biggest turnaround we’ve seen since COVID times.
Even more impressive: A look under the hood shows that the median company has actually grown earnings by over 1%. And after over six months of adjusting for a weaker outlook, expectations for future earnings have turned a corner and are rising.5. Treasury bills now offer the same yield as investment grade bonds.
Earlier this week, 1-month Treasury bill yields caught up to investment grade bond yields for the first time on record—both are yielding around 5.4%. But while a yield that high for lower risk cash and cash-like instruments may look good now, we don’t think those yields will last.With the Fed’s hiking cycle at or nearly at its end, reinvestment risk is real. When a recession hits, the Fed tends to cut rates by about 300 basis points (bps) in the following year. Today, markets are pricing in about 150 bps of cuts over the next 12 months, suggesting there’s more room for interest rates to fall from here.
That’s led investment grade and municipal bonds to meaningfully outperform rolling T-bills in environments like this in the past. Following the Fed’s last hike over the past seven cycles, U.S investment grade bonds have outperformed T-bills by roughly 14% on average (27% bond return versus 13% in T-bills). Finally, with inflation still around 5%, the real yield on T-bills is pretty much flat right now.Your J.P.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.Recent abrupt market moves, the U.S. economy stuck in a holding pattern, and a bumpy road ahead. Our response: to be even more intentional in our risk taking.Market Thoughts: Holding the reins tight
Data dependency is the current approach to monetary policy. The fallacy of ‘no landing’ for the global economy continues to stream from pundits. We’re going to land. It’s a question of when and how hard.
The operative market question today is: “Are the flashpoints we’ve seen across the U.S. banking sector idiosyncratic or systemic?” I believe both. The root cause is the pace of rising interest rates.
There is a lot being written about whether the U.S. Government will choose to default on its debt. That should never be a question. The tail risk is small, but real.
Given market volatility, it’s an environment where we are being very intentional in our risk taking. Volatility can create opportunity. Untethered volatility can do the opposite.
With an ongoing tug of war between recessionists and optimists, some ‘fog of war’ has been lifting. But an all-clear bell isn’t ready to be rung.
Macro data is volatile; so are markets. Investors still don’t know enough about what lies ahead. Trends are tough to read in a transitionary environment.
The fear of missing out had modestly crept back into the market narrative. The irony is that sidelined cash may keep a relative floor on how far markets correct. Have fun with family and friends. Ask who’s waiting to buy an equity market selloff. Then toss in “At what level?” My sense is most people will say 5-10% lower. It’s always 5-10% lower.
Range-bound is likely the right way to describe current markets. We’ve been trading the same broad ranges on the S&P 500 for most of this year. Sidelined cash may not let us re-test last October’s low unless something really goes wrong.
Helplessly hoping
.
Dogmatically data dependent is how I’d characterize the current approach to monetary policy. That, or “confusion has its cost.” It’s a line from Crosby, Stills & Nash’s song “Helplessly Hoping.” A fitting inflation fighting mantra.
The Federal Reserve (Fed) set itself up for a potential June pause in rate hikes. We’ll see. Their pace of tightening has been faster and more assertive than anything seen since the 1980s, with ten back-to-back hikes totaling 500bps in a little more than one year. We are back to policy rate levels last seen in 2007.
Not only does monetary policy act with a lag, but banks pulling back on credit is an added drag on the global economy, equating to more tightening. If I were sitting at the Fed, I’d hit pause in June. Time is on their side; they’ve done a lot of heavy lifting.
We continue to see inflation in cool down mode, but it’s still too high. Recent U.S. economic data showed wages strong yet coming off the boil. The same can be said more broadly for the labor market. The economy is slowing and in ‘OK’ shape. All of that is good news for the soft landing crowd. But it keeps the Fed keenly aware their fight against inflation is far from over.
Having hiked 25bps in May, the European Central Bank (ECB) left the door wide open for more rate hikes. Like the Fed, they have forcefully increased interest rates (Figure 1). The ECB has hiked 375bps in about a year. We are back to levels last seen in 2008.The ECB has a single price stability mandate. The Fed’s dual mandate includes price stability and maximizing employment. If the Fed is on hold for June and the ECB presses on, the euro should retain its recent strength.
The fallacy of ‘no landing’ continues to stream from pundits. For anyone that’s ever ‘enjoyed’ being stuck on a plane in a holding pattern, circling is a better analogy than no landing for the economy.
We’re going to land. It’s a question of when and how hard.
Idiosyncratic or systemic?
To say the past few months have been a whirlwind for markets doesn’t begin to describe it.
The operative question today is: “Are the flashpoints we’ve seen across the U.S. banking sector idiosyncratic or systemic?” I believe both.
The root cause—rising interest rates—is systemic. The issues that caused certain banks to fail appear idiosyncratic. But I don’t believe we’re done seeing smaller shocks to the system. I say that because of the pace with which rates have risen.
Investors recognize in a higher interest rate environment that bank balance sheets are liability sensitive. The key question? Whether the headlines and negative price action provoke renewed deposit outflows. That’s the perfect negative feedback loop for short sellers.
For all the bandying about of the word ‘crisis,’ we’re not in bank crisis mode. We’re stuck in a moment of rightful investor concern and banking sector driven stress. What we’re seeing feels more like the Savings & Loans (S&L) crisis in the 1980s than the 2007-2008 global financial crisis (GFC). That’s good and bad news. The S&L crisis proved a ‘slow-bleed’ on the economy. The GFC defined shock and awe.
Actions taken to date by regulators have signaled their willingness to do more, as needed. The moral hazard arguments being made about encouraging bad (or inept) bank management teams taking on risk at the expense of taxpayers is one that regulators and Washington will need to address.
A wild ride.
At the start of this year I would have said the risk of recession in the U.S. was about one-third. After events the past few months, it’s a coin toss. If we get a series of added shocks to the banking system, the risk of a hard landing will quickly creep into scope. The macro data simply isn’t showing that currently. That can change.
We’re seeing a slowing global economy. As base case, I’m anchored on a narrow path to soft landing or a shallow recession. But the outlook is cloudy due to rising tail risks. I’m watching credit markets closely. They’ve been bumpy, but so far haven’t shown concern of a hard landing. They are, however, showing signs of modest stress. Credit markets are a dependable canary in the coalmine. So are banks.
Fixed income markets continue their wild ride. That said, risk assets remain supported. Big tech has driven U.S. equity market returns this year. We’re far from all-clear on risk assets. The steepness of the U.S. Government bond yield curve inversion remains dialed to levels not seen in over 40 years (Figure 2). Some of that is technically driven by trend following shorts forced to unwind positions. Some of it is fundamentally driven, based on a hard landing outlook.The economy is slowing, as is inflation. Jobs data remains hardy. The U.S. economy doesn’t look like it’s quickly slipping into recession. That’s good news for consumption and revenue growth. So far, it’s been good for corporate margins as well, which remain above historic levels.
I expect S&P 500 margins will continue to move back towards long-term trend levels, about 11% looking back ten years and 10% over the past twenty years. Margins currently hover right around 11.5%. They peaked in the first quarter of 2022 at around 13.5%.
Freight demand continues to trend lower along with supply chain activity. Broad commodity prices continue to roll over as well, especially energy and food. Central banks are getting what they’re after. The question is how much higher policy rates need to go before this tightening cycle ends.
Debt crisis redux.
There is a lot being written about whether the U.S. Government will choose to default on its debt. I view a lot of that as headline filler. The debt ceiling will be increased. There is no choice. The question is how long this can be pushed out before markets push back.
To borrow a line from Jay Powell, we shouldn’t be talking about a world where the U.S. doesn’t pay its bills. That said, never is a word I stopped using after the 2007-2008 global financial crisis. Every nation needs to be mindful of its debt load. Debt levels globally are too high, including the U.S. They need serious address, not political theatre.
We are watching events unfold in Washington closely. The tail risk may be small, but it’s real. We’ve already seen U.S. Government credit default swaps (CDS) push out to levels we haven’t seen since 2011-2012. I’m keeping an eye on U.S. CDS as it’s something that shouldn’t move. When it does it reflects investor concern, hedging expected market turbulence ahead.
If things get pushed to the wire and markets truly become unhinged, we would likely be buyers of U.S. Government bonds and risk assets.
Holding the reins tight.
Given the abrupt moves we’re seeing, it’s a market environment where we continue to be very intentional in our risk taking. Volatility can create opportunity. Untethered volatility can do the opposite. The volatility we’ve seen over the past year has weighed heavily on animal spirits (Figure 3). There simply isn’t trust in the near-term outlook… it’s going to take time to rebuild.We added earlier this year to European equities, funded from the U.S. I viewed that shift as defensive repositioning, with upside potential. Europe is attractively valued both to its own history as well as relative to the U.S. In a broad market pullback, I expect Europe’s lower valuation to provide better down-capture relative to the U.S. Should the global economy surprise positively, Europe offers an opportunity for further re-rating. It’s already run hard, helping year to date portfolio performance.
We retain a modest overweight in portfolios to extended credit. We’ve been trimming those positions since last year, adding to investment grade credit both in Europe and the U.S. We’ve been de-risking, moving up in credit quality. We’ve also added to longer maturity Government bonds last year as rates pressed higher.
Bonds are playing a key role as risk diversifiers in portfolios. Given the recent pullback in long-term interest rates, we’ve had some active discussions about our duration positioning both in multi-asset as well as fixed income portfolios.
With the outlook murky and markets on edge, we’re holding onto core bond duration. We’re better buyers of credit, especially investment grade (IG), should we see spreads gap out. Both European and U.S. IG aren’t attractive enough to lean further into. They’re on the shopping list.
We have a bumpy ride ahead. We’re not being paid to take big market bets. Recognizing the noise clouding the macro and market landscape, holding the reins tight on risk continues to feel like the right course of action.
INDEX DEFINITIONS
The S&P 500® is widely regarded as the best single gauge of large-cap U.S. equities. The index includes 500 leading companies and covers approximately 80% of available market capitalization.
The VIX Index is a calculation designed to produce a measure of constant, 30-day expected volatility of the U.S. stock market, derived from real-time, mid-quote prices of S&P 500® Index call and put options. On a global basis, it is one of the most recognized measures of volatility - widely reported by financial media and closely followed by a variety of market participants as a daily market indicator.
The ICE BofA MOVE Index is a yield curve weighted index of the normalized implied volatility on 1-month Treasury options. It is the weighted average of volatilities on the CT2, CT5, CT10 and CT30 (i.e., weighted average of 1m2y, 1m5y, 1m10y and 1m30y Treasury implied vols with weights of 20%, 20%, 40% and 20%, respectively).Line chart as of May 2023 showing U.S. and euro area central bank policy rates shown in percentage terms on the y-axis with monthly data points since 2003 on the x-axis. A footnote details that for the euro area, the deposit facility rate is shown. Heading into 2005, the U.S. hiked forcefully to 5.3%; while the euro area started hiking in early 2006, reaching a peak rate of 3.3% by 2008. In 2009, policy rates hovered around zero for both regions. The euro area hiked to 0.8% in late 2011 while the U.S. remained steady. U.S. policy rates began to increase in 2016, realizing a peak of 2.4% by July 2019. However, euro area policy rates decreased over this period to -0.5% by late 2019. After hovering around or below zero since early 2020, policy rates have increased in both regions as their central banks aggressively hiked; with the U.S. at 5.1% and euro area 3.3% most recently.Line chart of the U.S. Government bond yield curve (defined as the U.S. 10 Year Treasury Bond – 3 Month Treasury-Bill yield spread) shown in basis points on the y-axis and displayed with monthly data points since 1981 through April 2023 on the x-axis. As of April 2023, the yield curve displays a deep inversion of -160bps, a level which hasn’t been seen since 1981. The dashed line indicates an average value of 168bps over the time period shown. Inversions were also seen in 1981 (inverted by -160bps), 1989 (-30bps), 2000 (-78bps), 2007 (-56bps) and 2019 (-48bps). Those prior inversions were followed by economic recessions as defined by NBER, which are indicated by shaded areas.Line chart of the VIX (left axis) and MOVE (right axis) Indexes shown in level terms on separate y-axes. The time series are displayed since 2017 through May 11th, 2023 on the x-axis; using daily data. From 2017 to early February 2020, the MOVE Index hovered between 40-90. In March of 2020, the VIX and MOVE Index each jumped to very high levels of 83 and 164, respectively. Since then, the VIX Index has generally been within 15-40. On the other hand, the MOVE Index again reached those very high levels in 2022, and remains elevated vs history. It reached an all-time high of 199 over the time period shown in March 2023.Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.We all have different motivations for why we invest. Some individuals hope to generate enough income to sustain their lifestyles. Others may be seeking ways to grow their wealth over decades, whether to fund a legacy for generations or a comfortable retirement. Financial goals are unique for every individual.
That said, many of the challenges facing today’s investors are universal: The revival of inflation calls for the pursuit of higher expected returns to grow purchasing power over time. Alpha opportunities have generally become harder to find in “traditional” stocks and bonds, and last year’s selloff in bonds left investors seeking more reliable portfolio protectors. Also, the appetite for steady income generation is ever-present.
Alternative investments can help investors solve for many of these challenges. Below, we explore three primary roles they can play in portfolios: Access to broader opportunity sets, enhanced diversification and premium income generation potential.
1. Access to a broader opportunity set of long-term growth potential
Historically, equities have enabled investors to grow their capital over time. However, we have seen a 45% decline in the number of publicly traded companies since 2000,
1
and there are now over 7x more private companies than public companies with $100 million in revenue.
2
Limiting your investment approach to public markets means missing out on the vast opportunity set in private markets.
Private equity managers often take a hands-on approach, driving operational improvements in portfolio companies. With this expanded access and more comprehensive toolkit, private equity has consistently outperformed global public equity markets by 5–10% annually (see chart below).2.
Portfolio diversification for when the going gets tough
2022 brought the worst year for the stock market since 2008, and the worst year for core bonds on record, leaving many investors seeking ways to better diversify their portfolios.
Enter hedge funds. Hedge funds may help reduce portfolio volatility by using hedging strategies and accessing niche exposures that may generate uncorrelated return streams. Therefore, hedge funds may help a portfolio to compound more efficiently.
Real assets, too, can act as powerful diversifiers in a portfolio. Infrastructure assets, in particular, can offer exposure to essential services with resilient demand and inflation-linked revenue. Similarly, real estate tend to offer historically low correlation to public markets, including publicly traded REITs.
3. Attractive yield generation
J.P. Morgan’s 2023 Long-Term Capital Market Assumptions estimate that total returns in U.S. investment grade bonds could average 4.6% per year over a 10-year investment horizon, but with an average inflation assumption of 2.6%, the real return prospects look less compelling.
3
Investors navigating the universe of publicly traded bonds must often accept lower credit quality if they seek higher return potential. For those investors, private credit may be worth a look. Private credit historically has offered premium yields and returns with greater structural protections relative to other fixed income opportunities.
4
To boot, as the size of the average high yield borrower has grown, many borrowers are too small to tap into public credit markets; conversely, larger companies may not want to risk the uncertainty or lengthy processes that come with accessing traditional capital markets. Private lenders can fill this financing gap, offering their investors the chance to collect a premium for providing capital where it’s scarce.We can help
Those with the desire—or need—to overcome today’s investment challenges would be remiss not to consider alternative investments.
As always—but especially in alternatives—due diligence and selectivity are essential, as performance can vary widely.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.The reasons most people put off signing a will are complex and personal. But after you read this, you could be ready.Jeff Kreisler, Head of Behavioral Science for J.P. Morgan Private Bank
Sally Venverloh, Managing Director, Wealth Advisor
Aretha Franklin, the “Queen of Soul,” not only lives on as a Motown legend, but also as a public reminder why everyone—and we do mean
everyon
e, from the moneyed super-famous to part-time kindergarten teachers—should have a will and keep it up to date.
Ms. Franklin, whom
Rolling Stone
magazine twice named the greatest singer of all time, died on August 16, 2018, leaving an estimated fortune of $80 million, but no signed will. Ever since her death, her four sons have been fighting over her estate. As recently as April 2023, they were before a probate judge in Detroit, still battling.
Of course, a famous singer’s story makes headlines. But apart from Ms. Franklin’s celebrity, this tale is almost commonplace. At the Private Bank, we see a great number of otherwise savvy people who have not done any actual estate planning. Even many of those who have estate plans neglect to revise their estate planning documents as their wealth increases and families change.
Far too often, the lack of an estate plan results in disputes and hard feelings among the surviving heirs. The wealthy are warned again and again about this sad potential outcome. Yet a lot of people put off estate planning, don’t sign key documents or fail to keep their plans current.
Why? The reasons, though complex and personal, fall into clear categories. If any of these resonate with you, it’s time to explore ways to overcome the roadblocks that are preventing you from taking care of your family’s future.
Natural feelings
Many people fail to complete or maintain their estate plans because they:
Are not thinking about the future
—Many of us, particularly those working in C-suites or running private businesses, are so focused on what is happening in our present lives that it is difficult to connect to what might happen after we’re gone. And it’s too easy to keep telling ourselves that we’ll get to our estate plans when it’s more convenient. Or maybe we’re convincing ourselves that our children will be reasonable when the time comes; they can handle it; or there is enough money to go around.
Lack the time
—For almost everyone, it’s easier to attend to the most expedient tasks rather than those that require time, care, thought and lawyers.
Fear loss of control
—Some people feel it is pointless to make an estate plan because, in their absence, their influence will inevitably wane. “I can’t control what happens when I’m gone.” The truth is that a strategic, well-thought-out estate plan that clarifies your intentions can be a powerful source of inspiration, guidance and influence for your heirs.
Fear mortality
—No one likes to contemplate their demise.
Must make difficult decisions
—Putting an estate plan together is likely to force a person to make difficult decisions, large and small. Who’ll run your business after you are gone? Should you leave the same amount to all your children when one earns a substantial salary and another struggles? Who’ll get which piece of family jewelry and art?
Facing facts
Step one in getting past any natural hesitancy you may have in engaging in estate planning is, unfortunately, allowing yourself to face how disastrous your failure to address these matters might be for the people you love.
Downsides could include:
Family discord
—Perhaps the greatest tragedy of passing away without an estate plan is that it often results in disharmony among family members. Arguments over who is the rightful owner of which asset too often escalate into costly litigation that runs a real risk of damaging, even destroying, familial relationships.
Forced sale of assets to pay estate tax
—Failure to plan for an estate tax bill can force a fire sale of illiquid assets, especially business interests. For people who have a net worth in excess of the U.S. estate tax exclusion (currently $12.92 million per person; $25.84 million for a married couple), a 40% U.S. estate tax on that excess will generally be due nine months after death.
Delay in transfer of assets to heirs
—When people die without an estate plan, their assets must go through probate, and the estate may be involved in litigation if various “heirs” lay claim to the assets.
Greater transaction costs
—An incomplete or nonexistent estate plan is likely to cost your family. Attorneys’ fees will likely be higher. And if there is litigation, costs could seriously reduce your beneficiaries’ inheritances.
State intestacy statutes
—When someone passes away without a will, state law will dictate what happens to his or her assets. That usually means your assets will go to some combination of the surviving spouse, children and perhaps parents and siblings. This forced distribution scheme may be inconsistent with your wishes.
Getting started
So how do you get over your hesitancy? We have a few tips:
Know that it is normal to be reluctant about an estate plan.
According to a 2021 Gallup poll, less than half—only about 46%—of U.S. adults have a will; this polling result has not varied significantly over the past 30 years.
1
Imagine the future.
Allow yourself to envision what would happen to your family, friends and charities if something should happen to you. What do you want your wealth to do for them after you are gone? Be specific. Focus on how happy you will feel knowing you’ve provided for your family’s future in an organized and thoughtful way.
Prioritize.
Advise yourself. We often give better advice to others than we do to ourselves. Perhaps more importantly, we can be kinder to others than we are to ourselves. So imagine your best friend came to you and said, “My advisor thinks I should make an estate plan, but I think I should just deal with my current challenges.” What would you say?
Take control of the future.
Realize that estate planning is a process. An estate plan memorializes your decisions about what you want to happen to your wealth and how you want to provide for your loved ones after you pass. Who will control the wealth? Who will enjoy it? And remember, as long as you are alive and competent, you can change your estate plan at any time.
We can help
It’s easy to get started.
Just let your J.P. Morgan team know you’re thinking about creating an estate plan. They can explain the basics, recommend an estate planning attorney, and work closely with that lawyer to help you ensure your wealth plans support the hopes and dreams you have for your family’s future.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.A 529 is a tax-efficient way to pay for college—to a point. Beware of the tax implications and know there may be other good options for youJordan Sprechman
, Practice Lead, U.S. Wealth Advisory
Cheyenne Del Savio, Tax Advisory
The results are in: A new J.P. Morgan study finds that a 529 account is the most tax-efficient way to save for a student’s education—but only if that account is depleted by the time the student completes their education.
2
Further, our analysis of the 529 plans’ 25-year history found that these accounts:
Work best as a vehicle for funding the education of a single beneficiary and/or relatives of the same generation.
Are not a good way to create an educational nest egg for multiple generations.
Indeed, if one’s aim is to build wealth for multiple generations, the most tax-efficient choices could be the
pay-as-you-go
approach to funding education—or creating Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) accounts for members of younger generations.
The tax cost of overfunding a 529 account
Some taxpayers have deliberately overfunded 529 accounts, thinking they would benefit multiple generations by doing so.
This can be a mistake—as they will likely find themselves facing an unpleasant (
i.e.
, taxable) choice when the initial beneficiary finishes school:
They could take back the money in the 529 account, or give it to the student. However, in both cases, taxes and penalties must be paid on the earnings at the recipient’s ordinary income tax rate.
1
Or, they could pass the account on to a lower generation (e.g., grandchildren). But there would be a tax price for this option as well. The initial beneficiary might have to use some of the $12.92 million gift tax exclusion when a new beneficiary is named.
Weigh your options
Consider the choices a father (Tom) had for funding the education of a daughter (Jane) born on January 1, 2000, around three years after Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code was enacted. Tom could have:
Taken a
pay-as-you-go
approach
—Paid Jane’s higher education costs as she incurred them, understanding the risks involved. (Would he still have enough money? Would he still be alive?)
Funded an UTMA account
—Funded the account annually with the annual exclusion amount ($10,000 in 2000, now $17,000). Jane would have gained full control of any assets in the account when she turned 21 (per the law in most states).
Set up a trust for Jane’s benefit
—Funded a trust each year with the annual exclusion amount, accepting that trusts (especially smaller ones) are costlier to create and administer than UTMA accounts. A
grantor
trust (i.e., the grantor pays the tax on trust income) would be more tax efficient than a
non-grantor
trust (the trust or beneficiary pays the taxes).
Funded or super-funded a 529 account
—Funded a 529 account with the annual exclusion amount. Or, as the law allows, super-funded a 529 account with five times the annual exclusion amount. Tom chose to super-fund in 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2020.
2The tax bill comes due
When Jane graduated, Tom had to deal with the assets remaining in the account. One potential option—to name as a new beneficiary another child or relative in the same generation as Jane—was not available to him. Thus, Tom’s choices were:
Take the distribution himself.
Tom could take back the assets and pay taxes on the earnings (not on the original contribution), which would be subject to income tax at ordinary rates, plus a 10% penalty. Tom is in the highest tax bracket (which he would be if he were single and his taxable income exceeded $578,125 in 2023), that would mean a 37% levy on the earnings, plus the penalty. Sending the funds back upstream to Tom would also mean a 40% estate tax bill on the future value of the distribution (Assuming that Tom has a taxable estate).
Distribute everything to Jane.
The advantage here is that Jane would probably be in a lower tax bracket than Tom and, as noted earlier, can contribute at least some of the account balance to a Roth IRA. If she were earning the average salary of a recent college graduate (around $59,000), she would be in the 22% bracket. Thus, even if Tom were to distribute to her all $495,000—not all of which would be considered earnings subject to tax and penalty—it is possible that none of that distribution would be subject to tax at 37%.
4
Name a new beneficiary in a lower generation
(presumably a grandchild). The problem with this approach is that proposed regulations would consider this change a gift
by Jane
of the account balance (not just the earnings) to the new beneficiary. As such, it would consume some of Jane’s lifetime gift-tax exclusion (currently, $12.92 million)—although the impact of the gift would be ameliorated by Jane’s use of her $17,000 annual exclusion. Our analysis shows this is economically among the
least
attractive alternatives.A more tax-efficient path
In sum: A 529 account is the most tax-efficient education savings alternative, but only if the account is exhausted when the student’s education is completed.
If a significant balance remains when a student’s education is completed (as in our example): After factoring in the taxes and penalties due after a distribution to either Tom or Jane, or after naming a new beneficiary, distributing to Jane is the most tax-efficient approach after naming a same-generation beneficiary.
Remember the states
One additional thought: States treat 529 accounts differently. For example, some states allow for state income tax deductions for the amount contributed; others don’t. Similarly, only some states allow for tax-free payments of up to $10,000 of qualified education expenses for kindergarten through 12th grade (a provision Congress adopted in 2017). In considering the impact of 529 accounts on family wealth, bear in mind the impact of state tax laws as well.
We can help
Your J.P. Morgan team can help you evaluate various options for funding education expenses for younger family members. For more information, ask your J.P. Morgan team for a copy of
The Well-Prepared Family: Funding Education.1
The so-called SECURE Act 2.0, enacted in December 2022, will allow a 529 beneficiary, starting Jan. 1, 2024, to contribute, without tax or penalty, up to $35,000 from a 529 account to a Roth IRA, as long as the 529 account has been in existence for at least five years.  The annual contribution amount remains limited to the general Roth limitations of, in most cases, $6,500 per year.
2
In fact, most 529 accounts do get spent on a student’s education. Industry data indicates that the average 529 account has a balance of $26,000, which is equivalent to less than one year’s tuition at most private colleges.
3
On occasion, grandparents who want to give assets directly to their grandchildren and more remote generations will create and fund a Health and Education Exclusion Trust. HEETs allow a family to set aside funds in perpetuity solely for health and education expenses. However, at least one trust beneficiary must be a charitable organization to which distributions should be made at least annually.
4
Another way to ameliorate the impact of the tax and penalties on distributions either to Jane or Tom would be to spread distributions to the recipient over more than one year. If this approach were taken, it could be that none of the earnings distributed would be taxed at the top marginal rate.

Please tell us about yourself, and our team will contact you.No matter where markets are heading next, we see opportunity. Consider these strategies to be ready for the next meaningful move.Our Top Market Takeaways for May 19, 2023
Market update
Breakdown, breakout, or rangebound?
Times are tricky. The market narrative flits from soft to hard to no landing in as quickly as a day’s time. Some look at the S&P 500’s 10% year-to-date rally and find comfort—others see a flashing warning sign.
Is the market headed for a breakdown, a breakout, or will it just stay rangebound? Today, we explore the paths forward and offer our take.
Breakdown
Rate hikes have consequences, and with inflation stubborn and sticky at 4–5%, the risk is that the Federal Reserve has to do even more (markets are already betting on a 40% chance of another hike next month). Bank stress seems to rear its head every few weeks, and even if it doesn’t unwind into a full-blown crisis of confidence, the flow of credit to the economy is drying up. Banks are tightening lending standards, and some measures for loan demand are at their weakest since 2009. Ripples are already being felt in the
office real estate sector
.With costs high and credit getting scarcer, companies may struggle to turn a profit and cut costs, including through layoffs. Job openings are now at their lowest in almost two years, and employees seem to be less confident in finding another job if they need to—it’s only a matter of time before the cracks expand into full-blown layoffs. With fewer jobs to go around, the consumer tends to become either less willing or less able to spend. That puts a stopper on economic activity—and that’s not even layering in the fallout risk from the still unresolved
debt ceiling debate
.
That foreboding backdrop mobilizes bears that think the stock rally just can’t last. Even with Q1 earnings season shaping up as better than expected the last few weeks, the S&P 500 has traded pretty much flat through it all. What’s more, many of this year’s gains have been thanks to big tech leading the charge: Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Meta, Amazon and Alphabet have contributed about 8.3% out of the S&P 500’s 10.0% year-to-date rally.
All that leaves the market expensive for a gloomy outlook, and the tradeoff between stocks and bonds not all that compelling. The forward P/E multiple of the S&P 500 is nearing 18.5x again, and the spread between what you can yield from earnings and what you can get from bonds is the tightest of the last 10 years.Breakout
The market has climbed the wall of worry. And it’s not without reason: The economy is defying gravity, and by some measures, it’s improving.
Houses seem to be selling again, and homebuilder sentiment has increased for five straight months, now at its highest since last July. Manufacturing looks like it’s turning a corner: Yesterday’s read on the Philadelphia Fed’s Manufacturing for April came in way above expectations. What’s more, after an initial step-up at the start of the year, the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment hasn’t really budged since March. There are also still 1.6 job openings for every unemployed person.This all might be problematic if inflation was also reaccelerating—but today’s signs suggest the opposite. Taking a cue from last week’s U.S. CPI report, shelter prices finally seem to be slowing, the Fed’s “supercore” core services ex-shelter measure (which is closely tied to the labor market) saw its softest gain since last July, and outside of used autos, core goods inflation saw its slowest pace in over two years.
Better growth with cooling inflation is a “chef’s kiss” backdrop for stocks. A closer look suggests it’s not all just tech, either. Almost 80% of S&P 500 companies reported earnings that were better than expected (the highest beat rate since 2021 and above the 10-year average), and estimates for earnings in the year ahead are broadly increasing. There are also 35 companies in the S&P 500 that are currently within 1% of their 52-week highs, and only five (Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft, Meta and NVIDIA) are in the mega-cap tech category.
In all, it’s now been over seven months since the S&P 500 hit its lows back in October—that tends to mean the lows are in, and it also tends to bode well for future returns. When the S&P 500 has made it seven months or more without a new low in the past, it’s been higher 86% of the time over the following year.Rangebound
Things are just OK—they’re not great, but they’re not bad either. Economic momentum is slowing, and a recession is still probable, but it doesn’t seem like it’s all going to fall off a cliff. Bank stress and debt ceiling negotiations are still a risk, but seem to be getting better. Valuations are high—and that may limit the amount of upside from here—but it also seems like the worst is behind us. After all, stocks and bonds already went through a reckoning last year in anticipation of weaker growth this year.
The consumer (who makes up some 70% of the U.S. economy) offers a good illustration. According to the latest credit and debit card data from Bank of America, household spending fell -1.2% year-over-year in April—the first decline since February 2021. But under the hood, lower-income households—which have little to no excess savings still on hand—are actually outspending their higher-income peers (in large thanks to that still strong jobs market). Earnings from retail giants this week, such as Walmart, Target and Home Depot, likewise echoed this sentiment, all reporting earnings beats but noting customers are getting thriftier with their purchases.
The S&P has now gone six weeks without a 1% weekly move in either direction—the longest stretch since the summer of 2019. As a shrinking supply of credit crunches its way through the economy, that choppiness could continue as different sectors slow at different times.
Where we land
We’re in the rangebound to cautiously optimistic camp. At an index level, we think stocks will be higher both six and 12 months from now. But even if the summer sees a sprint, the whole process may be wrought with fits and starts along the way. While that might feel hard to navigate at times, we see opportunities.
Sectors like reasonably priced technology and healthcare, as well as ex-U.S. markets, can provide relative safety in stormier weather, while small and mid-cap stocks can help position for the next cycle as this one ages. In the meantime, choppy markets can be the bread and butter of strategies like structured notes and hedge funds, which can offer nervous investors a way to capitalize on the upside and protect on the downside. We also think bonds can offer strong returns in a world where growth takes a hit or where inflation slows without too much damage.
In all, both a breakdown or breakout are possible, but for either path, a multi-asset class portfolio may be best served to help you prepare. Your J.P.

Summary
. I have recommended since 2009 that equity investors overweight the US and Emerging Markets, and underweight Europe and Japan. The excess returns from such a strategy when applied to regional MSCI equity indexes have been enormous over that time frame. However, the time has come to retire the barbell for a while. I stayed too long at the fair, and should have made this recommendation a few months ago when Europe was trading at a record 35% P/E discount to the US. A modestly brighter picture in Japan relative to China is another reason why it’s time to put the barbell aside for now.
[1]
The barbell’s amazing run.
The barbell’s performance since 1988 is shown in the first two charts using both a three-year and two-year performance horizon. Before its underperformance this year, the barbell had a remarkable streak
1
. In other words, the -120 bps of barbell underperformance over the last two years is small relative to the consistency and magnitude of prior barbell outperformance. Note that the worst period for the barbell was the golden era for Europe in 2005-2007; more on that below.Most of the barbell outperformance since 2009 is due to US outperformance vs Europe, rather than Emerging Markets outperformance vs Japan
. As shown below, the impact of overweighting Emerging Markets vs Japan was split between positive results from 2009 to 2013, underperformance from 2014 to 2019 and no material impact since 2019.[2] Why the US outperformed Europe since 2009
. The next chart decomposes reasons for US outperformance vs Europe over this period. The 5 largest factors: outperformance of the US dollar vs the Euro (illustrated in the chart above); the benefit of US sector weights which are larger in Tech and lower in Financials, Energy, Industrials and Staples; and the outperformance of US tech stocks, consumer discretionary and financials vs their European counterparts. These factors explain almost all US outperformance since 2009; only 7% of the outperformance is unaccounted for.[3]
What’s been driving recent barbell underperformance
. Since September 2022, Europe has outperformed the US by ~20%. As shown below, 2/3 of this outperformance is due
simply to the decline in the dollar
vs the Euro
. As we wrote last time (see Archives), while we do not see the dollar’s reserve currency status under serious threat, there’s room for the dollar to decline due to its prior sharp rise vs other currencies.
What else explains Europe’s outperformance
? The other positive for Europe: outperformance of its Consumer Discretionary stocks vs US counterparts. The next largest factor: relative outperformance of EU financials, but it’s small in the context of overall European outperformance. That gap may widen further given US regional bank commercial real estate exposure, which we wrote about on April 10. But I’m reluctant to base a long Europe strategy on the reported strength of its banks. The April 10 Eye on the Market also showed how Credit Suisse ranked at or near the top of EU bank statistics on capital, leverage, liquidity and funding ratios and still failed. Certain risks are just hard to capture in balance sheet ratios.
What explains Japan’s 11% outperformance vs EM since last fall
? One factor is a resurgence in M&A activity in Japan, which is unusual. Much of the recent rise comes from foreign investors, which is even rarer: Bain’s acquisitions of Hitachi Metals for $5.6 bn, Evident for $3.1 bn and Gelato Pique for $1.4 bn; KKR’s acquisition of Hitachi Transport for $5.2 bn; and the Fortress acquisition of Seven & i for $1.8 bn. More on Japan below.[4]
The 2005-2007 era is not a useful parallel for projecting another period of European outperformance
. I’ve seen research citing Europe’s earnings surge in 2005-2007 as a reason for being overweight Europe, since it could happen again as structural banking and energy constraints fade. But I don’t buy that argument: Europe’s earnings surge at the time was heavily influenced explosive bank lending that’s unlikely to repeat itself. See the charts below: bank lending has picked up in Germany and to a lesser degree in France, but in Southern Europe it never recovered. Maybe there’s some other rationale for projecting an earnings surge in Europe; the 2005-2007 period is not it.[5]
Given higher sector weights in staples, financials, energy and utilities,
Europe is essentially a value investment. I should have paid more attention to just how cheap it got, particularly after the Euro had declined by 50% vs the US$ since 2010.
By September 2022, Europe’s P/E multiple hit a post-2006
2
low relative to the US. While there were valid concerns at the time about Europe’s energy situation, rising inflation and exposure to a shuttered China, investors were receiving an enormous discount for taking European equity exposure, and I should have paid more attention to that. Europe’s outperformance is likely to have a ceiling since US companies generate higher returns on equity and higher returns on assets, as shown in the table.
But everything has a price, and a 35% P/E discount was apparently it
. As things stand now, the discount is still large from an historical perspective.Wrapping up
. Since the valuation discount remains high, there might be some legs left in the anti-barbell trade. Another reason:
Japan looks interesting again
(see box), particularly relative to China which has risen to ~40% of the EM equity index and which still has a lot of problems. I wouldn’t argue for a
reverse
barbell, which would overweight Europe and Japan; I don’t have enough conviction in European equities for that, particularly with the ECB having more tightening to do. I also think that the US debt ceiling will be raised, one way or another
3
.
But I do think that the barbell’s best days are behind it for a while, and believe that investors should proceed with more regional balance in global equity portfolios
.Japanese equities may benefit from the following catalysts:
Japanese
equities trade at 25%-30% P/E discount to US, as they have since 2016
Record increase in stock buybacks driven by corporate governance reforms (i.e., Sony spinoff/buyback)
Governance reforms: [a] ~50% of companies trade below book value and must outline a plan to maximize shareholder value and comply with shareholder, liquidity and outside director reforms; [b] 10%-20% of companies do not comply with cross-holding and free float criteria and must remedy or face delisting
Half of Japanese companies have positive net cash positions vs <20% in the US/Europe
Very low positioning in Japanese equities by non-Japanese investors
A recent surge in non-Japanese LBO activity in Japan, which is extremely rare (discussed earlier)
Lower wage pressures than US/Europe, COVID supply chain pressures easing
Earnings expected to be flat vs contractions in the US and Europe
The lowest real
effective exchange rate in Japan in 50 years according to CEIC; the Yen has
also depreciated by 30% vs the Chinese RMB, which is relevant since Japan now
exports more to China than to the US1
Professor Elroy Dimson estimates that US equities outperformed non-US markets by ~2% per year from 1900 to 2021, which translates into very large cumulative excess returns. For most of this period, higher dividends explained the difference; since 1990, higher US valuations has been the dominant factor. Jack Bogle argues that excess US returns are not random and reflect US exceptionalism with respect to deeper markets and rule of law.
2
Our European P/E charts start in 2006. Before 2006, IFRS accounting standards required European companies to amortize goodwill, and the amounts involved were at times substantial. As a result, pre-2006 P/E multiples for Europe are not comparable to post-2006 multiples, and can distort time series comparisons vs the US.

Yellen says it would be a calamity not to raise the debt ceiling
. I wonder how she would describe the charts in our Jan 24 piece on inflation adjusted debt per capita since 1790, and on the collapse in discretionary spending due to rising entitlements. Those look like calamities too.Area chart shows the 3-year rolling barbell performance vs the MSCI All World Index for an overweight to US and EM and underweight to Europe and Japan from March 1991 to May 2023.

MR. MICHAEL CEMBALEST: Good morning, everybody, and welcome to the May 2023 Eye on the Market podcast. This one’s called Too Long at the Fair. I have recommended to clients for well over a decade, actually since 2009, that they should overweight the United States and emerging markets and underweight Europe and Japan in their regional equity allocations. The excess returns from that kind of strategy, if implemented, have been enormous. But the time has come to retire this barbell for a while. I stayed too long at the fair, and I should’ve made this recommendation to put the barbell aside a few months when Europe was trading at a massive 35% P/E discount to the US. And a slightly brighter picture in Japan relative to China is another reason why it’s time to put this barbell aside.
So this month’s Eye on the Market goes into the detail; we have some charts. The barbell has actually done extremely well since 1988. It’s been 30 years that investors have benefitted from overrating the United States and emerging markets versus Europe and Japan. Most of that benefit has come from overweighting the US over Europe. The EM versus Japan thing has been profitable, but smaller and kind of hit-or-miss over the last decade or so. And we have some charts in here that kind of illustrate that.
So first, why did this barbell perform so well since 2009 when we started to recommend it? We have a chart here that decomposes the reasons. And there’s five major factors. One is the outperformance of the dollar versus the euro. Another one is that US sector weights are higher in tech and healthcare and lower in financials, energy, industrials, and staples. And so there’s a sector benefit in the modern world to being overweight tech and healthcare. And then within sectors, US technology, consumer discretionary, and financial stocks have substantially outperformed their European counterparts. These five factors explain over 90% of the US outperformance since 2009.
Now what has changed over the last few months, since September of last year, Europe has outperformed the US by around 20%. Around two-thirds of that is simply due to the decline in the dollar. Now as we wrote last time, while we don’t think that the dollar’s reserve currency status is under serious threat, there is room on a cyclical basis for the dollar to decline, given its sharp rise versus other currencies. And there’s other bits and pieces in there, outperformance of European consumer discretionary stocks, a tiny bit of outperformance of European financials. But the vast majority of what’s happened over the last few months has been the change in the dollar.
And the other interesting thing is that since last fall, Japan has outperformed emerging markets by about 10%. And to me, what’s notable is that one of the factors there is a resurgence in M&A activity in Japan, which is unusual, and some of which is coming from foreign investors, which is even more unusual. And you have seen some of these deals, but Bain acquired Hitachi Metals, Evident, and Gelato Pique. KKR acquired Hitachi Transport; Fortress acquired Seven & I. All of these were multi-billion-dollar deals. A little bit more on Japan later, but the increase in leveraged buyout activity is kind of a big deal in Japan.
Now we’ve seen some arguments that suggest that while we’re in for another period like 2005 to 2007, where Europe crushed the US, that was kind of a weird period in Europe. There was an explosion of bank lending everywhere from Germany to Spain, Netherlands, Italy, France, and I don’t think that’s going to be repeating itself, so I think that’s kind of a silly argument. We have some charts in here that explain why.
The mistake that I made is that by not recommending this a few months ago, Europe is essentially a value play, when you look at the context of its heavy sector weightings to staples, financials, energy, and utilities. And everything has a price in the value market, right. And eventually price to earnings, price to book could get cheap enough that everything has a price. And I should have been paying more attention to how cheap Europe got. By September of last year, Europe’s P/E multiple hit the lowest level on record versus the US of around 35% P/E discount. And while there were valid concerns that all of us had about Europe’s energy situation, rising inflation, exposure to China, which was still in lockdown, investors were receiving an enormous discount for taking European equity exposure, and I should’ve been more focused on that.
Now how much can it rally? I think Europe’s outperformance is capped when you look at return on assets and return on equity. In almost every major sector, the US companies are more profitable than the European counterparts. But you’re getting paid a lot of money at a 30 to 35% P/E discount to take exposure to Europe.
And let me just spend a couple minutes on Japan. There’s been discussions about improved corporate governance in Japan for probably 20 years. But just over the last few years, it seems like the government is a little bit more serious in doing something about it. There’s been a record increase in stock buybacks. Sony’s spinoff and buyback is one example of that. And now the government is really going after the 50% of companies that trade below book value. They have to outline a plan to maximize shareholder value and comply with these new shareholder liquidity and director reforms. And the 10 to 20% of companies that don’t comply with the cross-holding and free-float rules may face delisting. So there’s a little bit more teeth now.
And around half of Japanese companies have a lot of cash compared to less than 20% in the US and Europe. So there’s a lot of potential benefits from a corporate governance move into Japan that has real momentum behind it. And of course, positioning is low in Japan. I don’t think I’ve ever talked about Japan on this podcast, or several years since I’ve talked about Japan in the Eye on the Market.
So to wrap up, the valuation discount for Europe and Japan remains pretty high. There might be a little bit more legs left in this anti-barbell trade. I wouldn’t argue for a reverse barbell, which would be overweight Europe and Japan. And I don’t have that much conviction in Europe to do that. Europe has a long history of grasping defeat from the jaws of victory, and the ECB still has tightening to do. But I also think the US debt ceiling is going to be raised one way or another.

Market update
Rolling, rolling, rolling on the river
We’ve already seen a lot in 2023. But through all of the challenges and angst, markets are, for the most part, holding their ground.
Today marks the 100th trading day of the year. With that in mind, today’s note considers what the beginning of the year has taught us, and what that might suggest for how it will finish.
So, we’re 100 days in and…
…the debt limit dilemma still isn’t resolved.
Things are getting down to the wire, with just seven days until Secretary Yellen’s estimated June 1 X-date. Given all that’s at stake, we continue to think a deal that raises or suspends the debt ceiling is
the most likely path
from here. Otherwise, a scenario that sees the government crash through the X-date but continue to make its debt payments (at the expense of more discretionary spending such as education or transportation) would feel a lot like a government shutdown, while the worst-case scenario of actual default (meaning the government never pays back its creditors) would be even more calamitous—neither have ever happened in the century that the debt ceiling has existed.
Democrats and Republicans have both noted progress in negotiations this week, but there still seems to be a wide divide on several key issues heading into the long Memorial Day weekend. Rating agencies are also now kicking up some dust, with Fitch putting the U.S.’s AAA credit rating on its downgrade watchlist yesterday—a move reminiscent of 2011’s episode.
Yet, the media noise may be louder than the risk markets hear. Outside of Treasuries and credit default swaps (which offer insurance against the risk of potential of default), broad markets haven’t been too roiled.
…bank worries are coming and going, but the Federal Reserve still seems divided.
It’s been almost a month since the last bank failure (and 11 weeks since all the bank drama kicked off). Questions over
further ripple effects
and
the future of the regional banking industry
remain, but much of the discourse around bank runs and a crisis of confidence seems to have moved on. A sign of the times: While the S&P 500 is having its worst week since March, the KBW Bank Index is in the green (on top of its best week since October last week).
Rather, the balancing act for central bankers seems to be between preparing for the effects of tightening credit conditions and tackling still elevated inflation. The latest Fed meeting minutes, which offer a peek behind the curtain of the May policy meeting, suggested policymakers may be done hiking rates. Yet, rhetoric from Fed speakers over the last week has signaled that even if a pause comes in June, a few more hikes may be needed to once and for all claim victory against inflation. The one consistent message has been pushing back on rate cuts—and it seems to be working: Markets have priced out almost all of the cuts they were baking in for this year—just ~25 basis points today versus ~80 basis points only three weeks ago.Either way, whether it takes a few more hikes or not, markets are still betting on the Fed getting things back in balance.
…Corporate America is doing just fine.
Q1 earnings season was far better than feared, even as it still showed a slowdown. Every sector but utilities bested profit expectations, and tech in particular blew it out of the water (look no further than NVIDIA’s stellar report this morning). Economists and Wall Street (us included) have been chattering about a potential recession for the last year, and that’s given Corporate America ample time to prepare, taking on cost cuts and refocusing to protect profits.
A recession still looks probable to us, but companies seem to be either less worried about it, or at least feel better prepared. While a few S&P 500 companies are still due to report in the coming days, those throwing out the “recession” buzzword have now declined for three straight quarters.…stocks are higher thanks to it.
It might be a tough week with all the debt ceiling drama, but the S&P 500 is holding onto a
+8%
year-to-date gain. While history is never a guarantee of future returns, that big of a gain at this point in the year tends to suggest there’s more green ahead. When the index has been +8% or more higher on Day 100 in the past (going back to 1950), the full year return has been positive in every instance, up on average +24%.…and it’s not just big tech, either.
To be sure, big tech has been a powerhouse. But the strength is broader than that. Consumer and travel names such as Royal Caribbean (+56%), Uber (+53%) and Booking (+30%) are some of the brightest spots. Semiconductors are up over +20%. Homebuilders are up some +16% so far this year. Seventeen countries are also outperforming the United States.To that end, Michael Cembalest, our Chairman of Market and Investment Strategy, has long called for barbelling an overweight to the United States and Emerging Markets, and an underweight to Europe and Japan. While that’s proved fruitful in the last decade or so, the tide’s turned this year. With Europe besting the United States by almost 3% year-to-date for dollar investors, and Japan hovering near three-decade highs, he’s
retiring the barbell, at least for now
.In all, while the slate of known unknowns seems full, the key when it comes to investing is balance—and multi-asset portfolios are designed to provide just that.

Jessica Matthews, Global Head of Sustainable Investing
Ian Schaeffer, Global Investment Strategist
Introduction
: Behind the U.S.’s largest commitment to industrial planning since the Cold War
Several decades ago, economists and policymakers made a strong case for globalization: If countries focused on making the things they’re relatively better at, global trade would become more efficient, spurring faster economic growth for everyone.
That theory became reality. But it had two grim consequences—if not quite unforeseen, then unexpectedly severe: U.S. labor participation fell off a cliff, and many blue-collar workers in American factories, particularly men, lost their jobs. Depression and death rates climbed, especially in the American Heartland.
Recently, another cost of what we think of as
hyper
-globalization has become clear. U.S. national security has been compromised, as companies have sent overseas strategically critical technology, including electronic and green energy components and military hardware. The deterioration of U.S. industrial capacity can hardly be overstated: Services now comprise nearly 80% of the national economy.
1
The federal government is responding. Despite political polarization in Washington, lawmakers passed three major initiatives intended to raise the country’s industrial capacity. Together, the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act (CHIPS) represent the largest U.S. commitment to industrial policy since the Cold War.
Federal industrial policy has sometimes failed. Yet the government’s heavy hand has at other times created profound and lasting changes, particularly when it established a new system with self-reinforcing demand. Previous successes have relied exclusively on public funding. Today’s grand national experiment will see if public funds can be used to stimulate private capital holders so that, together, they can create a self-perpetuating market.
We think the new industrial policy, which seeks to decarbonize the U.S. economy and strengthen American industry, has the potential to reverse some of the devastation, while creating exciting, long-term investment opportunities.Renewed U.S. industrial policy supports our view that in the current market cycle (and perhaps for several years after),
“real economy” stocks should outperform
the growth stocks that dominated the 2010s. We like real economy equities that tend to offer high free cash flow and dividend yields (and companies improving shareholder returns; for example, through dividend growth).
Among energy transition stocks, we favor manufacturers of clean energy technology over site developers and utilities, as we’ll explain. We also like investing in energy transition infrastructure, such as battery storage projects. Among corporate recipients of CHIPS Act benefits, we prefer semiconductor companies that have close ties to the U.S. military. Military spending, currently at a secular low relative to GDP, may rise in the years ahead.
Part 1: Grim consequences: The path to industrial policy today
Hyper-globalization’s impact on the American worker
Policymakers and economists understood from the start that globalization would lead to some job loss and economic hardship for certain communities. However, they thought economic gains would far outweigh losses and the bigger pie would compensate those affected, through worker retraining and other types of redistribution.
The overall efficiency of the global economy did improve—and the U.S. consumer benefited spectacularly. By one estimate, for every U.S. manufacturing job lost due to soaring trade with China in the 2000s, the U.S. consumer gained about USD100,000, or USD200 billion in total.
2
However, there were two practical problems with the way globalization unfolded. The first problem was that globalization did not happen gradually, and its effects were not absorbed smoothly. In the 1970s and 1980s, manufacturing job losses due to globalization (and automation) were steady. Even in the 1990s when globalization’s pace was accelerating, factory payrolls held up. But in the 2000s, after China joined the World Trade Organization, globalization accelerated rapidly. The camel’s back broke, and manufacturing payrolls fell off a cliff.
A total of 5.7 million factory jobs were lost from 2000 to 2010—nearly 10 times more than during the previous 30 years, from 1970 to 2000. Redistribution and worker retraining can be effective if change is slow and predictable, but in the event of a shock like this, there is only so much worker support systems can do.
3Workers, especially men, had a hard time adjusting to the shock of massive manufacturing job losses. Social, health and economic pathologies have bloomed as a consequence.
4
The share of working-age men not in the labor force rose from 5.7% at the start of the 1980s to 11.4% as of 2022. But the pain wasn’t smoothly distributed. It was concentrated in the Eastern Heartland, states east of the Mississippi River from Mississippi to Michigan (excluding the Atlantic Coast). That region’s mortality rates soared above the coasts’ and the Western Heartland’s.
5Had globalization not occurred as an abrupt shock but progressed more steadily and predictably, it is safe to say that less of these pathologies would have emerged.
How outsourcing opened national security vulnerabilities
Globalization’s impact on national security also didn’t exactly go according to plan. Its architects assumed that after the Soviet Union collapsed, the global economy would reap a “peace dividend” indefinitely. And so it largely did, in the decades after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.
But war, and the threat of it, eventually reemerged. Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, then invaded Ukraine in 2022. China in 2021 tested a hypersonic missile system capable of evading U.S. defenses.
6
Governments started to question globalization through a national security lens. More specifically, governments in the advanced economies began to realize GDPs based primarily on services are a vulnerability.
Emmanuel Todd, an influential French historian and sociologist, recently wrote, “Western power, measured on the basis of GDP, is fictitious.”
7
We think that is an overstatement, but helpfully provocative. While the U.S.’s GDP may outstrip China’s and Russia’s, it has a low non-services share of GDP and fewer military personnel.
The aforementioned U.S. social and health pathologies also create a national security vulnerability. A 2020 Pentagon study found that more than three-quarters of Americans aged 18–24 were medically unfit for military service. Obesity was the most widespread health problem.
8Part 2: How industrial policy can succeed
What is industrial policy? The case of the U.S. interstate highway system
Industrial policy can be defined as “an effort by a government to change the sectoral structure of production toward sectors it believes offer greater prospects for accelerated growth [or for national security reasons] than would be generated by a typical process of evolution according to comparative advantage.”
9
In other words, it is an intervention by the government to go against market forces.
Recent policy initiatives are intended to reduce the services share in GDP and raise the nation’s industrial capacity. Politically, there is now a bipartisan consensus that this is a necessity.
10
The history of U.S. industrial policy includes numerous examples of failure. The Synthetic Fuels Corporation, set up in 1980, failed spectacularly in reducing dependence on foreign sources of oil. But done right, industrial policy can create profound change that reinforces itself over time.
The largest and one of the most successful examples in U.S. history is the Federal-Aid Highway Act, passed in 1956 to build the interstate highway system. It was designed to connect cities and towns, lift productivity and, as today, improve national security. Mindful of the Cold War, the network of highways would allow military resources to be rapidly mobilized.
The government played a huge upfront role. By the early 1960s, U.S. public spending on highways totaled 1.8% of GDP. But as more drivers took to the road in the late 1960s and 1970s, the Highway Trust Fund, set up to maintain the roads, grew. The fund derives its revenue from gasoline and diesel fuel sales taxes. Over time, its balance started to rise. By the 1980s, public spending on highways fell to around 1% of GDP, financed entirely by the system’s own revenues from the public.
The fund’s surplus eventually eroded after the 2008 financial crisis. People were driving less (fewer tolls collected) and cars’ fuel efficiency improved (generating less in gas taxes). Highway maintenance costs kept rising. Since 2008, the Treasury Department has plugged the fund’s shortfalls with fiscal transfers.Whatever its later financial troubles, the government, playing a heavy hand upfront, set off a system that became self-financing with its own internal source of demand. And still today, the interstate highway system is profoundly important to U.S. transportation infrastructure: While accounting for only 1% of all road mileage, it accounts for 24% of all vehicle miles driven in rural America.
11
The U.S. government is attempting to do something similar today when it comes to decarbonizing the economy, but rather than relying entirely on public financing, it aims to provide a set of carrots that stimulate private sector investment.
The Inflation Reduction Act
:
Carrots for Players in the Energy Transition
The Inflation Reduction Act is a misnomer: IRA is an energy bill. It, and CHIPS, are designed to use public funds to stimulate private capital investment, using subsidies and tax credits. These enticements to private-sector partners taper off, and then fully phase out once renewables are cost-competitive without government support, and emissions targets (reducing electricity sector emissions by 75% by 2032
12
) are met.
IRA tax credits and subsidies are designed to push down the cost of renewable energy production and, in turn, a competitive power market should push down consumer energy prices over time, spurring a faster adoption of renewables.
13
Economies of scale and technology learning curves have already resulted in sharp declines in the cost of wind and solar power. By 2030, Bloomberg New Energy Finance (NEF) projects that the cost of generating wind and solar power will be well below average wholesale power prices as a result of the IRA investment/production tax credits, which are expected to drive net costs (for solar) to just 15USD to 25USD per MWh (chart below).
14
If that’s the case, then there should be substantial continued investment in wind and solar generation, constrained only by the speed with which additions can be integrated into the grid.
15
The increased expected cost competitiveness of renewables resulting from the IRA already appears to be accelerating private-sector capital spending commitments. In the subsequent eight months since legislators signed the bill into law in August 2022, companies announced more than USD150 billion in private capital investment for U.S. utility-scale clean energy projects and manufacturing facilities—surpassing total investment in these projects commissioned from 2017–2021.
16How can industrial policy potentially impact investors? Changing profitability expectations
We think the energy transition that the IRA seeks to catalyze is likely to play out more visibly at the company level, as its incentives take hold and change profitability expectations.
The IRA offers manufacturers tax credits.
17
That’s in part why the largest profit margin increases are likely to accrue to manufacturers. Single-stock analysts at J.P. Morgan Research are starting to incorporate these tax credits into their modeling of financial statements. Their initial conclusion: Expect big effects. They expect that by 2025, the IRA can double the profit margin for a representative renewables technology manufacturer versus the no-IRA baseline.
18Higher expected profitability is likely to drive up capex as firms begin to see more clearly their likely returns from newly expanded production. The end result: expanded renewables generation capacity relative to the pre-IRA baseline. Bloomberg NEF estimates that by 2030, there will be about 88,000 MW of additional utility-scale solar and wind capacity as a result of the IRA. That’s roughly the capacity of the Texas electrical grid in 2020.
19
Project developers, however, may not experience spectacular profit gains. The IRA’s incentives for developers seek to remedy the
geographic
inequalities that grew during hyper-globalization. Under the IRA, project developers are entitled to multiple “stackable” investment tax credits, if their energy production is sited in a low-income area and/or an “energy community”
20
—that is, in the Eastern Heartland areas where shuttered coal and brownfield sites stand to benefit.
Another reason manufacturers’ profit margins are likely to increase more than developers’ is that under the IRA, even some of the developer credits will likely accrue more to manufacturers because of the market structure for critical components. For developers to receive the “domestic content” credit, for example, they need to purchase components from U.S. manufacturers of renewables technology, and there are relatively few of them today. Being highly sought after can give these manufacturers a new premium in pricing power that they may pass on to their customers, likely eroding the tax credit for developers—at least until domestic manufacturing capacity expands.
21
The potential macroeconomic effects of renewed U.S. industrial policy
We do not expect large effects on trend GDP growth over the next decade. These laws’ economic multipliers are expected to be mostly low. The IRA’s intent is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and to the extent this is achieved, it will be a non-GDP benefit for U.S. residents and the global population.
Nor is the CHIPS Act meant to raise GDP. The United States is a high-cost destination for semiconductor chip production. (An executive from Taiwanese chip maker TSMC has said in an earnings call that production in the United States costs four times more than in Taiwan.
22
) It is highly inefficient to reshore the industry, especially considering semiconductor chips are among the most easily transportable goods in the global supply chain. Yet CHIPS may increase domestic semiconductor-chip security, serving as a hedge against any future supply disruptions—a benefit, but not to GDP.
For these reasons, we wouldn’t be surprised if the economic multipliers from the IRA and the CHIPS Act were close to zero. To be sure, these bills may shift the composition of investment demand, away from housing toward manufacturing (which could be problematic, given the
chronic U.S. housing shortage
).
On the other hand, the third new law, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, is expected to boost GDP through traditional productivity effects. But the addition is too small to meaningfully accelerate trend growth.
23
New laws are expected to have little effect on long-run inflation expectations, but may spur more short-run variability
These three new laws aren’t likely to change long-run expected inflation, which is anchored by monetary policy and the effect it has on the labor market (as the fastest pace of rate hikes in 40 years has reminded us). The laws may well change short-run inflation
variability,
however, by increasing resource nationalism globally; barriers may create unexpected pressure on commodity prices in the years ahead.
To see what that looks like, consider the inflation shock the pandemic brought about. Remarkably, it didn’t alter long-term inflation expectations, yet it created tremendous short-run variability (chart below). The energy transition may cause similar inflation dynamics in the future, although likely not as dramatic (COVID hit suddenly, while the energy transition will spread over years and decades).
24
Nevertheless, a more variable inflation outlook may mean the Treasury market’s current pricing of inflation risk premia is too low.
25Conclusion: Investment implications
Renewed industrial policy supports our expectation that the current market cycle is likely to be a “real economy” cycle, after the “growth cycle” of a decade ago. Within this real economy thesis, we like equities that can potentially offer high free cash flow and dividend yields, including those companies shifting their focus toward shareholder returns (e.g., dividend and buyback growth). When it comes to the energy transition specifically, we favor the manufacturers of clean energy technology over both the developers and the utilities. (Many of the IRA’s subsidies for developers will likely accrue more to domestic manufacturers.)
When it comes to energy-transition commodities, we note that China currently dominates the supply chains for many critical minerals related to renewables, leading the world in production of aluminum refining and smelting (67% of global capacity), lithium and cobalt refining (80% and 66%, respectively) and graphite production and refining (about 80%)—along with many other critical minerals.
26
We also note that while the IRA offers U.S. consumers a tax credit for buying an electric vehicle, half the credit disappears if vehicles do not meet the requirements for critical minerals to be extracted, processed and/or recycled in North America, or in a country with which the United States has a free trade agreement.
27
In light of this, exposure to commodities necessary for the transition to renewables may offer attractive investment returns less correlated to a typical portfolio of stocks and bonds. Another favorable way of gaining exposure to the energy transition outside of stocks and bonds would be direct exposure to energy-transition infrastructure projects. Two attractive examples are battery storage and recycling.
When it comes to the CHIPS Act’s implications, we prefer U.S.-domiciled foundries and integrated device makers (IDMs) that have close ties to the U.S. military—in other words, investments in technologies that have so-called “dual use” capabilities. Military spending is currently secularly low relative to GDP, and we think there is a good chance it may rise in the years ahead, given how the Ukraine War is rapidly depleting NATO stockpiles,
28
and the rising U.S.-China military tensions in the South China Sea.In sum, while the new industrial policy was designed to decarbonize the U.S. economy and reindustrialize the American Heartland after the devastation wrought by hyper-globalization, it also includes important incentives to stimulate private investment. We think it will usher in many interesting long-term investment opportunities.

Measured for 2000–2007. The effect comes from lower prices (relative to the counterfactual) from greater trade with China. The price effect was found to be about two percentage points, so multiplying by nominal GDP of $10.3 trillion in 2000 yields a gain to U.S. consumers of about USD200 billion, or USD100,000 per manufacturing job lost due to offshoring the two million total jobs lost.

The logic is that market-determined prices today should be based on current technologies, which are largely non-renewables, so effectively the chart is illustrating the cost-competitiveness increase for renewables relative to non-renewables as a result of the IRA.

There are serious pitfalls when considering the so-called “levelized cost of energy” from renewables as the basis of comparison against non-renewable power sources. As Michael Cembalest, Chairman of Market and Investment Strategy at J.P. Morgan Asset & Wealth Management, has noted, the problem with LCOEs is that they don’t account for (a) the need for backup power and storage for when renewables are not generating, (b) how the value of electricity supplied changes throughout the day, and (c) the cost of overbuilding renewable capacity to meet demand in a deeply decarbonized system.

, J.P. Morgan, March 28, 2023. For these reasons, the emissions reductions policymakers are assuming will be met as a result of the IRA may be too aggressive.

The relevant credits are 45C and 45X; 45C is tax credit for companies to take against the cost of building factories to manufacture components for renewable energy projects; 45X is a tax credit for each renewables component manufactured. The two cannot be “stacked,” meaning the 45X credit is not available for components made at a factory that already benefited from the 45C credit. “Federal Tax Credits for Solar Manufacturers,” U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy, October 2022.

The mechanics of how IRA tax credits boost profitability for manufacturers is, most typically, via the direct pay option: Many or most manufacturers don’t have large tax liabilities to offset, so they opt for direct cash payments from the government (paid as part of the year-end tax filing process), which lowers their COGS (cost of goods sold) and thereby raises their margins. Most manufacturers seem to be opting for 45X (rather than 45C), which is an implicit bet that factory utilization and output will be high, translating into higher credit payments compared to 45C, which is based on the overall upfront investment of a new manufacturing site.

Energy communities are areas where a coal-fired power plant has closed since 2010, or a coal mine has closed since 2000; or a metropolitan or non-metropolitan statistical area where 0.17% or more of direct employment, or at least 25% of local tax revenues, are related to extraction, processing, transport or storage of coal, oil or natural gas, and where unemployment is at or above the national average in the previous year.

Some general information on those developer tax credits: Before the IRA, renewable energy production site developers for solar could receive a 26% federal tax credit. Now, the IRA’s full “stack” of credits could be as high as 70%. A developer could receive one 30% tax credit for facilities meeting certain labor standards, which rises to 40% for investments in facilities using U.S.-made “domestic content,” and which rises further to 50% if the facility is in an “energy” community, and finally to 60%–70% if the project site is located in a low-income area and/or meets low-income housing qualifications. The domestic content qualifications are satisfied if (1) 100% of the steel or iron used in a qualifying project is produced in the United States; and (2) 40% of the manufactured products used in constructing the project are produced in the United States. For the definition of a low-income community, see “Initial Guidance Establishing Program to Allocate Environmental Justice Solar and Wind Capacity Limitation Under Section 48(e),” Internal Revenue Service, February 13, 2023.

It would be an altogether different story, though, if the Federal Reserve were to change its inflation target, as some think tanks are advocating. We are not expecting this, at least not in the near term, but it is something to continually monitor.

“NATO chief says Ukraine’s ammunition use outstripping supply,” Associated Press, February 13, 2023.The chart describes total spending resulting from federal policy initiatives as % of GDP. The bar on the left describes the total spending from the Manhattan Project, which was at 0.4% of GDP. The bar in the middle describes the total spending from the Federal-Aid Highway Act, which was at 1.8% of GDP. The bar on the right describes the total spending from the Industrial Policy Bills of 2012-2022, which was 0.7% of GDP in total. It was also divided in private spending (0.4% GDP) and public spending (0.3% GDP).The chart describes the three recent policy bills and their funding which added up to almost $2.4 trillion. The chart is a breakdown of how this $2.4 trillion funding is distributed among the three bills and specifies the size allocated to public spending and private capital. The bar on the right is the funding for Inflation Reduction Act, which is a total of $1660 billion divided in $781 billion for public spending and $879 billion for private capital. The bar in the middle is the funding for CHIPs and Science Act of 2022, which is a total of $167 billion divided in $52 billion for public spending and $115 billion for private capital. The bar on the right is the funding for Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, which is a total of $550 billion. The entire amount is public spending in this case.The chart describes the decline of the number of manufacturing jobs in the US as global trade for goods to industrial production rose. The manufacturing jobs line started at 17847 in 1970 and fluctuated near that level until it reached 17265 in 2000. Then it declined rapidly and dramatically to bottom at 11529 in 2010 before slightly trending up until the last data point at 12827 in 2022. The global trade for goods to industrial production line started at 53.7% in 1991 for the first data point. Then it went steadily up until it reached a high point at 99.6% in 2008 before heading down to 95.3% in 2009. Then it trended slightly upward until the last data point came in at 104.5% in 2022.This chart shows the percent change in U.S. manufacturing jobs (10-year percent change) and the opioid prescriptions per capita in morphine milligram equivalents. The data range is form 1960 through 2021. US manufacturing jobs remained relatively rangebound between 10 to -20% from 1960 until 2000. Starting around 2000, US manufacturing job losses declined rapidly and reached a low point in 2009 of -41%. US manufacturing then began climbing until 2020 when it breached above zero for the first time in decades to reach 1%. The Opioid prescriptions per capita dataset begins in 2001 at 189 morphine milligram equivalents. The number of opioid prescriptions per capita then steadily climbed until 2021 to peak at 801. From there, the opioid prescriptions per capita slowly declined until 2001 to reach 445.This chart shows the mortality rates (ratio of deaths per 100 people) in three different geographic areas of the United States from 1970 through 2015. The three regions shown include the eastern heartland, western heartland, and coasts. The eastern heartland includes Michigan, Ohio, West Virginia, Indiana, Kentucky, Illinois, Missouri, Tennessee, Arkansas, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana. The western heartland includes Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona, Kansas, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, Nebraska, Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota. The coastal states include Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Washington, Oregon, and California. All three regions have roughly similar mortality rates from 1970 until 1995. Mortality rates gradually declined from a level of 0.5 in 1970 to 0.3 in 1995. At that point, the mortality rat of the western heartland and the costs began declining and reached 0.25 by the decade of 2010. The eastern heartland mortality rate did not experience the same decline. The eastern heartland’s mortality rate remained elevated at around 0.35 from 1995 through 2014.There are two charts shown here. The chart on the left describes the Gross Domestic Product of United States vs China vs Russia. For United States, the left side bar shows that the Gross Domestic Product is at 26185. For China, the middle bar shows that the Gross Domestic Product is at 19244. For Russia, the right side bar shows that the Gross Domestic Product is at 2136. The chart on the right is broken up into two sections. The left section describes the non-services percentage share of GDP for US vs China vs Russia. For United States, the left side bar shows that the non-services percentage share of GDP is 18.3%. For China, the middle bar shows that the non-services percentage share of GDP is 45.5%. For Russia, the right side bar shows that the non-services percentage share of GDP is 44%. The right section describes the total military personnel for US vs China vs Russia (million). For United States, the left side bar shows that the total military personnel is at 2.1 million. For China, the middle bar shows that the total military personnel is at 4.0 million. For Russia, the right side bar shows that the total military personnel is at 3.7 million.The chart describes the surplus or deficit of the U.S. Highway Trust Fund as a percentage share of GDP. A diverging line starts to emerge in 2008 where fiscal transfers were made from the Treasury Department to plug the fund’s shortfalls. For the line before 2008, the first data point came in at 0.11% in 1957. Then it rose to a high point at 0.57% in 1975. Before falling to 0.11% in 2007. Then the line diverges into two lines, one including fiscal transfers and one excluding fiscal transfers. For the line including transfers: The data came in at 0.11% in 2008 and peaked at 0.37% in 2016. Then it ended lower at 0.22% in 2018. For the line excluding transfers: The data came in at 0.06% in 2008. Then it went all the way down and entered negative territory. It ended and bottomed at -0.48% in 2018.This chart shows levelized cost of energy (LCOE) estimates for solar and wind energy from 2021 and 2023 for five regions of the US electricity grid (representing 54% of the national market). The regions shown are New York, California, Texas, PJM, and MISO. The data for 2021 represents pre-IRA data and is shown in $/MWh (Real 2020). The data for 2023 represents post-IRA data and is shown in $/MWh (Real 2022). MWh stands for megawatt hour. The 2030 forward power price (inflation adjusted) is shown for each of the 5 regions to shown the current market estimate for the price of power in the year 2030. The pre-IRA data for solar and wind energy is significantly higher for each of the 5 regions than the post-IRA data due to the subsidies and tax credits associated with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. In most cases, the pre-IRA LCOEs are higher than the 2030 forward power price and the post-IRA LCOEs are significantly lower than the 2030 forward power price.The chart describes the GAAP gross profit margin for a renewable tech maker from 2018 through 2025 as an index where 2018=100. It also describes the difference between the gross profit margins for that renewable tech maker with and without IRA tax credits in the years after 2022. The line begins in 2018 at 100 and remains relatively flat in 2019. It rises slightly in 2020 and 2021 before falling sharply in 2022 to a low. At this point, the line showing no IRA tax credits diverges from the line showing IRA tax credits. The line including IRA tax credit rises significantly in every year after 2022 to reach 201 in 2023, 260 in 2024, and 292 in 2025. The line without the IRA tax credits also rises from 2022, but not as significantly as the line with IRA tax credits. The line without IRA tax credits reaches 89 in 2023, 134 in 2024, and 148 in 2025.The chart describes the 1 year and 7-10 year inflation expectations for headline CPI yoy. For 1 year ahead CPI consensus, the line started at 3.5% in January 1995. It went down until it reached 1.8% in March 2004. Then it went up to 2.7% in June 2008. Before it fell all the way to 1.2% in December 2008. Then it recovered and went up until it peaked at 3.5% in March 2022. Before falling to the most recent data point at 2.6% in April 2023. For 7-10 year ahead CPI consensus, the line started at 3.4% in January 1995. Then it trended downward and reached the most recent data point at 2.1% in April 2023.The chart describes the US defense spending as a % of GDP in a line format. The first data point came in at 1.57% in 1901. It stayed flat until it came in at 0.96% in 1916. Then it rose and peaked at 22.52% in 1919. Before falling back to 1.79% in 1922. It stayed relatively flat until it reached 2.25% in 1940. Then it reached a record high point at 41.52% in 1945. Before falling to 7.79% in 1948. Then it climbed to a high point at 17.39% in 1953. Then it trended downward until the last data point at 4.37% in 2022.Contact us to discuss how we can help you experience the full possibility of your wealth.

: on the US dollar, reserve currencies and the South China Morning Post
A recent article in the South China Morning Post was entitled “
End of dollar dominance will also spell demise of US hegemony
”.  Oh, the places we could go with that one!  I will resist temptation and focus more narrowly on the question of the dollar as the world’s reserve currency.  We take a look at trade, foreign exchange, reserve investment, sloppy economics, gold, the impact of sanctions, money supply, the seeds of de-dollarization and the chart that everyone hates.  To begin, some brief comments on the US business cycle and the chicken pox party in US regional banks.[START RECORDING]

MR. MICHAEL CEMBALEST: Good morning and welcome to the late April Eye on the Market podcast. Before getting into this week’s discussion on the dollar, two quick things. US economic data is really strong right now in Q1/Q2, but all the long data leading indicators we look at that look out six, nine, 12 months suggest that there is a material slowdown coming ahead. I don’t think it’s anything catastrophic. We still think the stock market lows of last year hold. I don’t think if there’s a recession, it’s anything more than a mild one, but a lot of indicators we’re looking at are all pointing in the same direction. So we have a table on those; you can take a look.
And then there’s a quick comment on the fact that after 16 years of misleading levelized cost of energy statistics that Lazard has been publishing, they now have finally realized what me and other people have been writing about for years, which is that levelized cost of energy is flawed since it doesn’t include the cost of backup thermal power or energy storage. They are now incorporating some of those costs. And of course their revised wind and solar cost estimates are much higher than natural gas for that reason. Anyway, brief comment on that.
So the main topic for this week is an article that caught my eye out of the South China Morning Post called, let’s see, “End of Dollar Dominance Will Also Spell the Demise of US Hegemony.” Wow, the places we could go on that one, right. I mean, I could write a piece that looks at the press freedom that the South China Morning Post enjoys or does not enjoy and compare press freedom measures by country. I could look at the issues related to the ownership of that particular publication. We could look at Chinese currency intervention after joining the WTO and its impact on US manufacturing wages. We could look at mercantilism, we could look at issues around rule of law, judicial independence, property rights, capital controls. Now is probably a bad time to do all that. And since I’ve written on some of those topics before, this Eye on the Market only addresses the issue of the dollar as the world’s reserve currency since a lot of clients ask about it.
I think it’s important to look at the big picture and to look at the numbers so that we’re not overly influenced by individual anecdotes about countries adopting the renminbi or something other currency for trading and settlement purposes. So de-dollarization, here’s the bottom line. Dedollarization is a very hot topic, but there’s a lot more smoke than fire so far.
As a reminder, being the world’s reserve currency is a really big deal. And the easiest way to think about that is that the US shares of trade in the world is just around 10 or 12%. The US is only around 20 or 25% of global GDP, yet the dollar has a much higher share of foreign exchange, trade, debt issuance, and foreign exchange reserve investment by foreign central banks. So that’s why it’s important to be the world’s reserve currency.
Around 35% of all Treasury bonds are owned by foreign official and private sector investors, and if that figure ever dropped to 20%, which is the average foreign ownership share of European countries, there would be an extra $3.5 trillion in Treasury supply that somebody would have to buy, and obviously that could be very painful for US Treasury yields.
So when and if the dollar loses, or were to lose its reserve currency status is a big deal. So we have a piece this week that walks through the issues. I’m just going to summarize them here because there’s a lot of information here, mostly with charts and things that make it pretty clear. There’s no evidence that the dollar’s role in foreign exchange is changing over the last 20 years, and the dollar accounted last year for 89% of all foreign exchange transactions. In other words, the dollar was on one side or the other in 89% of all foreign exchange transactions. It also dominates the currency forward in swap markets. The renminbi has grown a little bit, but is still very, very, very small, and then we get into the issue of foreign exchange reserves.
So the dollar is still the primary choice for investment to foreign exchange reserves, at about 60%. That share has declined by a few percent over the last few years, but as Barry Eichengreen, who is one of my favorite experts on these topics at Berkeley describes, most of that 6% shift is explained by increased allocations into smaller economies like Australia, Canada, Sweden, and the Korean won.
And so only a small bit of the recent shift is explained by increased allocations to the renminbi, most of which is driven by Russia. And if anything, given the massive size of China’s bond market, it’s the third-largest in the world and bigger than Germany, France, and Spain combined, and the fact that the IMF added China to its special drawing rights basket a few years ago, the real question to ask is why is their renminbi so small still rather than the fact that it’s being held in foreign exchange reserves at all, right? The right question is why is it still so small?
There was an article in the FT recently that talked about the 8% decline in dollar reserves in absolute terms over the last couple of years. And the author cited this is evidence of the dollar’s weakening status. This was pretty flawed and sloppy economics, because the absolute decline in dollar reserves is almost entirely a reflection of rising bond yields and falling bond prices. So you can pretty much ignore that, and we explain that.
We have a section in here on what happened during COVID. There was a brief period of central bank selling of Treasuries, but they have since rebounded. We have a section in here on when the dollar overtook the British pound. Yes, the Chinese economy is now larger than the size of the US economy, but when the US overtook the British pound, the size of the US was somewhere between three-and-a-half and five times the size of the UK. So the mere fact that China’s economy is the same size as the US doesn’t really tell you that much. Reserve currency status depends upon a lot of things more than size.
One of the major arguments that gets made sometimes is the impact of Western sanctions on Russia is going to really change the desire to hold dollar reserves. I think this is a bit premature, and the risk to the dollar from these sanctions may be exaggerated. When you look at the, historically there’s a link between a country’s geopolitical ties and how they invest their FX reserves, for all the obvious reasons. And today about 50 to 60% of US government Treasuries and agencies are held by foreign governments that have strong ties with the US. And then that figure rises to 75% when you include countries that have military cooperation with the US.
So a lot of the dollar holders, other than China and Hong Kong, have either explicit or implicit military cooperation agreements with the US, and I think despite all the whining sometimes that you hear, I think the dollar departures are going to be a lot slower than sometimes advertised. And even as it relates to Hong Kong’s peg, as it relates to Hong Kong, the currency peg requires that they have at least 80% of their liquid assets in dollars, and currently that figure is around 90%. And then similarly, Saudi Arabia and the UAE also pegged their currencies to the dollar.
So it’s really when we’re talking about the risks to dollar holdings, it’s primarily an issue on China. Chinese bankers told Chinese officials in April of last year that diversifying into yen and euros was not very practical given the massive size of China’s reserves. And while China dollar holdings have been declining, the share of dollars in China’s reserves has been roughly unchanged at 60% for at least the last ten to 15 years. So I think sometimes the sanctions issue may be over-exaggerated as a risk to the dollar.
Instead of investing in other fiat currencies, certainly other central banks could sell dollars to buy gold, and that has been happening over the last few years. Gold holdings fell a lot from the early 90s to, let’s say 2007, ‘cause gold prices weren’t doing anything. And then once gold prices started going up, central banks started adding gold again. But outside of Russia and Turkey, the gold shares tend to be somewhere between 5 and 10%, sometimes a little bit lower. And I get the sense that 10%, maybe 12% is about as high as a lot of central banks want to go in terms of their gold holdings. And sometimes there’s a lot of discussions about sanctions driving people to own gold, but some of the more interesting studies we’ve read recently show that the drivers of gold allocations are primarily your monetary and fiscal policy rather than sanctions-related issues.
To me, one of the really interesting questions here on China is what would it take to see greater diversification by central banks and private sector entities into the renminbi. And we have a page here that looks at this. China has a massively high money supply, the highest in the world, when compared to their own GDP. If they fully opened their capital account and let residents take their money out freely in terms of a fully convertible currency, that could create incentives for other entities around the world and central banks to buy and sell debt denominated in renminbi, and that would create the depth in liquidity like you have with the dollar and the euro markets. The problem is China appears to not really want to have a fully convertible capital account, because we have no idea how much renminbi could leave and cause a collapse in Chinese equity and real estate markets.
So a colleague of mine in Singapore, Alex Wolf, did some really interesting analysis. We have some charts in here that show just how different China looks relative to freely floating currencies and also to pegged currencies in terms of how their money supply is massively out of whack relative to the amount of central bank assets and FX reserves. You have to see the charts; I don’t think I could do justice to it explaining it. But when you see the charts, you realize that China is a really different entity in terms of the massive disconnect between money supply, reserves, and central bank assets. And the only way you can sustain that is having a continuously closed capital account. And if that’s the case, I’m not so sure how much diversification into renminbi that you’re going to see.
So yeah, we’re going to watch all of these little dedollarization themes, right. The Saudis and the Chinese oil flows that may, some of which may be denominated in renminbi, Indian purchases of Russian oil, some of which are denominated in UAE dirhams, gas flows from Russia to China, which are being negotiated maybe in euros or renminbi, Chinese purchases of iron ore from Brazil, right. But the amounts matter, and it’s not clear yet that all of these negotiations are going to be really material in the bigger picture.
So yes, there are seeds of de-dollarization happening, but this is a really good example of something where you want to see the numbers and measure their magnitude before you make any judgments about reserve currency status. All of that said, the dollar’s reserve currency status may not be under siege, but that doesn’t mean the dollar can’t fall from here, because it just recently it was at its highest level in 30 years. And so there’s a lot of economic outcomes that could drive the dollar lower, but just don’t confuse the macroeconomic cycle issues with reserve currency issues. So last comment, and again reading the piece is a little bit easier, this is a macroeconomic topic that lends itself to kind of charts rather than words, I’m not ignoring the longterm fiscal issues that the US faces. I’ve written about them a lot. And you remember that chart that I call the chart that everybody hates, we repeat it in this chart, it’s the one that shows how non-defense discretionary spending is being crowded out by entitlements. There used to be a oneto-one in terms of the split between the two. And by the end of the decade we’ll be spending, the US will be spending $4 on entitlements for $1 spent on everything else, and that’s got some negative productivity issues and will also drive up debt-to-GDP ratios.
But I figure that the US has about 20 years to figure things out before there’s a more sustained reserve currency threat from the renminbi, because China has a lot debt issues of its own. If you actually look at the sum of corporate and government debt in China, it’s around the same level as it is in the United States. And in China, some of the corporate sector is increasingly indistinguishable from the government itself. If over the next 20 years, the United States veers off into Greece, Japan territory with respect to the federal debt and doesn’t do anything about entitlements, then at that point I think the long predicted decline of the dollar as the reserve currency might finally happen. But a lot of the comments that we’re reading right now seem premature, and this week’s piece is one way of looking at that. So thanks for listening, and see you next time.

Cross Asset Strategy
The November FOMC meeting dominated the market narrative this week. The Fed delivered a 75bps hike as expected, but there were a number of key takeaways from the FOMC statement and Chair Powell’s press conference that could frame the market narrative for the coming quarters. The FOMC statement acknowledged that they will “take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy” and “the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation"". This is a key development from earlier communications and a sign that policymakers are acknowledging the amount of tightening that has already occurred. This suggests that a different phase in the tightening cycle might be upon us and the pace of hikes could slow starting from the next meeting in December. Markets rallied on the news.
However, Chair Powell’s press conference leaned more hawkish. He mentioned that “incoming data since our last meeting suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates will be higher than previously expected”. The median Fed projection from the September meeting sees a terminal Fed Funds rate of 4.6% in 2023. Markets are now pricing 5.1% by May 2023 and barely a cut by the end of the year. Chair Powell appears quite resolute in maintaining the Fed’s credibility in bringing inflation down to their target, commenting that it is “premature” to talk about pausing rate hikes. By the end of the day, it was decidedly risk off for markets. The S&P 500 was down 2.5%, and the NASDAQ down over 3%. Large cap tech names underperformed while more defensive and cyclical sectors outperformed. Bond yields rose, but not by much. The 2-year was up by 4 bps, the 10-year rose 3.5bps, and the yield curve remains inverted.
The Fed will likely raise rates at a slower pace when they meet in December and early next year, but it seems like the terminal rate might end up being higher than the 4.5-4.75% that we currently have penciled in. The economy and markets will have to deal with the higher rates and their consequences well into 2023. There is potential good news and bad news here for markets. The bad news is that the higher rates go, the higher the chances that we get a recession. The good news is that a slower pace could work to reduce volatility across markets and provide an opportunity to actually pivot if growth and inflation slow down faster than the Fed expects. In this note we take stock of just how much financial conditions have tightened in this hiking cycle, look at a history of economic downturns and how indicators perform during those times, and consider when the upcoming downturn – and the Fed pivot – can begin.
Strategy question: What do the latest Fed signals tell us?
How much tightening has been done?We are experiencing a historic tightening in financial conditions; it just hasn’t shown up in the economy yet. Since 1982, the U.S. economy has not seen aggregate financial conditions tighten this much without a recession.Tighter financial conditions take time to filter through the economy. Interest rate sensitive sectors – like housing – tend to feel the impact first. From there, manufacturing employment and activity follow, as corporations are forced to defend margins. Layoffs and finally inflation – the lagging economic variable – are last to be impacted.
To capture the high inflation regime of the 70s and 80s, we can consider the three month – 10 year yield curve as a proxy for financial conditions through history. Inversion in this part of the yield curve is an academically-proven proxy for “tight” conditions (time “0” on the y-axis is curve inversion). Over the last 60 years, the yield curve has inverted in six distinct episodes. On average, housing strength peaked six to nine months before yield curve inversion (first column). From there, goods producing employment started declining six months after inversion (second column). On average, inflation peaked 18 months after inversion (last column).While we have to respect the lags, history is just a guide and the magnitude of this tightening in financial conditions suggests the lag may be shorter this cycle. The yield curve only just inverted in late October, but housing starts are already down 25% from their peak. Historically, such pain is felt around 12 months after inversion.
Our base case is that the U.S. will experience a recession starting in the middle of 2023 – and we expect layoffs to happen at that time. We continue to view a financial crisis recession as unlikely, as Dodd Frank regulations have solidified bank balance sheets and pushed riskier lending outside the banking sector.
When can the Fed pivot?
Around mid-2022, the FOMC appeared to change its “reaction function”; instead of adjusting policy to expected future growth and inflation outcomes, realized outcomes have driven their adjustments. The change reflects that inflation has wildly overshot their mandate and expectations, and that the risk of entrenched inflation has gone up. The consequence of the change in the reaction function is recession risk. If the FOMC waits for realized inflation to roll over (the lagging economic variable), they risk over-tightening and financial instability. The Fed has acknowledged the tightening that they have already conducted and the lagged effects of that tightening in the November FOMC meeting.
We expect around 50bps and 25bps hikes at the December and February 2023 meetings, respectively. We have two primary reasons for the slower expected pace of rate hikes:
We expect growth and inflation to cool meaningfully in the coming quarters. As detailed above, we view the year-to-date tightening in financial conditions as sufficient to cause a recession; so it is just a matter of time before economic variables cause them to adjust course.
Financial stability has started to come into question. With so much uncertainty, Treasury market makers have substantially reduced liquidity. Relative to Bloomberg’s fair value curve, Treasury bonds are on average trading at the widest level since the COVID-induced liquidity crisis. Without a functioning Treasury market, the Fed will not be able to transmit monetary policy. By providing some clarity on the trajectory of policy rates, the Fed can add stability.Lessons from the U.S. rates overshoot
Since 2018, our rates framework has expected 10 year Treasury yields to trade between 0.75% and 3%, 95% of the time. Over that five year time frame, the 10-year has been outside of the range 21% of the time, ~130 days above 3% and ~135 days below 75bps.
1
Over the last two months, the overshoot has been sharp, with 10 year Treasury yields touching 4.35% in October. We attribute the overshoot to two primary drivers:
The magnitude and persistence of the inflation overshoot has prompted one of the fastest rate hiking cycles since the 1980s. The current 5.1% terminal rate priced into markets is well in excess of the 2.5% long-run neutral estimate by the FOMC.
There is uncertainty if the expected rate hikes will be enough to keep inflation expectations anchored. Policy uncertainty in the short term is eroding confidence in where policy rates will be in the long run. This uncertainty can be seen in market pricing for long-dated policy rate expectations. The average cash rate five to ten years in the future rose to 3.8% at its high point in October, again well in excess of the 2.5% long run neutral estimated by the FOMC (see chart below).An overshoot represents more value for wealth aggregators and core fixed income continues to be one of our highest conviction calls. The ratio between HY and investment grade (IG) yields is near the tightest it’s been over the last five years, suggesting relative value favors IG over HY. With yields at these levels, the power of carry is in core fixed income’s favor. IG yields of >6% are enough to offset a further 90bps increase in IG yields over a year’s time, up from just 33bps at the start of the year.Furthermore, on a three-year basis, reinvestment risk appears to be a bigger enemy than duration. In a soft-landing or recession, price return and carry could lead longer duration bonds to handily outperform cash. Meanwhile, in our stagflation bear case, cash outperforms core bonds by just five percentage points (see chart below).In equities, we stay defensive and still prefer the U.S. over the rest of the world. The bounce in U.S. equities over the last 30 days is in large part sentiment and positioning-driven, but is also supported by optimism that the Fed could slow the pace of rate hikes without a recession. The equity rally occurred in the face of higher interest rates and 2023 earnings estimates that continue to creep lower towards our expectation; with that said our $210 2023 earnings base case is still 12% below street consensus.

Index Definitions:
The
Standard and Poor’s 500 Index (S&P 500)
is a capitalization-weighted index of 500 stocks. The index is designed to measure performance of the broad domestic economy through changes in the aggregate market value of 500 stocks representing all major industries. The index was developed with a base level of 10 for the 1941–43 base period.
The
Goldman Sachs Financial Conditions Index (FCI)
is defined as a weighted average of riskless interest rates, the exchange rate, equity valuations, and credit spreads, with weights that correspond to the direct impact of each variable on GDP.
The
Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Liquidity Index
is a measure of prevailing liquidity conditions in the US Treasury market. This Index displays the average yield error across the universe of US Treasury notes and bonds with remaining maturity 1-year or greater, based off the intra-day Bloomberg relative value curve fitter. When liquidity conditions are favorable the average yield errors are small as any dislocations from fair value are normalized within a short time frame. Under stressed liquidity conditions, dislocations from fair value implied by the curve fitter can remain persistent resulting in large average yield errors. CBBT is the pricing source for all Treasury notes and bonds used in this index calculation.
The
JPM Investment Grade Index (JULI)
provides performance comparisons and valuation metrics across a carefully defined universe of investment grade corporate bonds, tracking individual issuers, sectors and sub-sectors by their various ratings and maturities.

This week, volatility in geopolitics spiked and the unraveling of the crypto world continued, but investors are focusing on some of the key economic drivers of the markets. While Ukrainians cheered the Russian withdrawal from Kherson last week, a rocket landed in Poland near its border with Ukraine and killed two Polish citizens, prompting Poland (a NATO member) to call an emergency meeting and raising fears of escalation. Several sources have since attributed it to a Ukrainian air defense system, and market fears subsided. FTX, the crypto exchange, officially filed for bankruptcy, with a balance sheet that reflected just $900M in liquid assets against $9B in liabilities. Institutional backers have written off hundreds of millions of dollars of value in their stakes.
Despite the gloomy news, U.S. economic data has cheered investor sentiment, as softer-than-expected Producer Price Index (PPI) data (core +0.3% m/m vs. expectations for +0.4%) lent support to the cooling inflation narrative. The market pricing for peak Fed Funds rate in the middle of next year has declined from over 5.1% just a couple of weeks ago to around 4.9%, while equity markets held steady.
Over in China, investors are looking through relatively weak economic data (a contraction in retail sales and disappointing fixed asset investment growth) and expect the weakness to prompt more easing measures from the government. Following the recent announcements in China regarding the fine-tuning of Covid measures and actions to boost the property market – two of the most significant drags on the economy – hopes are rising for a long-awaited policy shift towards supporting growth. In this week’s note, we take a look whether this represents a true turning point, what impact we expect from these policies, how it changes our view, and investment recommendations.
Strategy Question: Are the recent announcements in China a turning point?
First, a recap on those announcements:
Property market:
The PBoC and CBIRC released joint measures to support the housing market. The measures focused on providing credit support for developers with debt extension and restructuring. It encourages banks to increase financing for project completion. Importantly, there is relaxation around implicit ‘lifetime responsibilities’ for senior officers and relevant institutions from non-performing loans (a key problem when lending to the private sector vs state-owned companies).
Compared with previous rounds of policy support, the measures came from a higher echelon of government.
We think this is a meaningful policy signal that could imply more effective follow-through by the bureaucracy and China’s largely state-owned financial system. In our view, the joint announcement represents a bigger shift in the policy stance. After a year of rapid de-leveraging, policymakers are moving to arrest the downward spiral and limit the economic impact. The downward spiral happens when weak demand reduced cash flow to developers, increasing default risk, and weaker prices feed into less demand and appetite from financial institutions. It’s hard to say with certainty that this will be the turning point but if implementation is effective we could see the housing market bottoming earlier than previously assumed. While economic data would have a notable lag vis-à-vis the policy announcement, we will monitor local media for signs that loans are being extended and completion is picking up.On COVID:
Last week, China’s National Health Commission (NHC) released 20 measures to optimize pandemic control measures. The new measures will reduce the length and scope of quarantines, cancel circuit breakers on inbound flights, and reduce mobility restrictions.
In our view, the moves are aimed at minimizing the economic impact of the pandemic controls.
There is still an ongoing outbreak, where daily new cases have surged over the past three weeks, from <1,000 per day to >15,000, driven by rapid spread of Omicron subvariants. The geographic spread of the virus is the widest ever, with 203 cities reporting outbreaks as of November 13, from 100 cities during October. Two of China’s biggest cities, Guangzhou and Chongqing, are facing severe outbreaks and increased restrictions in some areas, while Beijing is tightening controls as cases rise.In terms of reducing economic impact, these measures could be meaningful, but the process would be bumpy
. For example, after the announcement, Chongqing – a city of 30 million people, immediately reclassified 65% of previous ‘medium-risk’ areas to ‘low-risk’. In a medium-risk zone, residents cannot leave homes and one person from each household may collect necessities from designated areas, and all businesses are shut. In a low-risk zone, residents can go out and businesses operate normally. On the other hand, many cities are going through a spike in cases and restrictions. In Guangzhou, targeted relaxation and tightening are happening simultaneously (in different residential areas).
We expect activity data to trend weaker near-term. But if targeted easing is successful, we should see activity bouncing back faster
(in theory restrictions are removed more swiftly, rather than linger due to bureaucratic inertia). We would need to monitor daily cases, local media reports and high frequency numbers in coming weeks.
Do these announcements change our macro view?
The distribution of risks around China’s economic outlook in 2023 has changed. Relative to our base case of ~3% GDP growth, previously we focused more on downside risks (larger export downturn could shave 0.5ppt off GDP growth). But given the policy shifts, there are now upside risks to consider - we estimate the shifts could be worth 1ppt upside to growth in 2023.
In terms of upside risks for housing, it is important to note that even if policies are implemented today, it would take a few months for the effects to show in economic data. It takes time for financial institutions to roll out financing support and the positive cashflow effect to put a floor on investment, land buying and sentiment. In the meantime, bad numbers will likely continue (housing sales in the first two weeks of November is down 23% y-o-y, a bigger contraction than October). But if the downward spiral is arrested, the physical market could bottom earlier (mid-2023 instead of 2024), at a higher level (annual housing sales at ~1.1bn sqm, instead of 0.9bn sqm). Sales will be key to watch –
these measures are on supply rather than demand, so it’s difficult to gauge how effective they would be on stimulating home purchases.
Assuming that more targeted measures can be implemented successfully, it is possible that swifter removal of restrictions will allow household consumption to bounce back faster. This may amount to some upside risk to consumption (retail sales could grow 5%, rather than 1% YTD), which translates into 0.5ppt upside risk to GDP. While this does not reach pre-COVID levels of consumption growth, it will be higher than much of 2022. For COVID policy, whilst it is likely to have a diminishing impact with continued targeted finetuning, it could also be that “things may get worse before they get better”. With winter coming, high frequency activity could be depressed. In Guangzhou, metro traffic is down 30% from the previous week. Domestic flights are down 0.2% from the previous week and running at 62% of 2022 levels. Risk aversion and tightening of restrictions will continue to affect activity.
What about for the currency and credit?
In FX, since the beginning of 2022, we have been highlighting higher USDCNH. Given recent developments, we might see a short-term pause. Given the RMB is a pro-cyclical currency, it will likely benefit from a more positive view on Chinese assets (which stem from revised growth expectations). This will likely be a dominant driver in the near-term, particularly as it coincides with the hope of ‘peak Fed hawkishness’ that weighed on the USD. As such we could see the RMB strengthening vs. USD in the near-term. How long the reversal last depends on whether China’s economic growth will buck the trend of a global downturn next year. For now, as we head into a global downturn in 2023, a smaller trade surplus will be a headwind for the RMB a 12-month horizon.These announcements are an overall positive for China property credit, more so for non-distressed/quality developers than defaulted/distressed developers. The support would help stronger developers receive sufficient financing and reduce default risk. Non-distressed private developers could benefit. For distressed developers, it’s less likely that banks pull out of existing loans, while new funding is unlikely. We expect positive short-term performance in the sector but a more sustainable rally would depend on sales recovery. We would suggest clients to sell distressed names on the rally. For non-distressed names, we see short-term default risk lifted, while long-term uncertainty persists.What are our thoughts on equities?
The Hang Seng Index (HSI) rebounded by ~20% in the last 2 weeks on rising hopes of a policy pivot. Equity investors are increasingly convinced that Beijing is refocusing on economic growth. We believe this change in expectation is the major reason behind this rebound. However, if expectations are not met in a few months, markets will likely sell down again.
We expect volatility to continue and remain broadly cautious until we see a more concrete confirmation of a shift.
These measures are unlikely to lead to a material upgrade in property developers’ earnings forecasts in the near-term, as housing demand remains weak. Distressed developers would not benefit; major beneficiaries would be privately-owned enterprises which have not publicly defaulted.
We remain cautious on banks, as they continue to do national service and use balance sheets to rescue the property sector. The bad debt ratio for developers has already reached an alarming 3% in the 1H 2022. Reclassification of bad debt seems to have helped, but equity investors in Chinese banks may likely give a bigger valuation discount. We continue to avoid Chinese banks, especially smaller regional banks with weaker risk controls and higher exposure to distressed developers. We do not foresee high structural risks for Big Four banks, and they offer yield support, but we expect them to continue underperforming the market.
Chinese earnings are unlikely to be revised up meaningfully.
The recent rebound is within our expectation and remains technical in nature, driven mainly by short covering. We do not see long-only funds coming back to China meaningfully yet. We continue to monitor positive developments in four areas for a fundamental upgrade, namely: 1) concrete loosening of mobility restrictions, 2) effective implementation of property measures leading to improved sales, 3) more large-scale stimulus to revive the economy, especially consumption (rising credit growth), and 4) alleviation of geopolitical tensions that increases global flows into Chinese equities.Tactically, how authorities approach the outbreak in Guangzhou would offer interesting signals. Controlling the virus could require extensive lockdowns (contrary to market expectations). Maintaining looser restrictions could support the view that authorities are more tolerant of living with the virus. Our expectations still skew negative. Tactical traders are likely to lock in profits, while short-sellers will start rebuilding positions; fundamental investors could question policy effectiveness and refocus on China’s economic slowdown. Our MSCI China 2022 year-end target of 50-53 suggests mild downside. We would not recommend fundamental investors to chase this rally; momentum traders should set tight stop-losses given the technical nature of this rebound.
As the market approaches overbought levels, investors with over-sized HK/China equity positions can hedge or lower risk. For investors with cash and limited China exposure, they would consider China consumption recovery names which led this rally and remains our preferred part of the market. We also recommend monetizing high volatility to hedge against downside risk or participate in upside opportunities.
Conclusions and looking ahead
The challenge is determining the policy direction based on Chinese policy statements, seeing that there are many goals policymakers want to accomplish multiple goals at once. The latest measures are consistent with past announcements: the government has been trying for months to fine-tune Covid restrictions to limit the economic impact, and to limit downside risks in the property market without resorting to a public bailout. The key will be concrete signals that the measures are having real effects. With regards to Covid, we’re watching approvals of new pharmaceuticals and a vaccination campaign to prepare the population. For whether housing policies are getting traction, the best indicators are a pickup in housing sales and acceleration in private-sector credit growth.All market and economic data as of November 17, 2022 and sourced from Bloomberg Finance L.P. and FactSet unless otherwise stated.

Market update
June in bloom
June is off to a sunnier start after a cloudy spring:
After a whole lot of flurry, the debt ceiling is pretty much resolved. Both the House and Senate have passed the Biden-McCarthy deal.
The labor market is still red hot (today’s job report blew past estimates), but inflation is showing more signs of decelerating. ISM’s manufacturing prices paid gauge declined meaningfully in May. Prices in the euro area also cooled.
And after a string of lackluster data, a read on Chinese manufacturing activity started growing again. Rumor also has it the government is mulling new support for the property sector.
In all, the S&P 500 looks to notch a gain on the week, even with questions over the Federal Reserve’s next move. And while the stock rally is
broader than meets the eye
, there’s still no denying that big tech has been a powerhouse. NVIDIA made it into the exclusive $1 trillion market cap club this week, joining the ranks of Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon. The stock is now up an eye-popping +175% just this year—making it the best-performing company in the S&P 500. Those five stocks also account for +8.7% out of the S&P 500’s +10.7% year-to-date total return.
In today’s note, we dig into the tech hype, and what it might tell us about where markets are heading.
Spotlight
The tech hype
For all the buzz, it’s also important to keep the gains in context:
A wider lens shows tech has just been playing catch-up to the broader market after a really ugly 2022:What lessons can be learned from big tech’s big reversal? And can it keep going? Last week, J.P. Morgan hosted its 51st annual Technology, Media and Telecom Conference, where we heard straight from the key players. Here is what we took home:
Companies are focused on costs—but that can be a good thing.
The recession obsession has been in play for over a year, and companies have used all that time to prepare. Part of tech’s reckoning was a serious retrenchment, refocusing spending and leading the rest of the economy in lay-off
announcements and other cost cuts. Through it all, tech went through several quarters of negative earnings growth; but now, expectations are rising again, the sector is leading broad market earnings revisions higher, and margins are higher. And that’s all as the recession still hasn’t hit.Our take
: Tech’s tale can teach us a few things about where the broad market might be heading. For one, expectations are powerful and can empower C-suites and investors alike to get ready for what’s to come. Moreover, different industries can correct at different times, enabling the stock market at large to march on even as the macro road grows more challenging. That’s not to say it’ll all be smooth sailing from here—we expect volatility. But we do think it means that 2022’s bear market is a bygone. The market is not the economy.
Consumers are still healthy.
Payment bellwethers such as Visa, Mastercard and PayPal all called out a strong consumer. That ties with last week’s read on consumer spending, which jumped 0.8% in April—up from 0.1% in February and March, and outpacing inflation. Americans shelled out for travel, concert tickets and even big-ticket items such as vehicles. Q1 earnings reports from retailers echoed that strength, but also warned of challenges ahead.
Our take
: If you have a job and a steady paycheck, why stop spending? There’s still 1.8 job openings available for every unemployed American, and wages are growing over 4% year-over-year. But initial signs suggest consumers may be getting a bit over their skis, now spending more than they’re taking in each month. With excess savings dwindling to about $1 trillion (from a $2.5 trillion zenith), many are turning to debt to keep spending as usual. At some point, the rubber may meet the road.
The AI hype is real, and it’s here.
Name a buzzier buzzword than “AI.”
You’ve probably heard: Generative AI is creating art and music that sounds like your favorite bands. Large language processing models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are completing tasks in a fraction of the time it would take humans, from passing a U.S. medical licensing exam to beating seasoned stockpickers. ChatGPT has reached one million users more quickly than any other application.But what’s more, companies are already monetizing it. Last week, semiconductor stalwart NVIDIA bested earnings expectations by almost 20%, and that’s not all: The company raised its Q2 sales guidance to $11 billion—a staggering ~$4 billion ahead of consensus as the AI boom fuels chip demand.
Our take
:
We see a lot of value in AI, too
. AI is creating new profit pools for the tech sector, and investor interest only seems to be growing. Many companies can benefit across the value chain—from semiconductors and hyperscalers to data infrastructure and consumer applications. There may be pain points ahead (from output accuracy to data privacy), but
the opportunities
are immense.Investment considerations
So are we in a bull market now?
Maybe. At the very least, we think the worst is over for stocks. To be sure, questions over regional banks, sticky inflation and full valuations could trigger sell-offs...but at the same time, corporate profits have been solid, earnings expectations are now ticking up, and positioning remains fairly light. To us, that means sell-offs are buying opportunities.
Tech’s ascent may also not need to be a bad thing. We think the rally broadens from here, even as growth slows. While we’re believers in the next wave of digital innovation, we’re also focused on themes such as dividend growth, the energy transition and the real economy. Small- and mid-cap stocks can complement large-cap holdings, and opportunities also look ripe in Europe and China.

FEMALE VOICE:  This podcast has been prepared exclusively for institutional, wholesale professional clients and qualified investors only as defined by local laws and regulations.  Please read other important information, which can be found on the link at the end of the podcast episode.
MR. MICHAEL CEMBALEST:  Good morning, welcome to the Eye on the Market 2023 Energy Paper podcast.  This year’s paper is called Growing Pains: The Renewable Transition in Adolescence.  Every year when I write this paper, it’s kind of an amazing experience.  I share it, I screen it with some clients and some friends, some academics in advance.  And every year, including this year, there are people that respond by saying, well, this is really well researched, it’s fascinating, I learned so much, but it really bummed me out.  I was kind of hoping to read something different.
And happens all the time, and I’m kind of amazed that I got that feedback this year because we start the paper with a lot of good news.  I mean, there are certain things about the transition that are accelerating, and we haven’t even kicked in the US and the European energy bills yet.  So there’s a lot of good news here, but it shows you as a Rorschach test, people still somehow believe that this transition can be accomplished in a few years, whereas it takes decades for energy transitions to take place, and some of the things that are keeping the transition from happening more quickly, most people either don’t know about or when they find out about them, don’t do anything about them and don’t lobby to change them and don’t vote accordingly.  So anyway, this podcast is not meant as a substitute for reading the piece.  It’s 50 pages with a gazillion charts on it.  But I want to give you a sense for what we worked on this year.
So there’s lots of good news to share, clean tech, investment is soaring.  As I mentioned even before the energy bills, wind and solar generation globally exceeded nuclear for the first time last year.  The IEA projects this year if you make it to the end of this decade, you will probably see peak global fossil fuel demand.  At least that’s what the IEA is projecting even in their slower transition case.  Over the next five years, there may be as much renewable capacity added as over the prior 20 years.  EV sales are picking up globally.  Residential heat pump adoption is rising rapidly in the US and Europe in response to rising energy prices.  Battery plant buildout in the United States is really picking up speed.  The cost of storage has declined, energy storage, to the point where combining it with a utility-scale solar facility in some locations is now competitive with gas peaker plants.  Last year China added more renewable capacity than the US, Europe, India, Asia, and Latin America combined.  And so there’s a lot of good news about how the transition is picking up speed.  And this was all listed on the first page, and some of the feedback I got was that people were still a little disappointed.
And look, despite all those good news, the decarbonization of energy use is going to be a gradual process.  There’s been about $6 trillion spent on renewable energy since 2005, another $3 trillion spent on electricity networks, and the world is still about 80% reliant on fossil fuels, down from 85% in 2005.  It’s hard to electrify certain forms of industrial, commercial, residential, and transport energy use.  So this paper gets into what’s going on here.
For the most part, renewable energy today is displacing the fossil fuels that power your HVAC systems in homes and buildings.  That is overwhelmingly what renewable energy does today.  It also decarbonizes a little bit of industrial energy use, and global oil consumption would be 2% higher without all the electric cars and vans and trucks and buses in the world.  But the pillars of modern society, steel, cement, ammonia, fertilizer, plastics, glass, rubber cement are still made using fossil fuels, particularly in the developing countries to whom the West outsourced all of that stuff in the first place.
We do discuss up front, there is evidence pointing to the need for more rapid transition, and none of this is new information, but we’ve correlated some of it, rising open ocean temperatures, rising sea levels, the falling ice sheet mass and things like that.  But if that’s the case, this paper discusses some of the transitions’ primary obstacles, permitting delays for generation and transmission, a lack of eminent domain in the West, resource nationalism, and the availability of critical minerals to support the transition, the very high cost needed to decarbonize industrial heat, the backup thermal power and storage costs and logistics to accompany intermittent wind and solar power, probably the topic that’s been misreported on most over the last 15 years.  Challenges for grid managers, integrating thousands of new wind and solar projects, and then the long useful lives of existing machines, vehicles, and furnaces, and the time it takes for societies to build new ones to utilize new forms of energy.
And if that’s what’s constraining the pace of change, I’m unconvinced that starving the oil and gas industry of capital is going to make the transition go any faster, particularly since new pools of capital will just step in as long as demand for fossil fuels exist.  And Europe is Exhibit A for what happens when you mismanage your access to thermal energy while the renewable transition is ongoing.  So I think the handful of countries in the world that have oil and gas reserves, even though the renewable transition is picking up speed, don’t quit your day job.  You’re going to need those oil and gas reserves for many years to come.
The paper starts out with an executive summary that takes a detailed look at the goals and the realities of the energy transition.  In this section, we look at the efforts behind electrification and grid decarbonization.  And it’s important to understand that there’s two different transitions going on.  One is can we make the grid greener by adding wind and solar, and the second is can we electrify other forms of energy use so that we can then decarbonize it?
And one of them is easier to do than the other one.  The greenification of the grid, there’s a chart on page six, is happening about twice the speed as the electrification of overall energy use.  And that’s important to understand.  Electricity use is only 20 or 30% in most countries, particularly the larger ones, of overall energy consumption.  So even if you decarbonize substantial portions of the grid, you’re not really doing as much as you think unless you can start electrifying other kinds of energy use.
And so the industrial sector, for example, is the biggest consumer globally of fossil fuels.  So the executive summary discusses the four sections in order: the industrial sector, then transport, then residential buildings, and then commercial buildings in terms of for the prospects of electrifying and otherwise decarbonizing them.  And the short answer is electrification in industrial energy use is a really hard thing to do, and you don’t have to look any further than the United States, where the electricity share of industrial energy consumption has been unchanged for 40 years.
So you’re going to read tons of articles on decarbonization of steel and cement and concrete and glass and fertilizer and ammonia and other chemicals.  All of those are interesting pilot projects, they deserve the support they get.  But the electrification of industrial energy use in the US has been unchanged for four decades, at about a 15, 14% share.  It’s a very hard thing to do.
As it relates to transportation, there’s some great news on battery-electric vehicles.  They were 10% of global passenger cars last year.  They rose almost 70%, another 40% gain projected for 2023.  All of that is good news.  Two issues to think about.  One is it takes time for the percentage of EV sales to impact the fleet.  We have a chart in here on the US showing the EV share of light-duty vehicle sales soaring, whereas the overall EV share of the light-duty fleet itself and miles traveled and gasoline consumption is much, much smaller.  Cars last 12 to 15 years now.  You know, every time we run out of one, we give one to one of my wife’s friends and they keep driving it for several years.  So that’s part of the issue here, which is the long useful life of the existing internal combustion engines.
The other thing to think about, passenger cars only represent globally about a quarter of oil consumption, so the progress that you make decarbonizing passenger cars will have to be accompanied by progress on decarbonizing the oil that gets used in other road freight, aviation and shipping, and in the production of chemicals and other kinds of industrial energy use.  So it does look like over the next 10 to 20 years, global oil consumption will stop accelerating at the same pace it did historically.  It just may take quite a while for oil consumption to consistently register below let’s say 100 million barrels a day.
And the best news probably is on the commercial and residential building heat.  They are smaller categories, but they still use a lot of fossil fuels, and here the development of really efficient heat pumps over the last decade is very good news, ‘cause not only does that electrify the use, electrify heat, but it does so in a very efficient way, which results in less overall energy consumption as well.  And we have some information here on how Europe and the US, you’re finally starting to see heat pump sales displace gas furnaces and other boilers.  So the executive summary walks through the major uses of fossil fuels and the prospects behind decarbonizing them.  And that’s the section that I think is the most important to read.
We also have some individual sections on topics that we think are important.  One of them is this whole issue of levelized cost of energy for wind and solar power, which we think is kind of an irrelevant calculation because it’s only looking at the cost of a marginal megawatt hour and not looking at all of the other costs necessary in terms of storage or backup power that you need to build systems with lots of wind and solar power.  So there’s a numbers in, garbage out problem with levelized cost of energy.
We look at issues around grid expansion and renewable interconnection in the US and Europe.  The grid is being expanded at a fraction of the pace that’s necessary for deep decarbonization plans.
We look in detail, there’s a long section on the issue of critical minerals.  And what’s important to understand about critical minerals is that they are not really scarce.  All these transition minerals are not very scarce.  There’s at least 40 years of supply based on production relative to global reserves and relative to global resources, which as a broader category there’s even more.  The question is who has them and will they sell them, and at what price, and how much would it cost for countries that don’t currently process them or produce them to start doing so and how long that would take.  So it’s really a question of resource availability rather than scarcity on critical minerals.
We talk about the rise of projects with colocated storage and solar power now that storage costs have declined, municipal solid waste as a source of energy, and the dispute over forest biomass in Europe.  There’s a section on carbon capture.  I’ve been known to say, I’ve written in the past that the single highest ratio in the history of science is the ratio of academic papers written on carbon sequestration divided by actual carbon sequestration.  So the hit rate of these CCS projects has been historically very low.  That may change a little with some new incentives and economies of scale, but I still think the math argues against a large contribution here over the next 10 to 15 years.
And then we have a section called California Dreaming, which is on some futuristic ideas that I don’t think are going to be making any contribution, meaningful contribution at all over the next 10 to 15 years so you can just ignore them.  Electric planes, nuclear fusion, solar power based in space, outer space, direct air carbon capture, and fully autonomous car networks.
And then we end with an epilogue on how Europe survived the winter, what they’re facing going forward, and the risks of deindustrialization, and then what comes next in the Russia/China energy partnership.  And then there’s an appendix at the end, an important one, with a methane update, because some aerial and drone studies are showing leakage rates of methane in the US that are much higher than the methane data that the oil and gas industry reports to the EPA.
So here are some concluding thoughts for this year.  I see a lot of energy papers where the authors are projecting seismic changes in the energy landscape by 2050, and where some of the transitions involved kick in in 2035 or 2040.  I have no idea how they have visibility that far out or claim to.  Decarbonization of electricity, passenger cars, and winter heating in homes and buildings is definitely advancing in many parts of the world.  We can see that.  And in the developed world, fossil fuel use and emissions are almost certainly starting to plateau.  That much we can see.  But that’s about all we can see here.  The future is a lot less clear than what a lot of these reports are projecting.
And as an example of that, one of the think tanks that we’ve spoken to that modeled the energy bill on behalf of the Senate and for Schumer and Manchin made these projections of massive solar and wind expansion, GHG declines, and other major transitions in vehicles and truck, 90% of long-haul trucks decarbonized by 2030 in terms of percentage of sales.  And we were struck by how aggressive and optimistic the forecast was.
And then we saw it in kind of a small font the following caveat, if you were able to spot it in this report.  Several constraints that are difficult to model may limit these growth rates in practice, including the ability to site and permit projects at the requisite pace and scale to expand electricity transmission, to expand the transport of Co2, and to expand storage to accommodate the new generation capacity and to hire and train the expanded energy workforce needed to build them.
So in other words, as long as the reality of the world in which we live doesn’t get in the way, all of the goals are achievable rapidly.  That’s how I think you should interpret a lot of these long-dated energy projections from Wall Street firms and think tanks and governments.  They’re assuming that the only important driver here are the subsidies and an optimized world in which people take advantage of them, whereas in reality it’s a lot more complicated than that.  And we talk about the technology and policy and chemistry and physics and nationalism issues that get in the way each year.
And my view is that the fossil fuel demand is going to evolve closer to the slower of one of the IEA scenarios.  And if that’s the case, it would be premature to rely on renewable energy for more than it is organically capable of providing, in which case the countries that constrain access to fossil fuels prematurely like Europe did are going to end up regretting it.
So that’s the end of this year’s podcast.  Thank you very much for listening, and I’ll be back to you shortly with another Eye on the Market podcast on the banking deposit situation in both the US and Europe.  Thanks for listening, bye.

Thank you so much for inviting me to this prestigious awards tonight. The awards are a culmination of the annual Global Private Banking and Wealth Management Survey, which provides a qualitative review of the best services in private banking by region and by area of service.
We feel absolutely privileged to be here accepting these because it is peer-driven, because it's been driven by us. Two years ago, 18th of February, 2020, we came to these awards in the city, and I think none of us realized what would happen. Everything changed for our lives, as people so eloquently said. But some things remain the same.
And that is, for 18 years, the absolute gold standard in financial journalism, particularly for our field of private banking, has been Euromoney. So I think everybody that's here tonight and when you go back to your teams feels that we have an ecosystem of the industry led by the banks, led by the work we do for clients, but also led by the journalistic integrity that we have led extremely well by Euromoney. So Elliot, you and your team, we are so thankful and delighted, A, to be invited, and B, to be the recipient of these awards.","Mar 30, 2023",,"

Market update
Bank angst. Where do we go from here?
Everything is coming to a head at the same time.
Bank stress continues to rear its head, the Federal Reserve probably just concluded one of its most aggressive rate hiking cycles in history, and the U.S. debt ceiling is also looming. Stocks have felt the heat this week—the S&P 500 is down over 2% heading into Friday, and the KBW Bank Index has seen its worst week since March. Meanwhile, bonds are proving a worthy ballast, as yields (particularly on the short end) have fallen across the board.
Futures this morning point to some stress abating, and markets do seem aware of where the greatest risks lie. While regional banks have seen a deep selloff (with acute losses this week from PacWest, Western Alliance and First Horizon), larger banks have seen less pain, and broad U.S. markets are still +6% higher so far this year.Yet even with the risks known, it’s hard to keep track of a puzzle with rapidly moving pieces. As the Fed signaled a pause could be in store after hiking 25 basis points at its meeting this week (to a target range of 5.00–5.25%, the highest since 2007), even policymakers painted a complicated backdrop—inflation remains hot, but growth is incrementally slowing and financial stability is still under threat.
Today, we hone in on the ongoing stress in regional banks and how policymakers could act to mitigate the pain.
The problem:
The worry, at least to some extent, seems to have moved on from deposit flight: Both PacWest (which is now considering a sale of its business) and Western Alliance noted they’ve actually seen deposits grow over this period of bank stress. Instead, the biggest concern looks like a question about the right valuation for banks that have made lots of loans at low interest rates (
see Michael Cembalest’s explainer on this
), and the future of the regional bank industry at large.
When growth slows, default rates tend to pick up as it gets harder for companies to turn a profit. Banks simultaneously face higher costs (from needing to offer more competitive deposit rates) and lower revenue growth (from a slowdown in loans), putting pressure on margins. It’s unclear how much damage might be in store, especially given that regional banks have outsized exposure to the
troubled commercial real estate sector
, and there are still several players that have big duration bets in their portfolios. On top of that, regional banks may be less able to return value to shareholders, as they’re facing the rebuilding of capital buffers to meet more stringent regulations.
All of this makes it really hard for investors to figure out what the right price is for banks that are looking more vulnerable. Again, the selloff has been deep, suggesting a lot of worry is already reflected—but there still could be more pain to come.But what can be done to stop the bleeding?
Five options for policymakers come to mind:
Lowering interest rates.
This could help troubled banks get a handle on the mismatch between their assets (loans and bond portfolios that have lost value as the Fed hiked) and liabilities (deposits that are competing with money market funds offering higher rates). The issue: The Fed said it’s not considering rate cuts right now with inflation still high—even as markets continue to bet on it.
Increasing liquidity:
The Fed kept quantitative tightening (QT) unchanged this week. Even as the Fed’s Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) and discount window ensure that the banks in need can get liquidity, QT still drains money from the financial system. This translates to pressure on deposits and tougher lending conditions, but ending QT probably won’t come until the Fed also cuts rates.
Deposit insurance reform:
A number of industry leaders have called for enhancing the FDIC’s deposit insurance, which currently guarantees that deposits are safe if a bank fails—but just up to a limit of $250,000. Upping or extending insurance could reduce the risk of further bank runs, but it’s politically contentious and would require action from Congress. Possible, but a tall feat.
Banning short-selling on bank stocks.
Losses in bank stocks have been compounded by short-sellers betting on lower prices. This means that even large banks on stronger footing have been caught up in the crosshairs. The SEC could ban short-selling without congressional approval as it did in 2008, but there’s some worry about the unintended impact of interfering in markets.
Supporting consolidation across regional banks.
Most expect some consolidation in regional banks. That might be why the First Horizon-TD Bank deal breakdown this week stirred up so much angst, especially as regulatory hurdles were cited as the cause. With the deal abandoned, investors took it as a sign that consolidation might not be all that easy if regulators draw strict lines.
In all, concern around regional banks is likely to keep swirling until policymakers forge a better path for the weakest links. Cutting rates seems to be the easiest solution, but as long as rates remain as high as they are, questions around future bank profitability and valuations of banks’ loan books may wear on. Yet, with inflation as high as it is, it’s not that straightforward.
But while these worries are all valid, investors should stay focused on the bigger picture.
The cracks are evident, but based on what we know now,
this episode doesn’t look like another 2008
. Not all banks are under duress. Earnings season has also shown impressive resilience from Corporate America: S&P 500 earnings growth looks to contract by -2.3% in Q1 over the prior year—still a slowdown, but a far cry from the over -7% expected heading into the quarter.
That said, continued bank stress does signal that things should slow down from here. Banks will probably lend less moving forward, and the ongoing credit crunch may be a slow burn—already, small businesses are reporting that credit is harder to find. That, in turn, should pressure growth, and eventually the jobs data (today's report showed the labor market is still too strong).
We remain focused on investments that are more defensive and that can offer protection in a downturn.
The quick collapse in yields this year—and just this week—demonstrates why bonds are essential. Strategies such as structured notes can help you stay invested in both the good days and the bad through protecting gains and building in a buffer from adverse moves lower. Given U.S. markets will probably be choppy for the remainder of this year, sectors such as reasonably priced technology, healthcare and industrials, as well as opportunities in Europe and China, could offer relative strength. Alternative assets are also well positioned to diversify portfolio risk.
Above all, stick with your investment plan. History suggests that investors who stick to their plans through periods of volatility and uncertainty are better positioned to grow their wealth over time. Your J.P.

Inflation and central banks continue to drive the volatile market narrative. Following last week’s hotter-than-expected CPI print and the strong jobs report the week prior, a 75bps rate hike at the November FOMC meeting seems all but cemented. Markets are pricing the Fed funds rate to peak at 5.0% by May next year, which is 40bps higher than it was heading into the print.
Elsewhere, the situation in the U.K. continued to be volatile. Under pressure from lawmakers and markets, the Truss administration reversed their proposed fiscal agenda. Kwasi Kwarteng was dismissed (after just 38 days in the job as Chancellor) while Jeremy Hunt was appointed in his place – making him the fourth person to hold the office in as many months. Furthermore, Liz Truss resigned as Prime Minister (just 45 days after taking office), setting up another Conservative Party leadership election due by 28 October. The Bank of England announced it will resume its quantitative tightening program at the end of the month, which follows two weeks of emergency easing in the aftermath of the government’s now reversed mini-budget and bond market turmoil. The continued tightening in policy is welcome – the latest U.K. CPI print showed inflation remained at a 40-year high, as prices rose 10.1% year-over-year (vs 9.9% the month before and expectations for 10%). With continued uncertainty in the U.K., this week’s note takes a step back to consolidate our views on the situation.
Strategy Question: Are U.K. pensions a global financial stability risk?
In late September, U.K. gilt yields surged at a speed and scale that was unprecedented. The most astounding were in the 30yr gilt, where yields soared by 1.5 percentage points in a matter of days. Statistically, this was an almost 10 standard deviation move. The magnitude of the shock exposed significant financial stability risks even in the supposedly stale U.K. Pension Liability Driven Investment (LDI) system.
We don’t think the U.K. LDI situation is a globally systemic risk in and of itself. With that said, this episode is emblematic of the risks that arise when global policy makers tighten policy this far, this fast.
The catalyst for the liquidity shock: poorly timed fiscal initiatives and eroding confidence
Even before the events of late September, the U.K. stood out in terms of its external and domestic funding vulnerabilities. The economy structurally imports more than it exports and the government spends more revenue than it generates. The U.K.’s “twin deficit” is on the order of 8% of GDP. The U.S. has a similar twin deficit, but has a crucial differentiator in the USD’s unique global role. A large twin deficit can lead to a weaker currency and higher government borrowing costs if foreign investors start to demand a “discount” to finance the country’s growing government and external deficits.Against that backdrop and surging inflation, on September 23rd the newly installed U.K. government proposed a largely unfunded fiscal expansion (aka a “mini budget”). Since then, the U.K. has been serving as a real-time example of what can happen when a country with a large external deficit reliant on foreign financing loses the confidence of global investors amid poorly timed policy initiatives. Despite surging yields, which likely to serve to lure global capital, the pound depreciated against all developed market peers. Versus the USD, the pound is the weakest on record. While U.K. policy makers are now reversing the proposed fiscal measures, confidence in them is likely harder to restore.Background: a Q&A on LDI
What is Liability Driven Investing (LDI)?
LDI is an investment strategy that looks to better match pension scheme investments with private sector defined benefit liabilities. It seeks to use assets to hedge and match the inflation and interest rate risk on pension liabilities in a capital efficient way with the use of derivatives such as interest rate and inflation-linked swaps.
Why was modern-day LDI created and how does it operate?
After a series of pension scheme scandals in the late 1980s/early 1990s, regulators tightened defined benefit rules and demanded that pension deficits be reported on balance sheets.
Around that time, actuaries began to treat future pension obligations as bond-like in their nature as they were simply seen as a series of forward starting cash flows with varying degrees of inflation protection. The future cash flows of a defined benefit scheme depend on a number of factors, such as the life expectancy of the scheme beneficiaries and inflation. These expected cash flows are then discounted to present value using long-dated interest rates. As a result, the pension’s obligation decreases when interest rates rise – and vice versa. Therefore pensions aim to match the duration of their assets to the duration of their liabilities so swings in interest rates do not cause the funded ratio to change dramatically.
How large is the U.K. LDI market? How do they allocate their assets?
Commonly agreed upon estimates of total size is ~1.5tr pounds. For context, 1.5tr is about:
40% of the U.K. Institutional Asset Management marketplace,
Roughly half of the U.K.’s GDP
Bigger than the U.K. Government’s total debt outstanding (excluding gilts held by the BOE).
Fixed income (and specifically U.K. bonds) are the biggest holding, but growth and illiquid assets are also meaningful holdings. Interestingly, cash holdings have become increasingly negative in recent years – implying some use of leverage.The mechanics of the liquidity shock: rates spiked too fast and the LDI community did not have enough liquid collateral
Ideally, LDI schemes match the duration of the liabilities with government bonds
(or close equivalents), thus minimizing risk within the scheme. However, two problems made that untenable in recent decades:
The starting basis was an under-funding of defined benefit pension plans. Pensions needed a way to more efficiently hedge interest rate risk, while making some additional return. With the persistent decline in yields over the last few decades, this ideal strategy would not have matched liabilities and assets. As rates go down, the liabilities go up in value as you are discounting future cash flows back at a lower rate. In 2020 the U.K. Pensions Regulator estimated that every 0.1% fall in gilt yields increases U.K. Scheme liabilities by ~£23.7bn, meaning that the decade rally in yields until Dec 2020 increased U.K. pension liabilities by about 960bn (or 40% of GDP).
The free float of U.K. government bonds (~1.2tr) is smaller than LDI assets (~1.5tr), so a strictly government bond asset mix isn’t feasible.
In response to these challenges the LDI community made two major adjustments that made them ill prepared for a historic surge higher in yields
.
They increasingly moved into riskier and more illiquid asset classes such as equities, real assets, private equity and CLOs (Collateralized Loan Obligations) to generate returns and help fund the pensions.
They deployed leverage overlays that were more capital efficient to match the duration of their assets to liabilities. Specifically, asset managers used their gilt holdings in the repo market to generate incremental cash that could be used to buy more assets.  In addition, they used interest rate derivatives that mimic long duration exposure by only posting initial margin, thus freeing up capital for other investments while still allowing the pension fund to target the appropriate duration. While theoretically a large spike in U.K. rates helps to reduce both the size of pension fund liabilities and assets, the asset side faces a liquidity issue as margin is depleted and needs to be restored.
The liquidity shock prompted two major consequences for LDI managers.
Leverage overlay strategies lost value quickly
given the speed and scale of the gilt move, and LDI managers needed liquidity to meet margin calls. Given the speed of the rate rise, managers sold whatever they could to raise liquidity to post more margin. This caused some contagion risk into other assets.
The prevalent use of central clearing
of “pooled funds” meant further forced selling
. According to a 2019 Pension Regulator Survey, around 30% of LDI schemes deployed assets in such funds. A pooled LDI account manages assets for a large number of small pension schemes, often employing the use of leverage. If a pooled LDI asset manager needs funding quickly to meet margin requirements, it is more likely to sell assets to raise liquidity as smaller corporate sponsors are unlikely to have excess liquidity to fund the pension.
The short-term approach: the Bank of England
The large and sudden increase in long-dated gilt yields prompted
LDI funds to urgently rebalance, either by selling gilts (or other less liquid assets) or asking their corporate sponsors for more cash/collateral (which is unlikely). This was a particular problem for pooled LDI funds. Given the large number of smaller investors in these funds, there is a risk of causing forced deleveraging by selling gilts into a market unable to absorb sales, thereby sparking a self-reinforcing spiral of price falls and further pressure to sell gilts.
Critically, the liquidity shock is not a solvency shock. In fact, funding ratios have skyrocketed, which is good for LDI managers on the back of higher rates. While higher rates drive down the value of the assets held in an LDI strategy, the liabilities are longer duration and higher rates, meaning those liabilities declined more in today’s terms than the assets.To offer liquidity, the BOE stepped in as the lender of last resort. It offered to purchase up to £65 billion in long-dated gilts and linkers over a 14-day period. This liquidity infusion provided time and space for LDI schemes to gather cash/collateral and unwind some of their riskier/less liquid asset holdings. Over the long run, more portfolio construction changes are likely.
What are the global transmission channels?
We don’t think the U.K. LDI situation is a globally systemic risk in and of itself. With that said, this episode is emblematic of the risks that arise when global policy makers tighten policy this far, this fast; things tend to break – and this may be just one domino in a longer string. Here is what we are watching:
1. Continued forced selling emanating from the U.K
.. Despite BOE action, interest rates in the U.K. are nearly back to where they were in the wake of the mini-budget announcement. This suggests liquidity needs may not have been met and more selling may be necessary.2. Funding stress
.
Any time major markets move in unprecedented size and speed, cash (particularly USD) is often raised quickly and at punitive borrowing costs as a precaution. We are starting to see signs that market participants are paying up for short-term U.S. dollar funding, but to be fair, other stresses in Europe and year-end activity are also likely contributing.
3. Global uncertainty is serving to tighten financial conditions further
.
In the U.S. we softly proxy uncertainty by the spread between the Fed’s long run projected Fed funds rate versus the market pricing for the Overnight Index Swap (OIS) in nine years. At 90 basis points, the spread is the widest it’s been since the Fed started offering projections in 2012 – which is indicative of significant uncertainty.What are the implications for the U.K. economy and assets?
This event represents a significant tightening in financial conditions for the U.K. economy. At the end of September, the U.K. SONIA curve was pricing in 140 bps of rate hikes in November followed by another 100bps in December. The terminal rate seen by the market moved much higher post mini budget and almost reached a peak of 6% mid 2023, although this has since fallen to 5.6%. The shock of higher rates will present challenges to lending and interest rate-sensitive economic activity. In the U.K., about one third of homes are owned outright, one third are rented, and one third have a mortgage. Eighty-three percent of mortgages are fixed in the U.K. (on much shorter fixings) versus ~93% in the U.S.. Twenty-five percent of U.K. mortgages need refinancing in the next year– and thus interest rate sensitivity is high. Loan loss provisions are already increasing, but likely need to go higher. There is also potential downside to consumption as living costs remain elevated with high inflation.
In investments, we remain cautious on U.K. equity indices and the British pound (with an outlook of 1.03-1.07 by year-end and 1.13-1.17 by Q3 2023), in spite of the substantial repricing, given ongoing policy risk and a weak domestic backdrop.All market and economic data as of October 20, 2022 and sourced from Bloomberg Finance L.P. and FactSet unless otherwise stated.

As Q3 earnings season ramps up, volatility in equity markets continued as reports and guidance from some big tech companies disappointed investors, dragging down the index after a few sessions of rallies. The earnings story so far has been mixed, with varying experiences by sector and company. Despite weakness in certain areas, other companies held up well, especially those linked to the still-resilient U.S. consumer. Light positioning has also helped to cushion markets from a technical perspective. Amidst the swings, a slightly less hawkish tone seemed to be creeping into the narrative – there was some chatter about “peak yields”, with some Fed officials warning about the risks of overtightening, which pulled down expectations for a peak Fed funds rate from over 5% last week back to around 4.85%. Also setting the tone is the U.S. dollar index, now trading several percentage points off its highs at its weakest level in a month. To add to the mix, the Bank of Canada raised rates by 50bps instead of an expected 75bps move. Markets would continue to contend with the forces of tighter monetary policy and slowing growth in the coming months.
In Asian markets, it was an even more eventful week. In the wake of the 20th CCP Congress, which concluded on October 22nd, Chinese assets saw a historic selloff. In the early part of this week, the MSCI China was down over 8% and the Hang Seng Index was down over 7%, at one point coming close to breaching 15,000, a level not seen since the depths of the 2008 financial crisis. Even onshore markets were not spared, with the CSI 300 Index dipping around 4%. The Chinese Yuan was also down over 2% against the dollar. While those assets have since bounced back somewhat, many uncertainties remain over China’s near-term economic challenges and its longer-term policy direction, especially amongst global investors. In this week’s note, we address some of the top questions on China, and refresh our views on the Chinese economy and assets.
Strategy Question: Addressing questions on China
Bottom line on top - What are our China-related investment recommendations?
In terms of our views for Chinese assets, we have a neutral view on risk assets (equities and credit). We have a bias for lower core bond yields and a weaker RMB vs. the USD with an outlook of around 7.3 for year-end. For equities, MSCI China is now trading close to an 11-year low, with a valuation of ~8.5x forward P/E, which is below -1 standard deviation. Despite seemingly attractive valuations, China’s current policy regime may be maintained until the Central Economic Working Conference in December when economic targets will be decided, or the Two Sessions in March 2023. Poor sentiment and liquidity outflows will likely continue to dominate market movements in the near term, but investors with high cash levels and under-exposure to China equities can continue to enhance the overall quality of their portfolio by switching from low quality, expensive names into high quality stocks. We continue to prefer onshore A-shares on a relative basis over offshore markets, given lower liquidity outflow pressure and higher weightings towards the domestic consumption and industrial sectors (especially defense and automation).Fundamentally, we think earnings expectations are fair, but there is more room for multiple contraction in view of the economic headwinds and policy uncertainty. We take down our MSCI China 2022 year-end/ 12-month outlook to 50-53 and 52-56 respectively (from 58-61/ 63-67 previously) to reflect this higher perceived risk premium, implying 9x forward P/E (-1 SD) and 0.9x P/B. We also revised down our 2022E/23E EPS forecast mildly by 1-2 percentage points, putting us in line with consensus for 2022 and 7% below consensus for 2023. Our bear/bull case September 2023 outlook is also revised down to 43-46/ 62-66 accordingly. We also moderate our CSI300 outlook to 3,800-4,000 (from 4,200-4,400).
What drove this week’s volatility?
Chinese equities, particularly offshore China, dropped significantly on Monday with MSCI China down 8%. The Hang Seng Index also experienced one of its worst days, with the index closing down 6.4% on very large trading volumes. Putting this into context, that there were only six occasions over the past 20 years when index daily returns were worse, and they all happened in 2008. The index has since recovered some losses, but is still down about 4% from the end of last week. This sentiment was also reflected in currency markets with USDCNH strengthening significantly by nearly 2%, and briefly touching 7.36.
Given such large moves, many investors are trying to understand the drivers of global sentiment. The specific drivers of a selloff are always hard to pinpoint over the short-term, but some combination of uncertainty over the policy direction, recent news flow around additional pandemic measures in Guangdong, in addition to significant technical selling pressure due to structured products being exercised all appear to have played a role. Markets appear to have been primed for positive catalysts around economic policy, such as a reduced focus on lockdowns or more forceful stimulus – which were not directly addressed during the sessions. This should not be a surprise, the Party Congress has traditionally focused on personnel instead of short-term economic policy. Nonetheless, given the downward economic pressures, markets were hopeful – and were likely to be disappointed. In addition, the market was already having to deal with a multitude of headwinds this year – including a historically fast-paced monetary tightening and a recent expansion of U.S. semiconductor export controls. These challenges have affected global sentiment and flows, with a notable shift down in net flows into Chinese equities since February.
What does the recent GDP and activity data tell us?
This week's GDP data showed China’s economy stabilized in the third quarter after a sequential contraction in the second quarter. Consumption contributed positively to growth again, after being a sizable drag over the summer. Investment growth accelerated and exports continued to hold up. The stabilization reflected a loosening of mobility restrictions over the summer and followed a series of policy measures to put a floor beneath falling housing market activities. Fiscal spending kicked into a higher gear. Resilient global growth and domestic industrial demand also helped.But in terms of growth momentum, activity actually slowed in September compared with August. The slowdown is most notable in household consumption, reflecting a decline in intra-city and inter-city mobility in September, which has lasted through most of October. In particular, consumer spending on restaurants contracted by nearly 2% year-over-year in September. This item alone shaved one percentage point off headline retail sales growth (which slowed from 5.4% year-over-year in August to 2.5% in September). Discretionary spending (on items such as jewelry or white goods) was also more subdued. The property sector downturn continued, albeit with less speed. In contrast, manufacturing activity is still quite strong and infrastructure spending by the government is growing at a double-digit rate. On the whole, it will be difficult for the resilience in the industrial sector to offset the downturn in both consumer spending and the housing market.
Mobility restrictions were in place through most of October, although they have eased at the margin over the past week. As such, we shall see consumption growth remaining quite subdued in October before recovering sequentially in the last two months of the year. However, the recent tightening of rules around dining out in parts of Guangzhou may suggest a rapid recovery could be less likely. So far this year, on average households have been less inclined to spend, and more inclined to save. According to the PBOC’s urban depositors survey, the appetite to consume is the lowest since March 2020, and the appetite to invest is very subdued (see the chart below). Our current assumption is that retail sales growth will remain at roughly two-thirds of pre-pandemic levels in 2023.With the Party Congress behind us, will the policy direction shift?
With the Chinese Party Congress now behind us, we are heading into a typically busy time of the year. Key upcoming events to watch include the annual Central Economic Work Conference usually held in December as well as the NPC next March and then the Politburo Economic Meetings held next April and July. These meetings will give an indication of how policies could shift next year. Our base case is that we will see a more conservative policy response – modest monetary policy easing and a more sizable fiscal response (but still neutral, rather than significantly expansionary relative to the state of the economy). While a super-sized stimulus could help to stave off near-term growth challenges, this would cause an increase in leverage in unwelcome places (such as the housing market, or the shadow financing market), at a time when global liquidity is fast contracting due to the historic pace of tightening across the developed world. It will also distract from longer-term goals towards innovation and the green transition. Over the medium-term, the Party Congress also reinforced existing policy goals of national security and self-sufficiency.
In our view, there is scope for some regulatory loosening after the rush to implement major regulatory changes over the last two years. In other words, we think policymakers would figure out a way to maintain the current run-rate of GDP growth at around 3% year-over-year, and protect financial stability, but not much more beyond that as they try to re-orient the economic growth model away from the property sector and towards innovation and the green transition.
The combination of a housing slowdown and subdued consumption appetite presents a challenging growth backdrop in 2023. In addition, we think global demand – particularly for manufactured household goods – could weaken in 2023 as both the U.S. and Eurozone could be in a recession this time next year. Against this global economic and financial market backdrop, the policy trade-off for 2023 would be tougher than usual.All market and economic data as of October 27, 2022 and sourced from Bloomberg Finance L.P. and FactSet unless otherwise stated.

The situation in the United Kingdom has dominated market narratives lately. Policy confusion continued to roil markets after the Bank of England (BoE) denied that the emergency bond buying would be extended into next week as conditions in the UK Gilt market “seemed calmer”. However, the Financial Times later reported that the BoE was privately assuring market participants that it might extend bond buying if needed. Despite the chaos, Prime Minister Liz Truss reiterated that she ""absolutely"" won’t cut public spending, shrugging off warnings of a £60 billion black hole in public finances. A rare divergence took place in rates and FX, where we saw a two standard deviation move in both the Pound and Gilt yields (in different directions), which was last seen in 2016 (Brexit) and 2009 (the Global Financial Crisis). Market concerns were further spooked by reports of a fire-sale of assets by pension funds. We think this could be a key driver of the recent price actions from long-end Gilts and inflation-linked bonds to other developed market bonds. Uncertainties may remain elevated for UK and GBP assets for longer, as it takes time for foreign investors – who the UK relies on to fund its external and public deficits – to rebuild confidence in UK policymakers. We expect the GBP to remain vulnerable until the broader macro backdrop of a hawkish Fed and weak global growth environment looks more constructive.
Markets were also eagerly anticipating the September CPI report this week. Inflation continued to surge, with core CPI hitting a 40-year high. Based on the projections released at the September FOMC meeting, the Fed will likely continue to push ahead with aggressive rate hikes. We still expect around 125 bps hike for the rest of this year – with the terminal rate reaching 4.3%.
Strategy Question: Given the challenging backdrop, what are our current thoughts on U.S. equities?
Our S&P 500 base case now anticipates
a mild recession
to occur sometime in mid-2023. Over the next one to two quarters, we expect that the environment will remain complicated for U.S. equities, which are facing a) earnings estimates for 2023 that are simply too high, b) price/earnings multiples that will likely remain pressured by higher interest rates, and c) a hawkish Federal Reserve that is committed to dampening inflation. We’re also facing a lack of conviction as to when inflation will be brought down, and how much economic pain will need to bring it down. However, on a 12-month view, these issues confronting equities are likely to be resolved, or at least offer greater clarity to investors. Taking into account all these factors, our 2022 year-end S&P 500 outlook has been lowered to 3,450-3,550, and a September 2023 outlook set at 3,950-4,050. This is represented by the light blue line below. We aim to address our key assumptions in this report.How much downside do we expect for 2023 consensus earnings?
While 2023 consensus earnings estimates have declined from $252 to $242 in the last few months, this is still ~13% higher than our revised estimate of $210. We expect that 2023 consensus earnings estimates will be revised lower in the coming months, but this will likely only fall to ~$230 by the end of 2022. Another round of earnings downgrades are likely to take place in the first quarter of 2023 when companies report their 2022 results and offer initial guidance for the year ahead. After this occurs and earnings estimates become more realistic, the equity market will likely have a better chance of finding a solid bottom – probably in the latter part of 1Q23. Until then, U.S. equity markets are likely to stay volatile.
What P/E multiples are we assuming?
Broadly speaking, we view the level of P/E multiples as a function of the earnings growth (and sustainability) outlook, the level of the 10-year treasury yield, and a variable risk premium to account for the degree of economic uncertainty. For our base case year-end outlook of 3,450-3,550, we set the P/E multiple at 16.5x, the 25-year average for the S&P 500 index. We believe this is consistent with our outlook for the 10-year treasury yield to decline back to 3.4%, which is coincidentally also the 25-year average for the 10-year treasury yield. Given the uncertainty regarding the earnings outlook, we believe it is prudent to apply this multiple to our near trough earnings estimate for 2023 of $210 in setting our 2022 year-end outlook.
However, a year from now, we expect that the economy will be in a mild recession, visibility towards an S&P 500 earnings bottom will likely have improved, and investors will increasingly look towards the next cycle. Equity markets typically rebound around 3 months before the end of a recession. It is also common for P/E multiples to expand at the beginning of a new cycle to factor in earnings that are below normalized levels, and lowered 10-year interest rates to occur due to weaker growth. We set our P/E multiple at 18.5x for our 1-year S&P 500 outlook in order to factor in the bottoming of earnings, and a 10-year yield we expect to decline to around 2.5% by September 2023.
How does our mild recession compare to the average recession?
We believe it is illustrative to compare how our mild recession assumptions compare to prior historical recessions. The yardsticks we use to measure against include  a) the average peak-to-trough earnings decline during recessions, b) the average peak-to-trough equity market price decline during recessions, and c) the average duration of equity market peak-to-trough during recessions.
Starting with earnings, we are assuming a -10% YoY earnings decline over the 2H23 to 1H24 period, which compares to a median earnings decline of 14% during the last 12 recessions. Our assumption is that slightly higher inflation (positive for revenues) and much larger tech sector (higher margins) leads to a more moderate earnings decline in this cycle. In addition, the average peak-to-trough S&P 500 price decline is 31% during recessionary episodes compared to the current -25% drawdown thus far, and the duration of these pullbacks is ~300 trading days versus the current ~200 days in the current cycle. Thus, our base case that the current bear market in U.S. equities could end sometime in the next one to two quarters is consistent with an average U.S. recession.What if we are wrong?
While the most likely scenario in our view is a mild recession, it is possible that the US economy deteriorates more than we expect, particularly if inflation remains stubbornly high and the Fed needs to raise rates materially above current market pricing at the expense of more economic damage to the economy. This scenario is characterized by a further 5-6% decline in our base-case earnings estimate, and a lower for longer P/E multiple assumption to factor in a more prolonged earnings recovery as highlighted in the orange line above. We assess this scenario as a 15% probability of occurring. Likewise, if the Fed is able to engineer a soft landing by moderating inflation while not slowing the US economy too much, our bull case (dark blue line) would apply.
What does it mean for investors?
This tricky macro backdrop calls for an increase in quality in equity portfolios. We define this as companies and sectors that have strong balance sheets, pricing power, high margins, relatively predictable and non-cyclical end-demand, and attractive valuations. By far our most favored sector at this juncture remains Healthcare, which is trading at a discount to its own history, versus low-risk sectors like staples, and has low cyclicality of demand. Sub-sectors within Industrials such as defense and agricultural machinery companies also offer resilience. Finally, we believe that reasonably priced software companies, and some Fintech companies within the Technology sector are starting to offer value for longer term investors.
Last but not least, volatility is also likely to stay elevated, and structured notes are offering particularly attractive and compelling opportunities.All market and economic data as of October 14, 2022 and sourced from Bloomberg Finance L.P. and FactSet unless otherwise stated.

Global equities had a strong week. The S&P 500 staged a 6% rally on the first two trading days, before stabilizing on Wednesday. 10-year US treasury yields fell to around the 3.75% level. It can be tricky to apply a narrative to short-term price actions, but to us there are two main drivers behind this movement. First, while global central banks are not yet ready to change course, the market started to price in the possibility that we’re getting closer to an inflection point. This was based on a few signals. On Tuesday, the Reserve Bank of Australia opted for just a 25 bps rate hike, when the market had expected 50 bps. The United Nations also called on the Fed to stop raising rates because it was deemed that this action was increasing risk to more vulnerable emerging economies. Second, a few recent data points in the US have shown a slowdown in both growth and demand for labor, which supports the idea that Fed tightening is so far having its intended impact. The ISM Manufacturing survey released on Monday suggested that both employment and new order growth was negative in September, and the latest job openings data showed the largest monthly decline since the onset of the pandemic. In our view, equities could remain choppy in the months ahead due to earnings downgrade risks, and we continue to favor participating in the market via structures rather than cash buying.
Commodities are back to the center of the stage. After their meeting on Wednesday, the OPEC+ agreed to collectively cut output by two million barrels a day, starting from November, on concerns over a global demand slowdown. WTI crude oil has rallied +8% so far this week, trading around $88/barrel. We expect a moderate rise in oil over the next 12 months (1-year outlook for WTI at $93 and Brent at $98
1
) taking into account persistently tight supply and a global growth downturn. Structured notes on the commodity with deep buffers look particularly attractive to us.
Despite the rally in risk assets, there are clear indications of macro environment deterioration. Our base case now expects a shallow US recession to begin around mid-year 2023. Read on to understand our thinking on this view, and the implications it may have for your portfolio.
Strategy question: Why is a US recession now the base case?
For some time we have been highlighting that the window for a soft landing of the US economy was narrowing – and a recession starting around mid-2023 has now become our base case. Over the past few months, inflation has become stickier than we thought it would be, which means that the risk of the Fed doing too much (i.e. tightening more than necessary and tipping the economy into recession) has risen to a point where we now think it is more probable than not that a recession unfolds within the next year. We still think it might be possible for the Fed to engineer a soft landing – we just think it’s less likely.
While recent data suggested that the US economy is still resilient, the Fed’s September update to their economic projections suggest a recession could be on the horizon:
The Fed projects core inflation (ex-food and energy) to be at 3.1% by year-end 2023. That’s a move in the right direction, but still too far above their long-term target. The risk is that as a result, long-term inflation expectations become entrenched, making it very difficult for the Fed to bring inflation down, and it will likely need to keep restrictive policies for longer. While we expect core inflation to start coming down in the coming quarter or two as the supply side of the economy continues to heal, the Fed can’t back off until it does.
The Fed projects a “slight” rise in the unemployment rate from 3.7% today to 4.4% by year-end 2023. However, since 1971, every time unemployment rose by more than 0.5%, it ended up rising by an average of 2.8% thereafter. That’s what a hard landing would look like. Taking a closer look at every instance when the unemployment rate went up in the past +70 years, we found that an increase of 2% or more in the unemployment rate preceded a recession every time. That said, note that the stock market had a tendency to bottom before unemployment reached its peak (see the chart below).
We now expect the Fed to hike to a terminal rate of around 4.6% in February 2023, which will likely induce a monetary policy-driven recession around mid-year 2023. We continue to view a financial crisis recession as unlikely, as Dodd Frank regulations solidified bank balance sheets and pushed riskier lending outside the banking sector. That said, credit availability may deteriorate, and financial stability may become more challenged as the macro environment deteriorates.What does it mean for our cross-asset views?
One of our highest conviction ideas continues to be core fixed income –
where investors can now get equity-like returns. While recently the mark to market impact of holding bonds has been painful, core fixed income has the luxury of delivering coupon payments to offset the mark to market impact of higher yields. For those thinking about buying core fixed income, but have preferred cash or cash equivalents so far, consider reinvestment risk. Elevated front-end rates are unlikely to last as the economic outlook deteriorates. Over the last 65 years, recessions have prompted the Fed to cut rates by an average of three percentage points in the year after the recession.
For high-yield credits, we have started to see the impact of tighter policy. New debt issuance has declined by 77% so far this year, and high-yield issuance has already slowed to just 0.5% of the overall high-yield market size. Looking at all instances when this has occurred since the GFC, it has typically led to 12-month forward default rates of 4.2%. We do not think that markets are compensating investors sufficiently for the risk of a default cycle. In fact, while the S&P 500 is currently pricing in 86% of the average recessionary drawdown, U.S. high-yield credit is still only at 49%. We expect spreads to widen to ~720bps by year-end.For U.S. equities, we expect a choppy market as economic uncertainty and negative revisions work through equity markets. We reduce our estimates for 2022 and 2023. Earnings will likely continue to be revised down in the coming quarters, but we don’t expect a collapse. Our outlook for year-end 2022 is $3,500-3,600, while we project $3,950-4,050 in 12 months. We are now buyers of S&P 500 dips. We view 3,500 as the optimal S&P 500 level to start legging in, but the index could fall to around 3,200 if our bear case emerges. Our defensive approach has not changed our sector and factor preferences. Investors should emphasize a combination of quality and reasonably-priced secular and defensive growth, funded by a lower weighting in cyclical stocks.
In the FX space, the dollar strength is in focus. The “safe-haven effect” coupled with a higher carry comes into play here. While interest rate differentials and mean reversion tend to drive the dollar over the longer-term, global growth dynamics have been dominating the narrative as of late. As countries across the globe have transitioned towards an economic slowdown (and possibly recession), investors have sought shelter in more stable assets. Hence, the U.S. dollar has appreciated relative to other currencies deemed to be less stable. We expect some of the risk premium priced into USD to recede over the medium-term, but not before we get some combination of i) greenshoots in the global economy and ii) cooling inflation in the US, which allows the Fed to pivot from its ultra-hawkish stance.

The last few weeks have seen moves in markets and policy that haven’t been witnessed in decades.  The Federal Reserve and other global central banks tightened, and in a more synchronous fashion, than has been seen in decades. These policies are necessary to contain inflationary pressure even if they risk an increasingly certain recession; and they are happening quickly, in an uncoordinated manner, and in larger magnitude than markets expected. As a result, markets are rapidly repricing what this means, both in terms of the growth slowdown, as well as liquidity and financial conditions, with most major moves playing out through FX and rates markets. In the backdrop, the world is still emerging from Covid, a war is ongoing in Europe (with ever present risks of escalation), supply chains are shifting, and major economies are facing weaker growth. Is this the start of something worse? Are gyrations in the UK the canary in the coal mine of a larger crisis, or is this an orderly repricing as stimulus is unwound and the global economy slows?
FX markets: the dollar climbs higher, the pound falters
To ecap how extreme some of these moves are: the dollar is at a multi-decades high, having last seen these levels over 20 years ago. When viewed relative to its long-run average it’s clear how stretched current dollar valuations are (see chart). As a result of this dollar strength, the Renminbi, Euro, Yen, and Sterling are also at levels not seen in decades.The UK stands out as an extreme example. The Pound is at levels last seen in the mid-1980s and is facing further downside pressure. Meanwhile UK interest rates are rising as concern builds around future inflation and debt sustainability. The catalyst was the fiscal stimulus program launched by the new government, but the underlying stress stems from structural factors including the fact that the UK runs one of the largest current account deficits of among major economies. This is compounded by high levels of inflation and a growing fiscal deficit. In order to fund its fiscal deficit it will need to attract capital and to attract capital the currency needs to cheapen and rates need to be attractive. As the country attempts to spend its way out of high inflation in an effort to avoid a recession, the market is showing its disagreement and pricing inflation remain persistently high. To stabilize the financial market, the Bank of England (BOE) on Wednesday stepped into the market to buy long-dated government bonds. Looking ahead, the BOE will likely hike further to contain inflation, but this highlights just how uncoordinated policy currently is.Perhaps as a sign of the times, Japan is also following this path of uncoordinated policy with the Finance Ministry spending to support the currency (in fact spending more than all of 1998) while the Bank of Japan is reaffirming its easy policy stance in effect weakening the currency. The Renminbi has also been receiving attention for weakening to above 7.2 against the dollar, a level not seen since 2008, despite a trade surplus that is at historical high. As an example of how this is largely about dollar strength rather than idiosyncratic country-specific stories (except the GBP), the CNH is at a multi-year low against the dollar but is still strong in trade-weighted terms. In terms of overall direction, we think the dollar could continue to strengthen, or at a minimum remain at elevated levels for some time. In our view the two factors that could cause a reversal are a Fed pivot or a resurgence in global growth, and we give neither of these a high near-term probability. As a result, the dollar could continue its rise against most major currencies. The implications of this are twofold: it exacerbates the inflation problem around the world as countries experience costlier imports, and it makes USD debt more expensive to service, thereby creating risks for emerging markets.
The Fed and equity markets
Broad markets have continued to take a beating. A 60/40 equity-fixed income portfolio is seeing one of the largest selloffs since the GFC, as both equities and bonds sell off on higher yields and weaker growth expectations. The key factor is a re-pricing of Fed rate hike expectations, which has been dramatic over the last couple of weeks. We first saw the hawkish Jackson Hole speech, then an above-consensus surprise in inflation, followed by a hawkish FOMC meeting. As a result yields moved significantly higher across the curve and real yields (nominal yield minus inflation) have climbed higher. The other key factor is the pace of hiking. The current rate hiking cycle is the fastest since Volker in 1980 in terms of extra basis points added in this period of time. While the absolute level of rates is still modest in historic terms, the pace of change matters more for markets.The hawkish narratives from the Fed will likely place further downward pressure on the US equity markets. Firstly, the slowdown in economic activity is associated with a more aggressive path for rate hikes and a higher-for-longer level of interest rates will likely lead to earnings downside risks in 2023 and beyond. Consensus earnings estimates are currently too high and need to be revised lower, and a stronger USD is an additional headwind to US corporate earnings. In addition, higher for longer interest rates and tighter financial conditions negatively impact the price, or equity multiple, that investors are willing to pay to own equities. With mild recession risks rising, earnings downsides skew, and multiple compression. Uncertainty is likely at its highest in the coming months likely keeping US equity markets capped near current levels. As earnings estimates adjust lower, valuations reset, and clarity over the path forward for inflation improves, investors will increasingly be able to look towards the next cycle as we head through 2023.Rising uncertainty in Europe
European markets contended with the recent news that two leaks had been reported in the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. While Russia has stopped flows via the pipeline earlier, the leaks further damaged hopes that flows will be resumed over the winter. This pushed European natural gas prices back up +20% to €208/MWh after falling from over €330/MWh to €170/MWh over the last month. Crude oil also jumped more than +3% at one point yesterday following headlines that Russia would propose at 1mbd cut to OPEC supply, which would tip the crude market into a deficit. We see higher probability of energy rationing over winter on the event, and the situation is also posting upside risks to global inflation. Our base case is a mild recession in Europe due to the deepening energy crisis.
In other news, Italy held elections which sent a right-wing alliance led by Giorgia Meloni’s Brothers of Italy party into power. Her coalition partners have called for additional fiscal support, adding further market uncertainty around Italy’s already-strained public finances. This might create another layer of downside risks for the Euro.
For investors, the key implication is that we remain cautious on European assets in general at this time despite their record-low valuations, with the exception of select energy names. And although EURUSD is now just above our year-end target at 0.95 (midpoint of the range 0.93-0.97), the risks still look skewed to the downside in the near-term.All market and economic data as of September 29, 2022 and sourced from Bloomberg Finance L.P. and FactSet unless otherwise stated.

After weeks of bearish market sentiment, U.S. equities had its biggest bounce in about a month on Wednesday. Bonds also rallied with yields across the curve falling from highs. Easing Fed narratives seemed to help, as the latest Beige Book published by the Fed discussed softening inflation pressures across regions in the U.S., and Fed Vice Chair Brainard released a speech in which she hinted at the risk of raising interest rates too far. That said, we’ve seen that before, and market expectations of the Fed’s policy path could shift quickly on another speech or data release. The overall macro backdrop still remains highly uncertain for equities, and we encourage investors to
manage their equity exposures
with caution.
The energy shortage is back in focus. On Monday, European gas futures surged an astounding +15% in response to Russia’s Gazprom shutting down the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline indefinitely. Despite reports that the EU should meet its gas storage target two months sooner than planned, supply remains constrained and the rationing risk is still very real. The EUR and GBP both hit new lows, reaching below 0.99 and 1.15 respectively. This was followed by the news that the OPEC+ agreed to a 100kbpd cut to supply and left the door open for further cuts to “stabilize volatile markets"". Oil nevertheless tumbled on Wednesday to around $82/barrel on fears of a demand crunch due to extended lockdowns in China.  In other news, USD-JPY broke the critical 140 level on reports that the government is considering cash handouts to households in order to fight inflation. The broad weakness across non-USD currencies takes us to today’s strategy question…
Strategy Question: When will the USD peak?
The dollar has been thriving since the start of the year. While much attention has been paid to the dramatic decline in the GBP and EUR, citing factors such as high gas prices or stagflation, the U.S. dollar has been the key driving force. For example, the GBP has fallen -3.8% against the USD since July 6, but it is down only -0.6% against the EUR, -0.7% against the JPY and -0.4% against the RMB.  The broad dollar (DXY) index rallied 15% year-to-date putting it at a 20-year high. Another way to look at it is through real exchange rates. The chart below compares real trade-weighted exchange rates with their averages over the past 30 years, and shows that the USD is now more “expensive” than at any time in recent decades.The dollar rally earlier this year was largely driven by widening interest rate differentials that attracted yield-seeking flows. The rapid hawkish pivot of the Federal Reserve brought USD yields across the curve sharply higher, particularly the short-end (i.e. the 2-year U.S. Treasury yield spiked 270 bps since the start of the year). Other major central banks were either slower in the tightening moves, or remain accommodative, prioritizing other growth challenges.
However, it is difficult to say this is the primary cause of recent strength, as rising interest rates don’t tell the whole story. 10-year rates in the UK have risen almost 60bps more than in the U.S., and the 10-year spread between German and U.S. rates is almost exactly the same as it was two months ago. U.S. 2-year spreads have actually narrowed by -20bps against Germany and by -85bps against the UK. Why then has the dollar risen so strongly?
One potential explanation, particularly for Europe and other energy importers such as Japan, is that sharply higher energy prices have shifted the terms of trade, eliminating trade surpluses. This could also explain why commodity exporting currencies have held steady. But even in this respect Norway, whose currency has been steady against the USD this summer, has still depreciated by -10% since the Ukraine war started, despite the vast gains in its terms of trade.
Another explanation could be that dollar strength is becoming more correlated with global growth downgrades and that we are simply at one extreme end of the “dollar smile”. To see the dollar weaken from here we would need to see some of these factors reverse. But before we look specifically at what (if anything) might turn the dollar, we’ll take a look at where we think other major currencies are headed.EUR and GBP: winter is coming
The British and European currencies have moved sharply lower on growth and balance of payments challenges. Growth across the continent continued to be revised lower on severe energy shortages and soaring inflation. UK headline CPI hit a high of 10.1% in July, while the print for the Eurozone also hit a record 9.1% with energy prices 38% higher than last year. Seeing little sign of inflation peaking from here, economists have become increasingly concerned about a painful stagflationary recession around the corner. In addition, to avoid energy rationing over the winter, European economies have had to stock up on expensive LNG from the U.S. and other non-Russian sources, which eroded their trade balances. While the ECB and the BOE are clearly turning more aggressive on policy tightening, this has done little to lift their currencies. The UK is also facing specific issues that create the potential for further downside, most notably post-Brexit trade arrangements and the potential for expansive fiscal policy. In the near-term we think both currencies could depreciate against the dollar. Over the longer-term there could be some mean reversion, particularly for the EUR, but the forces pushing these currencies weaker against the dollar are unlikely to abate soon.CNH: housing downturn and policy easing in focus
We have been bearish on the Chinese Yuan (CNH) since early this year, and continue to see the currency weaken against the dollar into year-end. A deep housing downturn and a confidence crisis induced by lingering Covid uncertainties have led to our below-consensus view on growth this year and the next. While strong exports and a strong balance of payments have been a key support for the CNH, as growth across developed economies decelerates, that strength could fade over time and indeed may have already started to fade as evidenced by this week’s trade data. In addition, capital outflows have started to pick up. Interestingly, capital flows tend to be well correlated to property prices; with prices now in decline capital outflows could pick up putting further downward pressure on the currency. From an interest rate differential perspective, carry against the USD is now negative. Looking ahead, the People’s Bank of China’s (PBOC) easing bias may create a larger divergence in policy direction with most of the major DM central banks.
We have seen more active intervention from the PBOC lately with stronger-than-expected fixing levels and a cut to the foreign currency reserve requirement ratio (RRR). That said, the interventions might be temporary, with the goal of creating two-way volatility over the short term, instead of reversing the path of depreciation. The PBOC may be less incentivized to strongly defend the currency given economic growth challenges and the fact that the currency has been stable against currencies of major trading partners other than the U.S. However, the RMB’s decline against the dollar is unlikely to stop. The fundamental issue is that the monetary policy trajectories of the U.S. and China are diverging further and this divergence is unlikely to go away anytime soon. China’s policymakers remain reluctant to intervene aggressively in the property market, so the declines in sales and construction activity keep dragging on growth. This means that the PBOC may well cut policy rates further this year.
If the USD keeps rising against other major currencies, USD-CNH is very likely to weaken past 7.0. Such a development may not cause the PBOC to abandon its relatively hands-off approach to the exchange rate. Tolerating some depreciation allows an automatic adjustment to the historically strong dollar, as PBOC vice governor Liu Guoqiang remarked before the RRR cut. But given that China is already dealing with substantial capital outflows, the PBOC is unlikely to risk a bigger depreciation that would push down the trade-weighted exchange rate. We think USD-CNH may hover around 7.0 into year-end as moves by the PBOC will likely keep weakness in CNH contained in the coming months. Nonetheless we wouldn’t be surprised by seeing the pair break 7 over the medium-term given the fundamental backdrop. We continue to favor short CNH exposure against the USD, particularly for clients looking to hedge existing CNH exposure.JPY: pivot of the BOJ easing not yet on the horizon
The JPY has demonstrated few haven asset characteristics this year. This week marked another freefall of the currency with USD-JPY breaking 140. Central bank divergence is dominating the moves. The BOJ is not showing any signs of backing away from its ultra-easy monetary policies – this week, the central bank said it would increase its buying of JGBs to practice yield curve control. In addition, the government is considering cash handouts to households in response to spiking food and energy prices. It is hard to predict a peak for USD-JPY before we see signs of a BOJ pivot. While further upside to the currency pair may be limited from here, we don’t expect the JPY to substantially strengthen from here over the next 6-12 months.Conclusion: A higher and later USD peak
Growth dynamics are in the driver's seat in FX markets at the moment, as is typical in a late-cycle environment. The USD tends to benefit when global growth is under pressure and the outlook of its major trading partners (e.g. Europe and China) continues to look challenging. We believe the USD may continue to see near-term upside and that strength is likely to persist-- and we continue to encourage clients to hedge their non-USD exposures. So what are the risks to this view, and what are we watching for a turning point on dollar strength? First, a less hawkish Fed. The trajectory of the USD in recent months, especially vs G10 currencies, has been closely linked to the U.S. yield curve. If core inflation shifts down more in upcoming readings, it could reignite speculations for a Fed pivot. Second, bottoming global growth. While we think further downward revisions to growth seem likely, if energy prices moderate and/or fiscal stimulus compensates aggressively, a bounce in key leading indicators in the rest of the world could provide some respite. Third, coordinated global intervention, aka a new Plaza Accord. USD strength is starting to cause severe stress around the world so the risk of some sort of coordinated intervention is present. Nonetheless, it remains a low probability event in our opinion given the difficult state of global cooperation.All market and economic data as of September 8, 2022 and sourced from Bloomberg Finance L.P. and FactSet unless otherwise stated.

A hotter than expected CPI print in the U.S. sent both stocks and bonds down this week. On Tuesday, U.S. equities had their worst day since June 2020, with the S&P 500 tumbling -4.3%. Longer duration and interest rate-sensitive sectors led the loss. As we wrote in
a previous note
, equities may remain volatile and further pullbacks are possible as consumer demand continues to be curtailed by elevated inflation and tighter financial conditions, and thus negative revisions to earnings may pick up in the future months. That said, the downward move in equities is keeping volatility high, allowing better pricing on structured notes.
The higher than expected inflation data moved market expectations of the Fed policy path forward. The market started to price in the possibility of a 100bps move in the September FOMC meeting next week, and expectations for the terminal rate spiked to 4.3% in 1Q 2023. One silver lining among the volatile movements was the reaction in the long end of the curve. While short term treasury yields were up meaningfully (the 2-year jumped over 20bps), the move in the 10-year was much smaller; up only a few basis points. This is in line with our view that the long-end yields will likely be relatively anchored from here while the short-end ones continue to react sensitively to inflation evolutions and Fed communications.
In FX, the dollar index further spiked to 109, strengthening against almost all the major currencies. Last week we talked about
a higher and later USD peak
– and we believe that the USD may continue to see near-term upside until core inflation clearly shifts down in upcoming readings, or growth in the rest of the world bottoms. Investors shall consider hedging their non-USD exposures.
Strategy Question: How to position as inflation risks persist?
The U.S. CPI data clearly dampened complacent expectations that inflation is on a path to trend down smoothly. Headline prices rose +0.1% month-over-month in August, bringing the year-over-year figure to +8.3% (vs. consensus estimates of +8.1%, prior +8.5%). The core measure, which strips out the volatile food and energy prices, popped +0.6% compared with the previous month, doubling the consensus estimates.Taking a closer look, shelter inflation was responsible for half of the rise in core inflation. Both rent and owners’ equivalent rent (OER) increased a strong 0.7% month-over-month. This is a sticky component of inflation, which has not been welcomed by the Fed. The message from non-shelter services is a bit mixed, with medical care services and transportation accelerating, but recreation coming in flat over the month. We were optimistic that goods inflation was on the path of cooling as consumers shift spending to services, but that hasn’t seemed to play out. The price of goods increased 0.5% month-on month, within which the price of new vehicles was up 0.8%, offsetting the slight decline in used vehicles – with a possible reason being that consumer spending got support from the fall in gasoline prices.We have been clear about the
risks of sticky inflation
, as it becomes evident inflation was broadening beyond reopening categories and the labor market remained far too tight. This data print bears that out. Interestingly, as oil prices come down this could actually make the environment more challenging for the Fed. Lower fuel prices increase household disposable income and could actually increase spending on goods and services, particularly those in the “core inflation” basket. So even as headline inflation may fall on lower food and fuel prices, core inflation could continue to stay elevated.
Looking at a range of underlying inflation measures shows how intractable this problem has become and why the Fed’s challenge -- and necessary growth sacrifice -- could be more severe than most expect. The following chart shows the median, trimmed mean, sticky, and services inflation rates. These are different ways of measuring inflation that either strips out the noisiest components (trimmed mean), shows the goods where prices are hardest to change (sticky), or service prices, which tend to reflect wages. All of these measures rose. Earlier this year these measures remained largely under control, leading many to think inflation would be transitory. Now they suggest inflation could be a more intractable problem.The Fed will likely hike 75bps at the FOMC meeting next week, with markets also beginning to factor in a probability of a 100bps move.
The continued upward momentum in the more sticky components of the CPI basket also indicates that the central bank may not be able to pivot anytime soon. In our view, the Fed may only consider a dovish pivot when it no longer thinks a restrictive monetary stance is appropriate. We will at least need to see clear softening in the labor market, which is a prerequisite to slower wage increases, slower demand in general, and thus a more persistent downtrend in inflation. In terms of economic growth, navigating that kind of labor market weakness has rarely occurred outside of recessionary environments. The more the Fed has to tighten, the higher the recession risks climbs. From a market perspective, given the persistence in core inflation, and the continued excessive wage inflation, the risk is clearly that either the Fed will likely have to go higher than the market is currently pricing, or stay higher for longer, which in our view is a more likely risk.
This is clearly a tough set of data to digest for investors. However, there are ways to position your portfolios that can provide a buffer in times of uncertainty like this. Here are the top three strategies we’re currently looking towards:
Core bonds may be your defense.
We continue to stress the capital preservation values of core fixed income as the Fed continues to engineer a lower growth environment. Rates across the curve are rising, with 2-year treasuries making new cycle highs. The 10-year bond is back to almost 3.5%, which is a very compelling entry point in our view, especially as recession risks rise. Current levels present the opportunity for high single-digit returns in investment grade corporate bonds, and the portfolio support that core fixed income could provide to portfolios is all the more important given the elevated recession risks.
Take advantage of volatility.
Structures pricing tends to improve when implied volatility spikes. With the VIX index back above 25, income-generating notes (both contingent and static downside barrier notes) provide a way to harvest yield from equity markets without giving up exposure to upside above our base case outlook on the S&P 500 for the next year. Participation notes may also be an interesting option given elevated volatility, providing upside exposure with protection down to supportive valuation levels where we would be cash buyers.
Focus on private investments and real assets.
The private opportunities that we are seeing across the capital structure are still compelling and come with the psychological benefit of not being marked-to-market on a daily basis. Real assets also provide a valuable role for portfolio diversification, income, and inflation protection.All market and economic data as of September 15, 2022 and sourced from Bloomberg Finance L.P. and FactSet unless otherwise stated.

Index definitions:
The
U.S. Dollar Index
(DXY) is an index of the value of the United States dollar relative to a basket of foreign currencies, often referred to as a basket of U.S. trade partners' currencies.
Standard and Poor’s 500 Index
is a capitalization-weighted index of 500 stocks. The index is designed to measure performance of the broad domestic economy through changes in the aggregate market value of 500 stocks representing all major industries. The index was developed with a base level of 10 for the 1941–43 base period.
CBOE Volatility Index (VIX)
is a benchmark index to measure the market’s expectation of future volatility, based on options of the S&P 500 Index.
Past performance is not a guarantee of future returns and investors may get back less than the amount invested. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.
• Callable / Putable Bonds - Callable Bonds have embedded call options which may be exercised by the Issuer, while Putable Bonds have embedded put options which may be exercised by the Investor. These events may result in early unscheduled return of principal on bonds. Investors should note that they may not able to reinvest the amounts received, into other suitable bonds with returns as favorable as that of the pre-existing bonds.
• Perpetual Bonds - Perpetual Bonds have no maturity date and pay a steady stream of interest rate forever. Thus these types of bonds usually have a particularly high duration and are very susceptible to fluctuations in interest rates as compared to normal bonds. Perpetual Bonds generally have lower liquidity and many different technical features. Investors need to exercise caution in dealing with Perpetual Bonds.
• High Yield Bonds - High Yield Bonds (with ratings at or below BB+/Ba1) carry higher risk since they are rated below investment grade, or could be unrated, which implies a higher risk of Issuer default. Further, the risk of rating downgrades is higher for High Yield Bonds in comparison to investment grade bonds.
• Convertible Bonds – Convertible Bonds give the bondholder an option to convert the notional of the bonds into common stock at a predetermined strike price. Hence, under certain circumstances, Convertible Bonds may have a risk profile that closely resembles that of common stock. Investors should note that they are subject to investment risks of both common stock and bonds.
• Contingent Capital / Convertible Bonds - Contingent Convertible Bonds have a contingent write down or loss absorption or conversion feature that allow the bonds to be written off, fully or partially, or converted to other type of assets on the occurrence of a trigger event. Hence, Investors holding Contingent Convertible Bonds are exposed to a higher Issuer credit risk in general and may lose the value of their investment substantially as a result of occurrence of the trigger event.
• Extendable Bonds – Extendable Bonds have extendable maturity dates and Investors would not have a definite schedule of principal repayment.
• Variable-Rate Bonds – Variable-Rate Bonds have variable and/or deferral of interest payment terms and Investors would face uncertainty over the amount and time of the interest payments to be received.
• Subordinated Bonds – Subordinated Bonds have subordinated ranking and in the event of liquidation or insolvency of the Issuer, Investors would only be entitled to be paid after other senior creditors are paid.
General/Macro Reference only
• Investing in alternative assets involves higher risks than traditional investments and is suitable only for sophisticated investors. Alternative investments involve greater risks than traditional investments and should not be deemed a complete investment program. They are generally not tax efficient and an investor should consult with his/her tax advisor prior to investing. Alternative investments have higher fees than traditional investments and they may also be highly leveraged and engage in speculative investment techniques, which can magnify the potential for investment loss or gain. The value of the investment may fall as well as rise and investors may get back less than they invested.
Real Estate/Hedge Funds/Other Private Investments
• Real estate, hedge funds, and other private investments may not be suitable for all individual investors, may present significant risks, and may be sold or redeemed at more or less than the original amount invested. Private investments are offered only by offering memoranda, which more fully describe the possible risks. There are no assurances that the stated investment objectives of any investment product will be met. Hedge funds (or funds of hedge funds): often engage in leveraging and other speculative investment practices that may increase the risk of investment loss; can be highly illiquid; are not required to provide periodic pricing or valuation information to investors; may involve complex tax structures and delays in distributing important tax information; are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as mutual funds; and often charge high fees. Further, any number of conflicts of interest may exist in the context of the management and/or operation of any hedge fund.
Structured product involves derivatives. Do not invest in it unless you fully understand and are willing to assume the risks associated with it.  The most common risks include, but are not limited to, risk of adverse or unanticipated market developments, issuer credit quality risk, risk of lack of uniform standard pricing, risk of adverse events involving any underlying reference obligations, risk of high volatility, risk of illiquidity/little to no secondary market, and conflicts of interest. Before investing in a structured product, investors should review the accompanying offering document, prospectus or prospectus supplement to understand the actual terms and key risks associated with the each individual structured product. Any payments on a structured product are subject to the credit risk of the issuer and/or guarantor. Investors may lose their entire investment, i.e., incur an unlimited loss. The risks listed above are not complete. For a more comprehensive list of the risks involved with this particular product, please speak to your J.P. Morgan representative. If you are in any doubt about the risks involved in the product, you may clarify with the intermediary or seek independent professional advice.
