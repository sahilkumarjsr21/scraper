A growing number of endowments, foundations and families are recognizing the value of using outside resources to help them meet their goals. They can select the resources suitable to their needs and still maintain control. This worldwide shift toward outsourcing is a by-product of the ever-increasing complexity of global markets. It also signals a growing awareness among organizations that more successful portfolio management requires more sophisticated tools and resources, as well as more timely decision making. Working with an OCIO has enabled investment committees to better focus on policy, strategy and other key issues— and it doesn’t mean loss of control. Organizations retain the ability to choose investment managers, determine their level of discretion and set investment guidelines. Through J.P. Morgan’s Outsourced chief investment office, endowments, foundations and families can work closely with seasoned practitioners, and can access a comprehensive range of portfolio management services tailored to their own specific objectives.Partnership is key to success
As a committed partner, we are here to create a sound investment plan with your committee that will help your organization grow and flourish. We believe that ongoing communication is crucial to any relationship, and we will work with you to develop a plan of ongoing dialogue that suits your needs.Access to philanthropic experience

Sometimes liquidity needs arise, whether they’re planned or unexpected. With a securities-backed line of credit in place, you’ll have ready access to capital without having to liquidate your investments. You can use your marketable securities, such as stocks, bonds and mutual funds, as collateral. And of course, we’ll consider how it all fits into your overall wealth plan—balancing your short-term needs with long-term goals to create the right approach for you.What is securities-based lending?
A securities-based line of credit can be a flexible and cost-effective way to access liquidity strategically. Whether you are looking to fund a new purchase, renovate your home or take advantage of a timely investment opportunity. Using a line of credit allows you to remain invested and keep your investment portfolio intact.
Other common uses include:
Real estate purchase
Expenses such as taxes
Specialty assets such as yacht, art, or stadium financesBenefits that can make a securities-based line of credit a valuable complement to your investment portfolio:
Stay invested.
Keep your investment plan and asset allocation in place without disrupting your long-term strategy
Financial flexibility
. Quickly access liquidity for a range of uses—whether you’re meeting large financial obligations or seizing an opportunity
Cost-effective.
There are no setup fees, and only the funds you use incur interest charges, which are often lower than other financing options.
Potentially tax-efficient.
A securities-based line of credit can potentially be structured in a tax-efficient way, which may allow you to more effectively grow and preserve your wealth.
As with all investment decisions, it’s important to understand the risks of borrowing before moving forward. Events beyond your control, like market fluctuations that may reduce the value of your pledged securities, could lead to a margin call. We’re here to help you make the best decisions for your needs. Today and in the future.
How does it work?
As a client, you have the ability to borrow the sum total of the Lending Value of the securities in your account. A Lending Value is a percentage of each security’s market value and represents how much J.P. Morgan is willing to lend against the asset. Lending Values are subject to change without notice.
There are two types of Lending Value:
Initial Lending Value (ILV) is the maximum amount that could be borrowed against your portfolio. ILV determines how much you can draw from your line, and whether collateral can be released or substituted.
When there is no release or substitution of collateral, Maintenance Lending Value (MLV) determines how much equity you are required to hold in your portfolio. Therefore, market depreciation may not cause an immediate margin call. A security’s MLV is typically higher than its ILV. MLVs are set at J.P. Morgan’s discretion up to regulatory thresholds.",,"

Being aware of your choices and thoughtful when considering your compensation plan can be extremely important. That’s true whether you are looking to optimize your own executive compensation plan, or packages for those who work for you. From reviewing employment agreements and evaluating stock options, to deciding among retirement benefit plans, we have the knowledge and experience to advise you. Count on us to ask the right questions.Work with us to develop a clear view of the landscape for compensation, and tax implications of different plans, awards and options. Consider the basics:Compensation types
Many of our clients receive annual equity awards as part of their executive compensation plan (RSUs, ISOs, phantom stock). And the range of retirement plans and benefits can be immense—qualified pensions, non-qualified pensions, 401(k)s, executive retirement plans and more.
Knowing their tax implications is key, as is understanding when and how they’ll pay out. Our J.P. Morgan teams can guide you and your employees, if relevant, through these awards and benefits and ensure that you have sound strategies in place.Attracting and retaining talent
It’s important to be thoughtful with implementing your compensation program and ensure it encourages behavior that will drive your business forward. Some employers focus on keeping employees for the long term, while others reward employees based on company performance. How your company is structured (C Corp, S Corp, LLC) can be a key consideration in these decisions. Additionally, many employers in both the private and public sectors like to consider having a performance metric tied to the award payout (e.g., EBITDA).
Our team is here and ready to work with you as you consider your own compensation structure as well as what types of awards may make the most sense for your business.Managing your concentrated wealth

When the bulk of your wealth is tied to a concentrated stock position, whether you own a business or you work for a large public company, it’s important to think about how this affects your personal wealth and objectives.For a business owner or corporate executive to build a smart, risk-managed, personal investment portfolio, they must take into account their core asset: their company.
Steve Faulkner, Head of Private Business AdvisoryFor a business owner or corporate executive to build a smart, risk-managed, personal investment portfolio, they must take into account their core asset: their company.Steve Faulkner, Head of Private Business AdvisoryFinding a balance between staying invested in your company or its stock and reaching your goals can be tricky. There are three things you should consider as you review your plan.
Get clear on your big picture:
First and foremost, it is essential that you know what you want your wealth to accomplish. Is there a certain lifestyle you would like to maintain now and/or in retirement? Are you supporting family? Do you hope to pass wealth on to loved ones? Do you give regularly to charities? Different structures or strategies can help jump-start or fulfill such goals.
Think through your wealth options:
What you can do with concentrated position may be shaped by how you received the shares or your relationship with the company that issued the shares. For example, if you’re a company insider, there may be restrictions on your selling. Or maybe the constraints are more emotional than legal—you may feel a sense of loyalty to your employer (public or private) and therefore an obligation to stay concentrated even when it isn’t required.
Evaluate your situation:
You want to be sure to evaluate your current situation. Do you have liquidity needs or can you afford to keep the stock? How much do you need or want to use the funds for something else? Is there some other investment opportunity you would like to fund? Are you tax or cost sensitive?
Whatever your situation, we can help you understand your choices to enhance wealth diversification and find an approach that works for you.Additional Services

When it comes to making long-term financial plans, every family has unique needs— empowering the next generation to be responsible stewards; creating a thorough succession plan for your investments and other assets; or, for larger and more complex wealth portfolios, setting up a family office. However you envision the future of your wealth, we can help prepare you and your family for what’s next.Family wealth stewardship
Getting your whole family on the same page when it comes to money is often difficult. You want them to understand the responsibilities of wealth, and their part in helping manage and preserve it. We can help guide you and your family as you share and shape that vision together. We know the ins and outs of family wealth management, and we’ve helped generations of families like yours protect their wealth—as well as their most important values.
Family wealth management is more than investments and assets. It’s also relationships, and the shared memories, culture and values that go with them. Wealth can help cultivate and enrich these relationships, but it can also complicate them. Our J.P. Morgan teams help you start the conversation about resources, objectives and values. And then help you create a clear roadmap toward working together to preserve, protect and pass on your wealth.Succession planning for family wealth
We believe that sharing your wealth with your family should be considered in the context of the vision you have for your wealth. Your long-term goals and concerns, and those of your family. Whether you’re passing down a business, investments or property, we have experience advising families on both the emotional and technical elements of wealth succession planning.
Let your values be your guide. Before you formalize a succession strategy in an estate plan, determine how you want your vision to shape the way you share and manage your family wealth, now and for future generations. We can help you create a family wealth governance framework that builds consensus around your values and objectives, sets important boundaries, helps guide decision-making and mitigate conflicts.Family office advisory
Family offices can offer many benefits, but they also come with costs and challenges. Whether you’re considering setting up a new entity or already have one, J.P. Morgan can provide the capabilities and advice designed to meet your unique needs. We help families weigh options and make sound decisions, including selecting the right structure. Selecting and compensating staff. Determining family involvement. And fine-tuning operations so that the office truly functions in service of your values and objectives.
There are a number of family office structures, and each carries advantages and challenges. We can help you choose the best structure for your needs.
A

gives you maximum control and privacy, but also carries the highest costs and administrative responsibilities.
A
multi-family office

Our tax-smart strategies can help you achieve potentially higher after-tax returns, while tailoring your portfolio to make it uniquely yours.It’s not what you earn, but what you keep that matters.Seeing stocks you own drop in value is never easy, but there is an upside to market downturns. It’s called “tax loss harvesting,” and it can put stock losses to work for you.
At its simplest, tax loss harvesting is a strategy designed to help reduce your overall tax liability, so you can keep more of what you earn. It works by extracting tax benefits from selling investments at a loss – which can be used to offset capital gains realized elsewhere in your portfolio. When applied effectively, tax loss harvesting may result in enhanced after-tax returns.How can tax loss harvesting help generate after-tax returns?Why Tax-Smart Strategies with J.P.

What is tax-loss harvesting?
Simply put, tax loss harvesting is the timely selling of securities at a loss to offset realized investment gains elsewhere in your portfolio. This provides an opportunity to lower your tax bill, allowing you to keep more of your returns.
What personalization options are available for my portfolio?
We offer a variety of ways to customize your portfolio to your individual preferences.  We have over 40 screens for concentrated stock / industry exposure or values.
What is the minimum investment?
The minimum investment will depend on the strategy that you choose. For example, we offer minimums as low $250,000 where you can personalize your S&P 500 exposure.
What if I have appreciated holdings?
For investors looking to fund their portfolio with securities, we offer flexible transition options that are customized to their individual tax budget preferences. We’ll partner closely with you to design a portfolio that aligns with your wealth goals and preferences, while enhancing your after-tax return potential. You can also transition your existing holdings into a tax-efficient manner that’s cognizant of your unique tax budget preferences.
How will I know how my portfolio is performing?
Our robust performance reporting quantifies your tax benefit relative to the benchmark, helping you to easily understand the value-add of our active tax management.
What are the potential risks of a tax loss harvesting strategy?
Tracking error is one potential risk of a tax loss harvesting strategy. Tracking error reflects how closely your account aligns to your target portfolio – and we have a robust risk framework in place to ensure tracking error is minimized while the strategy looks for loss harvesting opportunities.
Investors considering a tax loss harvesting strategy should look at their portfolio holistically, to ensure that they stay on track to their overall investment goals.ENHANCED AFTER-TAX RETURNS

Sector-focused thematic equity strategies are designed to deliver targeted investment exposure. For example, a global equity portfolio that focuses on companies that create or use the innovative technologies that are driving the next wave of digital evolution.
Separately managed thematic fixed income portfolios of individual bonds offer professional management with credit oversight and allow for individual customization. You may be seeking to provide an incremental return over cash. You may be seeking to generate a high level of income over a market cycle with lower volatility than the broad high yield market.",,"

The decisions you make about your assets now can have a profound effect on your family later—potentially for generations. That’s why you have carefully weighed your options and thought hard about the potential outcomes. That’s also why, when J.P. Morgan serves as your executor, we take great care to ease the burden on your loved ones. We help ensure that your wealth ends up right where you want it, in the way you want it.Nearly everyone is surprised by how arduous settling an estate can be. And what it takes to handle all the assets properly. It’s not a job you want to leave to loved ones burdened by grief. It’s best left to professionals with the experience, knowledge and resources to support your family.How we can help with your estate
In whatever way you and your family choose to work with us, we can take care of all or any part of your estate needs as executor. Here’s how:Estate preparation services
Our team analyzes your will and the nature of your assets. We then confer with family members, attorneys and other interested persons about your will’s provisions. Once authorized to act, we arrange for notice to creditors, beneficiaries, bankers, brokers and other investment advisors, and begin opening the estate account.Estate distribution services
As the estate administration progresses, we will be asked at different times to make distributions, including personal property transfers, partial distributions and final distributions. First, we may transfer personal property and fulfill specific bequests to beneficiaries. Once tax returns have been filed and any taxes due paid, we will make partial distributions. Finally, once all returns have been accepted, we will prepare a final accounting of the estate assets and make final distributions.
There are three capacities through which we can serve as steward of your wealth, depending on the level of oversight you seek.
As sole executor:
We take complete responsibility for settlement, administration and estate disposition
As co-executor:
We share responsibility for oversight and administration with other individuals
As an agent for the executor:
An executor hires us to perform administrative duties, but retains the decision-making and ultimate responsibility for the estateEstate administration services
Our team will compile and analyze all of your assets. We inspect the last three years of financial records, identify debts and pay allowable claims against the estate. We are also responsible for preparing tax returns, including estate, income and inheritance taxes, and we address and resolve IRS audits or controversies.A specialization in illiquid assets
Illiquid assets can come with benefits, but also many complexities. Our dedicated teams have the experience and resources to actively manage your non-traditional assets to help protect your family’s wealth now and preserve your legacy into the future.

By financing your fine art, you can find liquidity in your artwork—while keeping every piece in your possession. We can help you expand your collection, fund new investments or pursue other financial goals without disrupting your investment strategy. Fine art financing can be an important source of liquidity, while also providing financial flexibility.Why leverage your artwork?
We enjoy learning about your passions and helping you pursue them. And working together gives us an understanding of what matters to you. When you leverage your collection, the pieces can remain where you want them: on display in your homes, on loan for gallery or museum shows, or stored in a secure facility.
Your art can be more than a passion.
Your museum-quality paintings, drawings and sculptures can be a significant source of liquidity. With fine art financing from the Private Bank, you, as a collector, can potentially gain:
Purchase or bridge financing for the acquisition of artwork
Flexibility to take advantage of investment opportunities
Increased liquidity while keeping your investment portfolio intact
The ability to leverage the value in your artwork and defer capital gains
Attractive interest rates based on your artwork and personal credit profile
When we build a relationship with you, we take into account your full financial picture, including assets and liabilities, liquidity needs, short-term and long-term goals. In addition to our lending, wealth management and wealth transfer resources, you also benefit from our decades of experience in art-based lending. This combination can help ensure that the financing strategy you choose can address your current situation as well as your larger objectives.
Take advantage of a historically low-volatility asset
The value of fine art tends to remain steady over time. As a result, collectors often use the loan proceeds for long-term investments, for example, direct private equity or commercial real estate—assets that can complement more traditional investments.
Diversify your sources of liquidity
Fine art financing, an alternative for accessing liquidity, may help supplement other resources, such as securities-based lines of credit, and increase financial flexibility.
Tax efficiency
Defer potential capital gains that may be triggered by selling appreciated artwork.
How your financing is structured depends upon your individual financial profile as well as your artwork. To begin, we review your personal financial information while a third-party appraisal is performed to determine your artwork’s current market value.

Adding a borrowing strategy to your estate plans can protect your heirs in the future—and your financial position today. For the executors of your estate, paying death taxes may precipitate a liquidity crisis—forcing them to hastily sell assets that would otherwise be inherited by your beneficiaries, or resulting in other undesired outcomes.Many of our clients consider financing their life insurance premiums in order to reduce the gift tax implications of contributing assets to a trust
Daniel Zigman, Executive Director, Lending SpecialistMany of our clients consider financing their life insurance premiums in order to reduce the gift tax implications of contributing assets to a trustDaniel Zigman, Executive Director, Lending SpecialistWhat is Life Insurance Premium Financing?
A way to plan for estate taxes
Life insurance premium financing can help you maximize wealth to your heirs and keep your legacy intact.
One way to protect future heirs is to insure your life so that, at your passing, estate taxes can be paid with the proceeds from a high-value life insurance policy. Typically, in such arrangements, the policy is held separate from the rest of the estate, in a trust.
1
An insurance policy can directly benefit your heirs and other beneficiaries. The proceeds of the policy can be used to:
Cover estate taxes and thereby avoid liquidating assets or disrupting an investment portfolio
Retain control of significant or illiquid assets, such as a concentrated stock position or real estate assets.
Provide funds to sustain a businessWhy borrow?
Not surprisingly, putting such protection in place comes at a significant cost, in the form of annual policy premiums. As a result, many clients elect to finance those costs with a loan collateralized by the cash surrender value of the policy, in addition to marketable securities.
This approach has the added benefit of being tax efficient: the funds that the trust borrows to pay the annual premiums and interest expenses generally are available free of gift taxes.
Financing the cost of a high-value insurance policy can benefit you and ultimately your estate in many ways, now and in the future, by allowing you to:
Maximize insurance coverage without adversely affecting your current cash flow (or lifestyle)
Avoid having to sell assets—and potentially triggering a taxable event—to cover the cost of the premiums
Allow investments within the policy to grow free of income taxes
Gain access to liquidity at an interest rate that is often less expensive than a “policy loan”
A “carry” opportunity may exist as well: If the interest rate charged on the loan is lower than the rate of return earned on the cash value of the policy, there may be potential appreciation.
Life Insurance Premium Financing risks to consider:
There are risks inherent in any borrowing strategy. These include interest rate fluctuation, market volatility and the possibility of collateral shortfall, which may lead to a margin call. Before deciding whether to finance the acquisition of high-value life insurance by borrowing, we encourage you to discuss your objectives with your J.P. Morgan team as well as with your legal and tax advisors.1
Trust should be trusteed with an independent, non-subordinated party to avoid exposure to insurance contract indirect “incidences of ownership” rules set forth under IRS Sec. 2042.Fine art financing

Working with you and your advisors to establish the trust that’s right for you is just the start. We can also implement the kind of cutting-edge fiduciary planning and administration for which Delaware is known.What’s the Delaware difference?
Though several U.S. states have developed trust-friendly legal environments, Delaware is the most established. And was among the first states to provide robust tax and asset preservation benefits for trusts:Flexible administration
Delaware allows you to designate specific powers for your trustees, such as making investments, deciding when distributions are appropriate or providing administration services. This way, you have the flexibility to choose the individual or institution you think is best for each role.Confidentiality
If privacy is important to you, you can generally keep the particulars of a Delaware trust out of the public record. Delaware does not require trusts to be registered, or that trust grantors or beneficiaries be identified. Nor does it require periodic public accounting of trust assets.Silent provisions
You may want to hold off telling your beneficiaries about the trust until you think they’re ready. Under your Delaware trust agreement, you have flexibility about when to tell someone they are the beneficiary of a trust.Enhanced asset protection
Everyone wants to be better prepared for unexpected events. Trust provisions in Delaware may give you stronger protection against claims from creditors and parties in a divorce.Dynasty trusts
Most states have a limit on how long a trust can last. Your Delaware trust may allow you to benefit multiple generations—and enjoy continued tax-efficient growth—with no termination date.Potential for modification
Trusts can last a long time, so having the flexibility to change terms and beneficiaries can be valuable. The Delaware legal system is tried, tested and trust-friendly, and may allow for trust modification as your family’s needs evolve.Favorable tax treatment
Typically, there is no Delaware state income tax on a trust’s income or investment earnings.1

Debunking five myths about sustainable investing
Like many important trends, sustainable investing has spurred both excitement and confusion, for some in roughly equal measure. Misconceptions about the nature, purpose and even the definition of sustainable investing have taken hold, and it’s sometimes hard to find the signal in the noise.
We’ll tackle these misconceptions one by one. But first, we’ll define our terms.
At J.P. Morgan Private Bank, “sustainable investing” is an umbrella term used to describe investment approaches that incorporate financial as well as social and environmental objectives.
We believe in the power of sustainable investing to help drive long-term growth and achieve your goals.
The incorporation of sustainability factors in the investment process can help deliver enhanced, risk-adjusted returns over the long run, and can also help integrate investors’ values and missions with their financial objectives.",,

Impact investments are available across asset classes, but we have seen private markets provide niche possibilities that are scalable, efficient, and cost-effective and they are now more accessible than ever. Impact investing is a moderately new term, used to describe investments made across many asset classes, sectors, and regions. It is estimated that the current market size has reached 1.164 trillion in USD.
